"Isa.10":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah10:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWoe unto them that decree unrighteous decrees, and that write grievousness which they have prescribed;VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 1-4. - The prophecy begun in Isaiah 9:8 terminates with this stanza, which contains a warning against injustice and oppression, addressed to Israel and Judah equally, and accompanied by the threat of a \"day of desolation,\" when those who have refused to make God their Refuge will have no resource, but to go into captivity with the \"prisoners,\" or to perish with the \"slain.\" A foreign conquest, accompanied by slaughter, and the deportation of captives, is not obscurely intimated. Verse 1. - Woe unto them that decree unrighteous decrees (comp. Isaiah 1:17, 20, 26; Isaiah 5:23, etc.). The perversion of judgment from the judgment-seat is the sin rebuked. It was certainly prevalent in Judah, it may also have been practiced in Israel. And that write grievousness, etc. Translate, and unto the writers that enregister oppression. The decrees of courts were, it is clear, carefully engrossed by the officials, probably upon parchment, every outward formality being observed, while justice itself was set at naught.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah10:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTTo turn aside the needy from judgment, and to take away the right from the poor of my people, that widows may be their prey, and that they may rob the fatherless!VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 2. - The poor... the widow... the fatherless. These were the classes who were the chief sufferers by the perversion of justice (comp. Isaiah 1:17, 23). They were exactly the classes for whom God had most compassion, and whom he had commended in the Law to the tender care of his people (see note on Isaiah 9:17).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah10:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd what will ye do in the day of visitation, and in the desolation which shall come from far? to whom will ye flee for help? and where will ye leave your glory?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 3. - What will ye do in the day of visitation? \"The day of visitation\" is the day when God reckons with his servants, and demands an account from each of the work done in his vineyard, being prepared to recompense the good and punish the bad (comp. Hosea 9:7). It is oftenest used in a bad sense because, unhappily, so many more are found to deserve punishment than reward. The desolation which shall come from far; rather, the crashing ruin (Cheyne). It is sudden, and complete destruction, rather than mere desolateness, that is threatened. Previous prophecies, especially Isaiah 7:17-20, had informed the Jews that it was to \"come from far,\" \"by them that were beyond the river.\" To whom will ye flee? The prophet speaks in bitter irony. Is there any one to whom ye can flee? any one who can protect you from the wrath of God? Ye well know there is no one. Where will ye leave your glory? With whom will ye deposit your riches, your magnificence, your jewels, your grand apparel? You cannot save them. They will all make to themselves wings, and \"fly away like a bird\" (Hosea 9:11).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah10:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWithout me they shall bow down under the prisoners, and they shall fall under the slain. For all this his anger is not turned away, but his hand is stretched out still.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 4. - Without me. That this is a possible rendering of the word used seems proved by Hosea 13:4. But here it scarcely suits the context. God does not speak directly, in the first person, elsewhere in the entire prophecy (Isaiah 9:8-10:4), but is spoken of in the third person throughout, as even in the present verse, where we have \"his anger,\" \"his hand.\" It is better, therefore, to give the word its ordinary meaning - \"unless,\" \"except.\" Have they anywhere to flee to, unless they shall crouch amid the captives that are being carried off, or fall amid the slain? In other words, there is no escape for them; they must either submit to captivity or death. For all this, etc. Even when the two kingdoms were destroyed, and the captivity of both was complete, God's wrath was not fully appeased, his anger was not wholly turned away. Both peoples suffered grievous things in their captivity, as appears from the Book of Daniel (Isaiah 3, 6.) and other places. It took seventy years for God's anger to be appeased in the case of Judah (2 Chronicles 36:21), while in the case of Israel it was never appeased. Crushed beneath the iron heel of their conquerors, Israel ceased to exist as a nation. SECTION V. PROPHECIES OF WOE UPON FOREIGN NATIONS (Isaiah 10:5-23)NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah10:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTO Assyrian, the rod of mine anger, and the staff in their hand is mine indignation.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 5-19. - ASSYRIA, AFTER BEING GOD'S INSTRUMENT TO PUNISH ISRAEL, SHALL HERSELF BE PUNISHED IN HER TURN. The wicked are a sword in the hand of God (Psalm 17:13), wherewith he executes his judgments; but this fact is hid from them, and they imagine that they are successful through their own strength and might. So it was with Assyria (vers. 5-14), which its long career of victory had made proud and arrogant above measure. God now, by the mouth of Isaiah, makes known his intention of bringing down the pride of Assyria, and laying her glory in the dust, by a sudden and great destruction (vers. 15:19), after she has served his purposes. Verse 5. - O Assyrian; literally, Ho! Asshur. \"Asshur\" is the nation personified, and is here addressed as an individual. The transition from vers. 1-4 is abrupt, and may be taken to indicate an accidental juxtaposition of two entirely distinct prophecies. Or Assyria may be supposed to have been in the prophet's thought, though not in his words, when he spoke of \"prisoners\" and \"slain\" in the first clause of ver. 4. The rod of mine anger (comp. Jeremiah 51:20, where it is said of Babylon, \"Thou art my battle-axe and weapons of war; for with thee will I break in pieces the nations, and with thee will I destroy the kingdoms\"). So Assyria was now the \"rod\" wherewith God chastised his enemies. The true \"staff\" in the hand of Assyria, wherewith she smote the peoples, was \"God's indignation.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah10:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTI will send him against an hypocritical nation, and against the people of my wrath will I give him a charge, to take the spoil, and to take the prey, and to tread them down like the mire of the streets.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 6. - I will send him against an hypocritical nation; or, against a corrupt nation. Israel in the wider sense, inclusive of Judah, seems to be intended. The people of my wrath; i.e. \"the people who are the object of my wrath.\" Will I give him a charge. In 2 Kings 18:25 Sennacherib nays, \"Am I come up without the Lord (Jehovah) against thin, lace, to destroy it? The Lord (Jehovah) said to me, Go up against this land, and destroy it\" (compare below, Isaiah 36:10). It has been usual to consider Sennacherib's words a vain boast; but if God instructed Nebuchadnezzar through dreams, may he not also by the same means have \"given charges\" to Assyrian monarchs? To take the spoil, and to take the prey; rather, to gather spoil, and seize prey. The terms used carry the thoughts back to Isaiah 8:1-4, and to the symbolic name, Maher-shalal-hash-baz. And to tread them down; literally, to make it a trampling. \"It\" refers to \"nation\" in the first clause.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah10:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHowbeit he meaneth not so, neither doth his heart think so; but it is in his heart to destroy and cut off nations not a few.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 7. - Howbeit he meaneth not so. \"Assyria,\" i.e., \"does not view the matter in this light - is not aware that she is merely God's instrument in working out his will. On the contrary, it is in her heart to destroy the nations for her own advantage, and she imagines that she is doing it by her own strength.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah10:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor he saith, Are not my princes altogether kings?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 8. - Are not my princes altogether kings? One mark of the superiority of Assyria to other countries was to be seen in the fact that her king had not mere officers, but vassal kings under him. Hence the title \"king of kings\" assumed by so many Assyrian monarchs. While conquered territories were by degrees and to a certain extent absorbed into the empire and placed under prefects (see the 'Eponym Canon'), an outer zone of more loosely organized dependencies was always maintained by the Assyrians; and these dependencies continued ordinarily to be administered by their native monarchs (see 'Ancient Monarchies,' vol. 2. pp. 524-526). These are the \"princes\" who were \"altogether kings.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah10:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTIs not Calno as Carchemish? is not Hamath as Arpad? is not Samaria as Damascus?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 9. - Is not Calno as Carehemish? A further proof of superiority, and ground of confidence, lay in the further fact, that the strongest cities had, one and all, succumbed to the Assyrian arms, and been laid in ruins to punish them for offering resistance. Six such cities are mentioned - Calneh, probably Niffer, in Lower Mesopotamia; Carchemish, on the right bank of the Euphrates in Lat. 36° 30' nearly; Hamath, the \"great Hamath\" of Amos (Amos 6:2), in Coelesyria on the routes; Arpad, perhaps Tel-Erfad, near Aleppo; Damascus, and Samaria. Calneh was one of the cities of Nimrod (Genesis 10:10), and, according to the LXX., was \"the place where the tower was built.\" It may have been taken by Tiglath-Pileser in one of his expeditious into Babylonia. Amos (Amos 6:2) speaks of it as desolate in his day. Carchemish (Assyrian Gargamis) was a chief city of the Hittites, and has been called \"their northern capital.\" Long confounded by geographers with Circesium at the junction of the Khabour with the Euphrates, it has recently been proved to have occupied a far more northern position, and is now generally identified with the ruins discovered by Mr. George Smith at Jerabis or Jerabhs. It was conquered by Sargon in B.C. 717, when \"its people were led captive, and scattered over the Assyrian empire, while Assyrian colonists were brought to people the city in their place; Carchemish being formally annexed to Assyria, and placed under an Assyrian governor\" (G. Smith, 'Assyria,' p. 97). Hamath was originally a Canaanite city (Genesis 10:18). By the time of David it had become the scat of an independent monarchy (2 Samuel 8:9, 10), and so continued until its reduction by the Assyrians. We find it leagued with the Hittites, the Syrians of Damascus, and the Israelites against Assyria about B.C. 850 ('Ancient Monarchies,' vol. 2. pp. 361-363). About B.C. 720 it was taken by Sargon, who beheaded its king, and probably reduced it to ruins (ibid., p. 411; comp. Amos 6:2). The name remains in the modern Hamah, where many curious inscriptions have been recently dug up. Arpad was attacked by Tiglath-Pileser in the early part of his reign, and reduced to subjection. It revolted in conjunction with Hamath from Sargon, and was severely punished ('Ancient Monarchies,' l.s.c.). Is not Samaria as Damascus? This mention of Samaria among the subjugated and ruined cities may undoubtedly be prophetic; but the connection with Carchemish, Hamath, and Arpad all of them towns reduced by Sargon within the years B.C. 720-717 - points rather to the verse being historical, and would seem to indicate that the date of the entire prophecy - vers. 5-19 - is subsequent to the capture of the cities, and so not earlier than B.C. 716.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah10:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAs my hand hath found the kingdoms of the idols, and whose graven images did excel them of Jerusalem and of Samaria;VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 10. - As my hand hath found the kingdoms of the idols. \"Found\" here means \"reached,\" \"punished... subjugated.\" It is quite in accordance with Assyrian ideas that the conquered countries should be called \"kingdoms of the idols\" (literally, \"no gods\"). The Assyrian monarchs regarded their own gods as alone really deserving of the name, and made war very much with the object of proving the superiority of their deities over those of their neighbors. Hence their practice of carrying off the idols from the various cities which they conquered, or else of inscribing on them \"the praises of Asshur.\" And whose graven images; rather, and their graven images. Did excel. In preciousness of material or in workmanship, or both. The Assyrians went near to identifying the idols with the gods themselves. Those of Jerusalem and of Samaria. The chief Samaritan idols were the golden calves at Dan and Bethel; but, in addition to these, \"images and groves were set up in every high hill and under every green tree\" (2 Kings 17:10), images of Baal, and Ashtoreth, and perhaps Beltis, and Chemosh, and Moloch. Even in Judah and in Jerusalem itself there were idols. Ahaz \"made molten images for Baalim\" (2 Chronicles 28:2). The brazen serpent was worshipped as an idol at Jerusalem until Hezekiah destroyed it; and probably, even after the reformation of Hezekiah (2 Kings 18:4), many Jews retained privately the images, which he required them to destroy (2 Chronicles 31:1). Isaiah had already declared, speaking of Judah rather than of Israel, \"Their land is full of idols; they worship the work of their own hands, that which their own fingers have made\" (Isaiah 2:8).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah10:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTShall I not, as I have done unto Samaria and her idols, so do to Jerusalem and her idols?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 11. - Shall I not... so do to Jerusalem and her idols? The speaker ignores the fact of any difference in kind between the religion of Judaea and that of the neighboring countries. He speaks as if he knew nothing of any religion without idols. No doubt Assyrian ideas on the subject of the religion of the Jews were at this time, as they were even later (2 Kings 18:22), exceedingly vague and incorrect.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah10:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWherefore it shall come to pass, that when the Lord hath performed his whole work upon mount Zion and on Jerusalem, I will punish the fruit of the stout heart of the king of Assyria, and the glory of his high looks.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 12. - Wherefore; rather, but. The final result shall be such as \"the Assyrian\" little expected. When the Lord hath performed his whole work. The \"work\" assigned to Assyria was the destruction of the kingdom of Israel, and a share in the trial, punishment, and discipline of Judah. The last task seems to have been the humiliation of Manasseh, which brought about his repentance (2 Chronicles 33:11-13). Soon after this the troubles began which led to her destruction. I will punish. The sudden change from the third to the first person is harsh and abnormal, but not without parallels in other passages of Isaiah (see Isaiah 3:1-4; Isaiah 5:3, 4, etc.). The fruit of the stout heart; i.e. the actions, language, etc., which flowed from the stoutness of heart - such language, e.g., as that of vers. 8-11 and 13, 14. Of the King of Assyria. The menace is not leveled against any one particular king, as Sargon, or Sennacherib; but against the monarchy itself, which from first to last was actuated by the same spirit, and breathed the same tone, of pride, selfishness, and cruelty. (See the royal inscriptions, passim, which become more revolting as time goes on.)NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah10:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor he saith, By the strength of my hand I have done it, and by my wisdom; for I am prudent: and I have removed the bounds of the people, and have robbed their treasures, and I have put down the inhabitants like a valiant man:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 13. - For he saith. Neither this speech nor that in vers. 8-11, nor again that given in Isaiah 37:24, 25, is to be regarded as historical in the sense of being the actual utterance of any Assyrian monarch. All are imaginary, speeches, composed by the prophet, whereby he expresses in his own language the thoughts which Assyrian kings entertained in their hearts. I have removed the bounds of the people; rather, of peoples. Assyrian monarchs take as one of their titles \"the remover of boundaries and landmarks\" (G. Smith's 'Assyrian Discoveries,' pp. 243, 244). And have robbed their treasures (comp. 2 Kings 15:19; 2 Kings 18:14-16). The plunder of conquered countries is constantly recorded by the Assyrian monarchs as one of the most important results of each successful expedition. It is not infrequently represented in the sculptures (see 'Ancient Monarchies,' vol. 2. p. 85). I have put down the inhabitants like a valiant man. The passage is obscure; and many different renderings have been given. Perhaps the best is that of Mr. Cheyne, \"I have brought down, like a mighty one, those that sat on thrones.\" Abbir, however, the word translated \"a mighty one,\" as often means \"a bull\" (see Psalm 22:12; Psalm 50:13; Psalm 68:30; Isaiah 34:7; Jeremiah 1:11).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah10:14VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd my hand hath found as a nest the riches of the people: and as one gathereth eggs that are left, have I gathered all the earth; and there was none that moved the wing, or opened the mouth, or peeped.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 14. - My hand hath found as a nest the riches of the people; rather, of the peoples. The Assyrians are fond of comparing their enemies to birds ('Records of the Past,' vol. 7. pp. 36, 62, etc.); but the exact metaphor here used does not, I believe, occur in the inscriptions. The nations' treasures are like eggs found in deserted nests, which the hunter gathers without any, even the slightest, risk. All the earth. Oriental hyperbole. Assyrian monarchs often say that they \"have subdued all the races of men,\" or \"carried the glory of their name to the ends of the earth,\" or \"overthrown the armies of the whole world in battle.\" Peeped; rather, chirped (see note on Isaiah 8:19). None of the inhabitants offered even such feeble resistance as a bird makes when its nest is robbed.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah10:15VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTShall the axe boast itself against him that heweth therewith? or shall the saw magnify itself against him that shaketh it? as if the rod should shake itself against them that lift it up, or as if the staff should lift up itself, as if it were no wood.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 15. - Shall the axe boast itself? Here the prophet takes the word, and rebukes Assyria for her folly in forgetting, or not perceiving, that she is a mere instrument, like an axe, a saw, a rod, or a stuff. The saw... him that shaketh it; rather, him that moveth it to and fro. The action of sawing is alluded to. As if the rod should shake itself against them that lift it up; rather, as if a rod were to move them to and fro that lift it up. For Assyria to assert herself as if she were independent of God is like a rod attempting to sway the hand that holds it. It is a complete inversion of the natural order of things. Or as if the staff should lift up itself, as if it were no wood. Translate, or as if d staff should lift up that which is not wood; i.e. \"as if a staff should take action and lift up its holder, who is not wood, but flesh and blood.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah10:16VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTTherefore shall the Lord, the Lord of hosts, send among his fat ones leanness; and under his glory he shall kindle a burning like the burning of a fire.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 16. - Therefore shall the Lord... send among his fat ones leanness. A continuation of ver. 12, showing what the nature of Assyria's punishment shall be. The prophet expresses it by two images - first, that of a wasting sickness; and secondly, that of a fire. The first image expresses that gradual decay of national spirit which saps the vital strength of a nation; the second is more suited to denote some external attack under which the weakened nation should succumb. There are traces, in the later history of Assyria, both of increasing internal weakness through luxury and effeminacy, and of violent external attacks culminating in the combined Median and Babylonian invasion, before which her power collapsed (Abyden. ap. Euseb., 'Chronicles Can.,' pars i.e. 9; Syncell., 'Chronograph.,' p, 210, B; Tobit 14:15).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah10:17VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the light of Israel shall be for a fire, and his Holy One for a flame: and it shall burn and devour his thorns and his briers in one day;VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 17. - The light of Israel. A new name of God. The idea on which it is based may be found in the Psalms (Psalm 27:1; Psalm 84:11), and again in Isaiah (Isaiah 60:19). God enlightens his people, cheers them, comforts them spiritually, as the light of the sun enlightens, cheers, and comforts men physically. Christ, as true God, is \"the true Light, which lighteth every man that cometh into the world\" (John 1:9). Shall be for a fire. As the same material fire which gives light, warmth, and comfort may burn and destroy, so the spiritual light, finding fit material, scorches and consumes. The fire which devours Assyria is to be kindled by God. His Holy One; i.e. \"the Holy One of Israel\" (see Isaiah 1:4). It shall burn and devour his thorns and his briers. The destruction of Assyria shall resemble that of Israel, in which Assyria was the instrument (Isaiah 9:18). It shall be as complete, as terrible, and as final. In one day. Scarcely \"in one battle\" (Cheyne); for the destruction of Assyria was effected by many battles, many sieges, and much exhausting ravage. \"In one day\" rather means \"at one and the same time,\" \"within a brief space.\" It is not to he taken literally.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah10:18VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd shall consume the glory of his forest, and of his fruitful field, both soul and body: and they shall be as when a standardbearer fainteth.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 18. - Forest... fruitful field. \"Forest\" and \"fruitful field\" (carmel) are sometimes united together, sometimes contrasted. Literally, they denote wild and cultivated woodland. Used symbolically, as here, they are not so much intended to designate different parts of Assyria's glory, as to convey the idea that the destruction will be universal. Both soul and body. Here metaphor is suddenly dropped, and Isaiah shows that he is speaking of the Assyrian people, not of the land or its products. Their destruction, wicked as they were, would be one both of body and soul. As when a standard-bearer fainteth; rather, as when one that is faint fainteth. Utter prostration and exhaustion is indicated, whichever way the passage is translated.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah10:19VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the rest of the trees of his forest shall be few, that a child may write them.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 19. - The rest of the trees; i.e. these that escape the burning - shall be few; literally, a number; i.e. so few that their number shall be apparent.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah10:20VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd it shall come to pass in that day, that the remnant of Israel, and such as are escaped of the house of Jacob, shall no more again stay upon him that smote them; but shall stay upon the LORD, the Holy One of Israel, in truth.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 20-34. - CONSOLATION FOR THE FAITHFUL IN ISRAEL. The destruction of Assyria shall be followed - how soon, is not said - by the return of a \"remnant of Israel,\" not so much to their own land, as to God (vers. 20, 21). The remnant, however, shall be but a remnant - judgment shall have overtaken the balk of the people (vers. 22, 23). Still, there is reason for the faithful to take courage and be of good heart; Assyria will shortly receive a check (vers. 24-27) - when her armies swoop upon Jerusalem, God will swoop down on her (vers. 28-34). Verse 20. - In that day; i.e. \"at that time\" - the time of the destruction of Assyria. The remnant of Israel (see Isaiah 1:9). Isaiah had indicated his firm belief in the existence of this faithful remnant and its return, in the name which he had given to his son, Shear-Jashub (see note on Isaiah 7:3). The escaped. Those who escape from the destruction to be caused by the Assyrian invasion. Shall no more again stay upon him that smote them. We are told in the Second Book of Chronicles (2 Chronicles 28:23) that Abaz \"sacrificed to the gods of Damascus which smote him\" - and we know that he also trusted to Tiglath-Pileser, who \"distressed him and strengthened him not\" (2 Chronicles 28:21). Among the \"remnant\" there shall be no such mistaken confidences. But shall stay upon the Lord; i.e. \"shall put their trust in God; and him only\" (comp. 2 Samuel 22:19; Psalm 18:18).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah10:21VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe remnant shall return, even the remnant of Jacob, unto the mighty God.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 21. - The mighty God (comp. Isaiah 9:6). The name is not, however, Messianic in this place.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah10:22VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor though thy people Israel be as the sand of the sea, yet a remnant of them shall return: the consumption decreed shall overflow with righteousness.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 22, 23. - These verses are exegetical of the term \"remnant,\" and bring out its full force. The promise had been made to Abraham that his seed should be \"like the sand of the sea for multitude\" (Genesis 22:17). This promise had been fulfilled (1 Kings 4:20); but now the sins of the people would produce a reversal of it. It would be a remnant, and only a remnant, of the nation that would escape. Judah would have to make a fresh start as from a new beginning (see Ezra 2:64). Verse 22. - The consumption decreed shall overflow with righteousness; rather, the consummation (Daniel 9:27) determined on is one that overflows with righteousness (comp. Isaiah 28:22). The prophet means that God is about to visit the land in such a spirit of severe justice that it cannot be expected that more than a remnant will survive the awful visitation.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah10:23VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor the Lord GOD of hosts shall make a consumption, even determined, in the midst of all the land.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 23. - The Lord... shall make a consumption; rather, a consummation - a final and decisive end of things. Even determined; i.e. \"determined on beforehand.\" In the midst of all the land. \"Throughout the entire land,\" not merely in some portions of it.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah10:24VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTTherefore thus saith the Lord GOD of hosts, O my people that dwellest in Zion, be not afraid of the Assyrian: he shall smite thee with a rod, and shall lift up his staff against thee, after the manner of Egypt.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 24. - O my people... be not afraid. God now addresses those who are faithful to him among the people; they have no need to fear - he will bring them safely through all the coming troubles. He shall smite thee; rather, if he smite thee; or, though he smite thee. After the manner of Egypt; i.e. as the Egyptians did in the oppression that preceded the Exodus. The yoke of Assyria was heavy even upon the nations that submitted to her. She claimed to march her armies through their territories at her pleasure, and probably pressed men and cattle into her service. She exacted a heavy tribute, and otherwise \"distressed\" her many vassals.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah10:25VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor yet a very little while, and the indignation shall cease, and mine anger in their destruction.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 25. - The indignation shall cease; rather, there shall be an end of wrath; i.e. \"my wrath against Israel shall come to an end\" - Israel having been sufficiently punished. And mine auger in their destruction; rather, and my anger shall be to their destruction; i.e. to the destruction of the Assyrians (see the margin of the Revised Version).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah10:26VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the LORD of hosts shall stir up a scourge for him according to the slaughter of Midian at the rock of Oreb: and as his rod was upon the sea, so shall he lift it up after the manner of Egypt.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 26. - The Lord... shall stir up a scourge for him; or, lift up a scourge over him. Isaiah uses the metaphor of the \"scourge\" again in Isaiah 28:16, 18. It is rare in Scripture, though common among the Greek and Latin writers. According to the slaughter of Midian at the rock of Oreb (comp. Isaiah 9:4). The \"slaughter of Midian at the rock of Oreb\" was that great destruction of the Midianites which was begun by the three hundred under Gideon, and completed by the men of Ephraim, whereof we have an account in Judges 7:19-25. Its counterpart in Assyrian history would seem to be the destruction of Sennacherib's army, as related in 2 Kings 19:35. As his rod was upon the sea. An allusion to the drowning of Pharaoh's host in the Red Sea. This was a nearer parallel to the destruction of Sennacherib's army than the slaughter of the Midianites, since it was wholly miraculous. By \"his rod\" we may understand the rod of Moses, endued by God with miraculous powers (Exodus 4:3, 4; Exodus 14:16, 27). After the manner of Egypt; i.e. \"after the manner of his action in Egypt.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah10:27VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd it shall come to pass in that day, that his burden shall be taken away from off thy shoulder, and his yoke from off thy neck, and the yoke shall be destroyed because of the anointing.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 27. - The yoke shall be destroyed because of the anointing; literally, before the oil; i.e. \"the Anointed One\" - primarily Hezekiah, \"the anointed of the Lord\" (2 Samuel 19:21; 2 Kings 11:12; Lamentations 4:20) for the time being, but with a further refer-once to the Messiah, who breaks all the bands of the wicked asunder, and casts away their cords from him (Psalm 2:2, 3); and who is represented by each prince of the house of David, as he was by David himself.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah10:28VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHe is come to Aiath, he is passed to Migron; at Michmash he hath laid up his carriages:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 28-32. - This graphic portraiture of the march of an Assyrian army on Jerusalem is probably not historic, but prophetic. Isaiah sees it in vision (Isaiah 1:1), and describes it like an eye-witness. There are at present no sufficient means of deciding to what particular attack it refers, or indeed whether the march is one conducted by Sennacherib or Sargon. Sargon calls himself in one inscription \"conqueror of the land of Judah\" (Layard, 'Inscriptions,' 33:8), and the details of the present prophecy, especially ver. 9, suit the reign of Sargon rather than that of his son, so that on the whole it is perhaps most probable that some expedition of Sargon's is portrayed. Verse 28. - He is come to Aiath. \"Aiath\" is probably Ai (Joshua 8:1-28), with a feminine termination. It lay about three miles south of Bethel, which had become Assyrian with the conquest of Samaria. If an Assyrian army mustered at Bethel, it would naturally enter Judaean territory at Ai. He is passed to Migron; rather, he has passed through Migron. \"Migron\" is mentioned as a village in the territory of Gibeah of Benjamin (1 Samuel 14:2); but the Migron of this passage must have been further to the north. He hath laid up his carriages; i.e. \"has left his baggage-train.\" Michmash was about seven miles nearly due north of Jerusalem. The heavy baggage might conveniently be left there, especially as it was difficult of attack (1 Samuel 14:4-13), while a lightly equipped body of troops made a dash at Jerusalem.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah10:29VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThey are gone over the passage: they have taken up their lodging at Geba; Ramah is afraid; Gibeah of Saul is fled.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 29. - They are gone over the passage. The \"passage of Michmash\" (1 Samuel 13:23) - the deeply sunken valley, called now the Wady Sutveinit, between Michmash (Mukkmas) and Geba (Jeba). They have taken up their lodging at Geba; or, at Geba they rest for the night. Having crossed the wady, they bivouac on the crest of the hills enclosing it on the south. Ramah... Gibeah of Saul. Ramah is, no doubt, Er-Ram, a village on an eminence, as the name implies, about six miles north of Jerusalem, and on the direct road from Beitin. Gibeah of Saul is thought to have occupied the site of the modern Tuleil-el-Ful, two miles nearer Jerusalem. It is certainly a distinct place from Geba. The inhabitants evacuate these two places during the night.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah10:30VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTLift up thy voice, O daughter of Gallim: cause it to be heard unto Laish, O poor Anathoth.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 30. - Lift up thy voice, O daughter of Gallim. Gallim and Laish must have been villages between Geba and Jerusalem; but it is impossible to fix their site. Anathoth (now Aaata) obtains mention in Joshua as a city of refuge in the territory of Benjamin (Joshua 21:18). It was Jeremiah's birthplace (Jeremiah 1:1). Gallim was the birthplace of the man who became the second husband of Michal, Saul's daughter. Laish is not elsewhere mentioned. Cause it to be heard unto Laish; rather, hearken, O Laisha.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah10:31VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTMadmenah is removed; the inhabitants of Gebim gather themselves to flee.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 31. - Madmenah...Gebim. These are, like Gallim and Laisha, villages otherwise unknown. They must have been within a mile or two of Jerusalem, towards the north. Their inhabitants fly as the Assyrians approach.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah10:32VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAs yet shall he remain at Nob that day: he shall shake his hand against the mount of the daughter of Zion, the hill of Jerusalem.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 32. - As yet shall he remain at Nob that day; literally, yet that day (is he) at Nob to halt. The Assyrians pitch their camp at Nob, the priestly city destroyed by Saul (1 Samuel 22:19), 1 which was evidently within sight of Jerusalem. Major Wilson's conjecture, that it occupied the site of the later Scopus, is probable.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah10:33VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBehold, the Lord, the LORD of hosts, shall lop the bough with terror: and the high ones of stature shall be hewn down, and the haughty shall be humbled.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 33. - The Lord... shall lop the bough with terror. A check to the Assyrian arms is intended, but of what nature is not clear. The \"lopping of the bough with terror\" might indicate a panic, such as that which seized the Syrians and made Benhadad II. raise the siege of Samaria (2 Kings 7:6, 7). But the expressions used later on,\" hewn down,\" \"cut down,\" \"shall fall,\" rather imply a defeat.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah10:34VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he shall cut down the thickets of the forest with iron, and Lebanon shall fall by a mighty one.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 34. - He shall cut down; or, one shall eat down; Jehovah being, no doubt, intended. Lebanon (comp. Ezekiel 31:3, \"Behold, the Assyrian was a cedar in Lebanon\"). Here the comparison is enlarged, and Assyria appears as Lebanon itself with all its cedar woods. By a mighty one; rather, a glorious one (comp. Isaiah 33:21, where the word here used - adir - is an epithet of Jehovah).NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINE","Isa.11":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah11:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd there shall come forth a rod out of the stem of Jesse, and a Branch shall grow out of his roots:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 1-9. - A RENEWED PROPHECY OF MESSIAH AND OF HIS KINGDOM. This chapter is closely connected with the preceding. With the final destruction of Assyria, which, being cut down, sends out no shoot (Isaiah 10:33, 34), is contrasted the recuperative energy of Israel, which, though equally leveled with the ground (Isaiah 9:18, 19), shall spring afresh into life, and \"renew its youth.\" The recovery is connected - or rather identified with the coming of Messiah, whose character is beautifully portrayed (vers. 2-5). An elaborate description of Messiah's kingdom follows (vers. 6-10) - an expansion of the briefer one in Isaiah 2:3, 4. Verse 1. - There shall come forth a rod out of the stem of Jesse. The blasted and ruined \"stem\" or stock of Jesse, cut down, and for ages hidden from sight, shall suddenly put forth a sprout - a young green sapling, tender vet vigorous, weak seemingly, yet foil of life (comp. Job 14:7-9, \"There is hope of a tree, if it he cut down, that it will sprout again, and that the tender branch thereof will not crease. Though the root thereof wax old in the earth, and the stock thereof die in the ground; yet through the scent of water it will bud, and bring forth boughs like a plant\"). \"The stem of Jesse\" must mean the house of David, for there is but one Jesse (Ishai) in Scripture - David's father. A Branch shall grow out of his roots. That which is at first a sapling gains strength and grows into a \"branch\" (see Isaiah 4:2, where the word used, though different, is synonymous).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah11:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the spirit of the LORD shall rest upon him, the spirit of wisdom and understanding, the spirit of counsel and might, the spirit of knowledge and of the fear of the LORD;VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 2. - The Spirit of the Lord shall rest upon him (comp, Matthew 3:16; Luke 2:40; Luke 4:1, 14, 18; John 3:34, etc.). The human nature of our Lord required, and received abundantly, the sanctifying and enlightening influences of the Holy Spirit. These influences were not in him transient or occasional, as in too many men, who more or less \"resist the Spirit,\" but permanent and enduring. They \"rested upon\" him; from first to last never quitted, and never will quit, him. The spirit of wisdom and understanding. The influences of the Holy Spirit are manifold, affecting the entire complex nature of man (see 1 Corinthians 12:8-11). Here, three pairs of graces are set forth as specially manifested in the Messiah through the power of the Spirit:NEWLINENEWLINE(1) \"Wisdom and understanding,\" or intellectual and moral apprehension (εὐσυνεσία) the ability to perceive moral and abstract truth;NEWLINENEWLINE(2) \"counsel and might,\" or the power at once to scheme and originate, and also to carry out thought into act;NEWLINENEWLINE(3) \"The knowledge and the fear of the Lord,\" or acquaintance with the true will of God, combined with the determination to carry out that will to the full (John 4:34; Luke 22:42; Hebrews 10:7). It is needless to say that all these qualities existed in the greatest perfection in our blessed Lord.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah11:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd shall make him of quick understanding in the fear of the LORD: and he shall not judge after the sight of his eyes, neither reprove after the hearing of his ears:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 3. - And shall make him of quick understanding. This rendering of the original, though defended by Dr. Kay, is quite without support from any other passage where the same word is used. Modern writers almost all translate, either \"the breath of his nostrils shall be in the fear of the Lord\" (Herder, Ewald, Meier, Cheyne), or \"a sweet savor shall he find in the fear of the Lord\" (Gesenius, Delitzsch, Rosenmüller, Knobel). He shall not judge after the sight of his eyes. \"God sooth the heart.\" Our Lord \"knew men's thoughts\" (Matthew 9:4, etc.), and therefore did not need to \"judge according to the appearance\" (John 7:24). Thus his judgments were always righteous.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah11:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut with righteousness shall he judge the poor, and reprove with equity for the meek of the earth: and he shall smite the earth with the rod of his mouth, and with the breath of his lips shall he slay the wicked.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 4. - With righteousness shall he judge the poor (comp. Isaiah 32:1, \"A king shall reign in righteousness\"). It would be characteristic of the Messiah's rule that the poor should be eared for, that oppression should cease, and judgment be no more perverted in favor of the rich. There is an intended contrast between the Messiah's rule in this respect, and that of the princes of Judah (Isaiah 1:23; Isaiah 3:15; Isaiah 10:1, 2). Christian countries still, for the most part, follow their Lord's example in this particular, if in no other, having judges that are incorruptible, and tribunals that are free from any leaning against the poor. Reprove; or, plead (as in Job 16:21). The meek of the earth; rather, the humble, or afflicted. Low condition, not meekness of spirit, is what the word used expresses. He shall smite the earth. A slight alteration of the text produces the meaning, be shall smite the terrible one (comp. Isaiah 29:20), which improves the parallelism of the clauses. But there is no need of any alteration, parallelism in Isaiah being often incomplete. The Messiah at his coming will \"smite the earth\" generally (see Malachi 4:6, and comp. Matthew 10:34, \"I came not to send peace on the earth, but a sword\"), and will also especially chastise \"the wicked.\" The rod of his mouth... the breath of his lips. \"The Word of God is quick, and powerful, and sharper than any two-edged sword, piercing even to the dividing asunder of soul and spirit, and of the joints and marrow, and is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart\" (Hebrews 4:12). The sayings of Christ pierce the conscience and penetrate the soul as no other words that ever came from a human mouth. In the last day words from his mouth will consign to everlasting life or to everlasting destruction.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah11:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd righteousness shall be the girdle of his loins, and faithfulness the girdle of his reins.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 5. - Righteousness shall be the girdle of his loins, etc.; i.e. \"righteousness shall be ever with him, ever ready for active use, ever (as it were) bracing him for action.\" Assuredly, he was \"righteous in all his ways, and holy in all his works\" (Psalm 145:17). Faithfulness (comp. Ephesians 6:14, \"Having your loins girt about with truth\").NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah11:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe wolf also shall dwell with the lamb, and the leopard shall lie down with the kid; and the calf and the young lion and the fatling together; and a little child shall lead them.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 6-9. - Messiah's kingdom, when fully realized, shall be one of perfect peace. \"They shall neither hurt nor destroy in all his holy mountain.\" Primarily, no doubt, the passage is figurative, and points to harmony among men, who, in Messiah's kingdom, shall no longer prey one upon another (see especially ver. 9). But, from the highest spiritual standpoint, the figure itself becomes a reality, and it is seen that, if in the \"new heavens and new earth\" there is an animal creation, it will be fitting that there harmony should equally prevail among the inferior creation. Human sin may not have introduced rapine and violence among the beasts - at least, geologists tell us that animals preyed one upon another long before the earth was the habitation of man - but still man's influence may prevail to eradicate the beasts' natural impulses and educate them to something higher. Already domestication produces an accord and harmony that is in a certain sense against nature. May not this be carried further in the course of ages, and Isaiah's picture have a literal fulfillment? Jerome's scorn of the notion as a poetic dream has about it something harsh and untender. Will not God realize all, and more than all, of love and happiness that poets' dreams can reach to? Verse 6. - The wolf... the leopard... the young lion... the bear are the only ferocious animals of Palestine, where the tiger, the crocodile, the alligator, and the jaguar are unknown. That the Palestinian bear was carnivorous, and a danger to man, appears by Lamentations 3:10; Daniel 7:5; Amos 5:19. A little child shall lead them. Man's superiority over the brute creation shall continue, and even be augmented. The most powerful beasts shall submit to the control of a child.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah11:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the cow and the bear shall feed; their young ones shall lie down together: and the lion shall eat straw like the ox.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 7. - The lion shall eat straw (comp.

Cats are fond of some kinds of vegetable food.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah11:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the sucking child shall play on the hole of the asp, and the weaned child shall put his hand on the cockatrice' den.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 8. - The sucking child shall play on the hole of the asp; rather, by the hole - near it. The \"asp\" is probably the Coluber Naje of Egypt, whose bite is very deadly. The cockatrice den. The \"cockatrice\" is another deadly serpent, perhaps the Daboia xanthina (Tristram, 'Natural Hist. of the Bible').NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah11:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThey shall not hurt nor destroy in all my holy mountain: for the earth shall be full of the knowledge of the LORD, as the waters cover the sea.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 9. - My holy mountain. As the Jewish Church is always bound up with the \"holy hill of Zion,\" so the Messianic one receives the designation of \"the mountain of the Lord\" (Isaiah 2:3; Isaiah 30:29; Micah 4:2), or \"the holy mountain\" (Zechariah 8:3). What was physically true of the type is transferred to the antitype, which is \"a city set upon a hill\" in a certain sense. The earth shall be full of the knowledge of the Lord (romp. Habakkuk 2:14; Joel 2:28; Matthew 28:29). A fruitful knowledge, guiding and influencing conduct, seems to be intended (see below, Isaiah 54:13, \"All thy children shall be taught of the Lord, and great shall be the peace of thy children\"). As the waters cover the sea; i.e. \"as the ocean covers and fills the bed prepared for it.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah11:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd in that day there shall be a root of Jesse, which shall stand for an ensign of the people; to it shall the Gentiles seek: and his rest shall be glorious.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 10-13. - THE JEWS AND GENTILES SHALL BE GATHERED TOGETHER INTO MESSIAH'S KINGDOM. It is characteristic of \"the evangelical prophet\" that he dwells earnestly and frequently on the calling of the Gentiles (see Isaiah 2:2; Isaiah 19:22-25; Isaiah 25:6; Isaiah 27:13, etc.). The prophecies to Abraham had repeatedly declared that \"in him,\" or \"in his seed,\" \"all the families of the earth should be blessed\" (Genesis 12:3; Genesis 18:18; Genesis 22:18; Genesis 26:4); and some of the psalmists had echoed the glad sound and spoken of God as worshipped generally by \"the nations\" (Psalm 117:1; Psalm 148:11). But the idea had taken little hold upon the chosen people generally; and was practically new to them when Isaiah was inspired to preach it afresh. To render it the more palatable, he unites with it the promise of a great gathering of the dispersed Israelites from all quarters to the banner of Messiah, when it is set up. Verse 10. - There shall he a root of Jesse. The \"root\" of this place is the same as the \"rod\" and \"branch\" of ver. 1. The \"rod\" springs up out of a \"root,\" and is inseparably connected with it. Which shall stand for an ensign of the people; rather, of the peoples. The \"rod\" shall lift itself up, and become an ensign, seen from afar, and attracting to itself the attention of \"the peoples\" or \"nations\" generally. The Acts and Epistles show how speedily this prophecy was fulfilled. Greeks, Romans, Galatians, Cappadoeians, Babylonians (1 Peter 5:13), saw the ensign, and sought to it. His rest shall be glorious; rather, his resting-place; i.e. his Church, with which he abides forever (Matthew 28:20). The Shechinah of his presence makes the Church \"glorious\" (literally, \"a glory\") throughout all ages; but the glory will not fully appear till the time of the \"new heavens and new earth\" (Isaiah 65:17; Roy. 21, 22.), when he will dwell visibly with it.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah11:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd it shall come to pass in that day, that the Lord shall set his hand again the second time to recover the remnant of his people, which shall be left, from Assyria, and from Egypt, and from Pathros, and from Cush, and from Elam, and from Shinar, and from Hamath, and from the islands of the sea.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 11. - The Lord shall set his hand again the second time to recover, etc. The first recovery was from the servitude in Egypt. Isaiah now foresees that there will be a dispersion of the Israelites through several distant lands, instead of a mere transference of them from one land to another, as in Jacob's time (Genesis 46:1-29). God, who brought them out of Egypt, will likewise some day \"set his hand\" to recover them from the various countries through which they will have been dispersed, and restore them to their own land once more. The first fulfillment of the prophecy was undoubtedly, the return from the Babylonian captivity. A secondary fulfillment may have been the gathering of so many Jews from all quarters into the Christian Church (Acts 2:9-41). It is possible that there may be ultimately a further fulfillment in a final gathering together of Israel into their own land. From Assyria. Assyria is placed first because already the bulk of the Israelites, as distinct from the Jews, had been carried into Assyria by Tiglath-Pileser (2 Kings 15:29) and Sargon (2 Kings 17:6; 2 Kings 18:11), and were captives there at the time when Isaiah wrote. The transportation of Israelites to the other places mentioned was subsequent to his day. Egypt... Pathros. There was a great migration of Jews into Egypt in the time of Jeremiah (Jeremiah 43:7; Jeremiah 44:1), and a steady influx for some generations under the early Ptolemies. There was also a second large migration in the time of Onias. The Jewish element in Alexandria for some centuries both before and after Christ was very considerable. Pathros was probably a portion of Upper Egypt, perhaps the Phaturite nome, which was the district about Thebes. It is mentioned as the residence of certain Jews in the time of Jeremiah (Jeremiah 44:1, 15). From Cush. \"Cush\" here may he either the African or the Asiatic. It is slightly in favor of the African that we hear in the Acts of an Ethiopian eunuch who was a Jew in the service of Candace, Queen of the African Ethiopia (Acts 8:27). And it is against the Asiatic that it was so remote. It adjoined, however, upon Elam. From Elam, and from Shinar. \"Elam\" was the fertile tract of alluvial land to the east of the Tigris, between that stream and the mountains, parallel with Babylonia. Its capital was Susa, and in Isaiah's time it was an important country, frequently at war with Assyria. Shinar was an ancient name of Babylonia (Genesis 10:10; Genesis 11:1-9). The word is used also by Daniel (Daniel 1:2) and Zechariah (Zechariah 5:11). Some regard it as meaning \"the land of the two fleers.\" From Hamath. (On this town, see note to Isaiah 10:9.) From the islands of the sea; i.e. the islands and coasts of the Mediterranean. During the Maccabee period, there was a gradual spread of Jews over the Western world. Alliances were made with Rome end Sparta (1 Macc. 8:1 1 Macc. 12:2-21 1 Macc. 14:20-23, etc.), and Jews became familiar with both Greece and Italy. St. Paul finds numerous Jews at Rome, and in almost every city of Greece.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah11:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he shall set up an ensign for the nations, and shall assemble the outcasts of Israel, and gather together the dispersed of Judah from the four corners of the earth.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 12. - He shall set up an ensign for the nations (comp. ver. 10). Christ is the Ensign. God sets it up to draw the nations to his standard. The outcasts of Israel... the dispersed of Judah. \"Outcasts\" is masculine, \"the dispersed\" feminine. The meaning is, \"He shall gather together the outcasts and dispersed of both Israel and Judah, both male and female.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah11:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe envy also of Ephraim shall depart, and the adversaries of Judah shall be cut off: Ephraim shall not envy Judah, and Judah shall not vex Ephraim.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 13. - The envy also of Ephraim shall depart. In the kingdom of the Prince of Peace there shall no longer be quarrels or jealousies among the members. Old feuds shall be put aside; the northern and southern tribes shall agree together, and there shall be peace and harmony throughout the entire Church. Adversaries of Judah. If any such remain among the Ephraimites, Divine vengeance shall \"cut them off,\" that there be no open disturbance of the harmony.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah11:14VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut they shall fly upon the shoulders of the Philistines toward the west; they shall spoil them of the east together: they shall lay their hand upon Edom and Moab; and the children of Ammon shall obey them.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 14-16. - THE UNITED CHURCH SHALL TRIUMPH OVER ITS ENEMIES. PHYSICAL OBSTACLES TO ITS UNION GOD WILL REMOVE. Israel's most persistent enemies had been the border-nations of the Philistines, the Edomites, the Arabs, Moab and Ammon. These are now taken as types of the enemies of the Church, and victory over them is promised (ver. 14). A further promise is made that physical difficulties shall not prevent the return of the Jewish exiles from distant countries (vers. 15, 16). Verse 14. - They shall fly upon the shoulders of the philistines. It is not to be supposed that actual war is intended. The subjects of the Prince of Peace will not draw the sword. But the Church will for many centuries be confronted by enemies, and must contend with them with legitimate weapons. It is this warfare of which Isaiah now speaks. The united Church will be strong enough to assail her enemies on all sides, and will \"swoop\" upon the border country of the Philistines like a bird of prey. They shall spoil them of the east; or, the Bent Kedem. The phrase is commonly used in an ethnic sense of the nomadic Arabs inhabiting the deserts east of Jordan, beyond the Ammonite and Moabite country, from whose raids Palestine frequently suffered (see Jeremiah 49:28, 29; Ezekiel 25:4, 10).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah11:15VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the LORD shall utterly destroy the tongue of the Egyptian sea; and with his mighty wind shall he shake his hand over the river, and shall smite it in the seven streams, and make men go over dryshod.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 15. - The Lord shall utterly destroy; rather, shall lay under a curse (Aquila, ἀναθεματίσει). The tongue of the Egyptian sea. Either the Gulf of Suez or that of Akabah. God shall do away with those obstacles which keep the nations apart and prevent ready intercourse. Both gulfs are thought to have extended anciently considerably further inland than they do at present. With his mighty wind; rather, with the might of his breath (in fortitudine spiritus sui, Vulgate). Shall he shake his hand. A gesture of menace (comp. Isaiah 10:32). Over the river. \"The river\" (hun-unbar) is, as usually, the Euphrates, the great river of Western Asia. And smite it in the seven streams; rather, and smite it into seven streams; i.e. divide its waters among seven channels, so that it may be readily forded, and cease to be a barrier.

This is the object in view - the free and unhindered passage of his people from the various regions where they are scattered (ver. 11) to their resting-place in Palestine.NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINE","Isa.12":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah12:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd in that day thou shalt say, O LORD, I will praise thee: though thou wast angry with me, thine anger is turned away, and thou comfortedst me.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 1-6. - THE SONG OF THANKSGIVING OF THE UNITED CHURCH. On each of her deliverances the Church is hound to praise God. In some parts of the Church it is customary on every such occasion to sing a \"Te Deum.\" The ordinary Israelite hymn of praise appears to have been the hundred and thirty-sixth psalm (1 Chronicles 16:34, 41; 2 Chronicles 5:13; 2 Chronicles 7:3; Ezra 3:11; Jeremiah 33:11; 1 Macc. 4:24); but on extraordinary occasions special thanksgivings were sung (Exodus 15:1-21; 1 Samuel 7:18-29, etc.). Isaiah is now inspired to give a pattern song, suitable for the Church to sing when she is reunited, enlarged, and restored to favor. Verse 1. - In that day. In the day of deliverance and restoration. Though thou wast angry; literally, because thou wast angry. Kay understands an actual hank-fullness for the severe discipline, which had checked them, and not allowed them to glide on smoothly to ruin. But perhaps the idiom is rather that of the passage, \"Father, I thank thee that thou hast hid these things from the wise and prudent, and hast revealed them unto babes\" (Matthew 11:25), where it is only the last clause that expresses the true object of the thanksgiving. Comfortedst; rather, hast comforted, since the effect continued.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah12:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBehold, God is my salvation; I will trust, and not be afraid: for the LORD JEHOVAH is my strength and my song; he also is become my salvation.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 2. - God is my salvation (comp. Psalm 27:1; Psalm 38:22, etc.). The employment of the abstract \"salvation\" for the concrete \"Savior\" is extremely common. The Lord Jehovah; literally, Jab Jehovah - a combination which occurs only here and in Isaiah 26:4, where it is again used as an encouragement to perfect confidence and trust. Is my strength... salvation. This is quoted from the song of Moses (Exodus 15:2), which the prophet has throughout in his thoughts.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah12:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTTherefore with joy shall ye draw water out of the wells of salvation.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 3. - With joy shall ye draw water. The prophet interrupts the song to give a comforting promise. The \"salvation\" granted to the Church shall be as an inexhaustible well, from which all comers may draw continually. Compare our Lord's promise to the woman of Samaria in John 4:14.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah12:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd in that day shall ye say, Praise the LORD, call upon his name, declare his doings among the people, make mention that his name is exalted.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 4. - Declare his doings among the people; literally, among the peoples (comp. Psalm 9:11; Psalm 77:12; Psalm 107:22; Psalm 118:17). It is always regarded as one of man's chief duties to testify of God's goodness to others. Here Israel is called upon to publish God's mercies and great deeds to the Gentiles. His name is exalted. God is in his Name, and his Name expresses his nature. As there is nothing so exalted in all the universe as God, so there is no name so exalted as his Name. Hence his Name is protected by an express commandment.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah12:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTSing unto the LORD; for he hath done excellent things: this is known in all the earth.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 5. - Sing unto the Lord; for he hath done excellent things. This is another quotation, very slightly modified, from the song of Moses, in which these words were part of the refrain (Exodus 15:1, 21). This is known; rather, let this be known; i.e. publish it - noise it abroad.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah12:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTCry out and shout, thou inhabitant of Zion: for great is the Holy One of Israel in the midst of thee.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 6. - Cry out and shout, thou inhabitant of Zion; i.e. raise a \"cry\" that may be heard far and wide - a cry that shall be a \"shout\" of rejoicing. The wool translated \"inhabitant\" is feminine, and designates the entire community or Church that dwells on the holy hill. For great is the Holy One of Israel in the midst of thee. The crowning glory of the Church is the presence of her Lord in the midst of her a presence continuous (\"I am with you always\"), efficacious (John 15:4-6), yet invisible (1 Peter 1:8). The Church is ever to proclaim this presence and rejoice in it.NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINE","Isa.13":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah13:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe burden of Babylon, which Isaiah the son of Amoz did see.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah13:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTLift ye up a banner upon the high mountain, exalt the voice unto them, shake the hand, that they may go into the gates of the nobles.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 2. - Lift ye up a banner; rather, a standard - \"an ensign,\" as in Isaiah 5:26: 11:12. \"Ensigns\" were used both by the Assyrians and the Egyptians. \"Banners,\" or flags, do not seem to have been employed in the ancient world. Upon the high mountain; rather, upon a bare mountain - one that was clear of trees, so that the signal might be the better seen from it. God's army having to be summoned against Babylon, the summons is made in three ways:NEWLINENEWLINE(1) by a signal or ensign lifted up on a high hill;NEWLINENEWLINE(2) by a loud call or shout; andNEWLINENEWLINE(3) by waving or beckoning with the hand.NEWLINENEWLINEThe whole description is, of course, pure metaphor.

The pronoun \"I\" is emphatic - \"I myself.\" Not only will an external summons go forth, but God will lay his own orders on them whom he chooses for his instruments, and bid them come to the muster. All who carry out his purposes are, in a certain sense, \"sanctified ones\" (comp. Jeremiah 22:7; Jeremiah 51:27; Zephaniah 1:7, etc.). Here the Modes and Persians are specially in. tended (see ver. 17). For mine anger; i.e. \"for the purpose of executing my anger.\" Even them that rejoice in my highness; rather, my proudly exultant ones (Cheyne, Rosenmüller, Gesenius). AEschylus calls the Persians ὑπερκόμπους ('Persae,' 1. 827); Herodotus, ὑβριστάς (1. 41). The high spirits, however, natural to gallant soldiers on going out to war, rather than any special haughtiness or arrogancy, are intended.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah13:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe noise of a multitude in the mountains, like as of a great people; a tumultuous noise of the kingdoms of nations gathered together: the LORD of hosts mustereth the host of the battle.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 4. - The noise of a multitude in the mountains. I do not know why Isaiah should not have been \"thinking of his geography\" (Cheyne). As soon as the Greeks knew anything of the Persians, they knew of them as a mountain people, and attributed their valor and their handy habits to the physical character of their country (Herod., 9. ad fin.). Jeremiah connects the invading army which destroyed Babylon with mountains, when he derives it from. Ararat (comp. Genesis 8:4), Minni (Armenia), and Ashchenaz (Jeremiah 51:27). At any rate, the mention of \"mountains\" here is very appropriate, both Media and Persia being, in the main, mountainous countries. A great people; or, much people - not necessarily of one nation only. The host of the battle; rather, a host of war; i.e. a multitude of men, armed and prepared for war.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah13:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThey come from a far country, from the end of heaven, even the LORD, and the weapons of his indignation, to destroy the whole land.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 5. - They come from a far country (comp. Isaiah 46:11). Both Media and Persia were \"far countries\" to the Hebrews, Persia especially. There is no indication that they knew of any countries more remote towards the East. Hence the expression which follows, \"from the end of heaven\" - the heaven being supposed to end where the earth ended. Isaiah, like the other sacred writers, conforms his language on cosmical subjects to the opinions of his day. Even the Lord. With a most effective anthropomorphism, Jehovah is made to march with the army that he has mustered (ver. 4) against the land that has provoked his wrath - i.e. Babylonia. The weapons (comp. Isaiah 10:15; Jeremiah 1:25; 51:20). To destroy the whole land. Many critics would render ha-arets by \"the earth\" here. It may be granted that the language of the prophecy goes beyond the occasion in places (especially vers. 11 and 13), and passes from Babylon to that wicked world of which Babylon is a type; but, where the context permits, it seems better to restrict than to expand the meaning of the words employed.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah13:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHowl ye; for the day of the LORD is at hand; it shall come as a destruction from the Almighty.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 6. - Howl ye; for the day of the Lord is at hand (comp. Joel 1:15); literally, the expression used in both passages is a day of Jehovah. The idiom would not, however, allow the use of the article, so that the phrase is ambiguous. \"The day of Jehovah\" is properly \"that crisis in the history of the world when Jehovah will interpose to rectify the evils of the present, bringing joy and glory to the humble believer, and misery and shame to the proud and disobedient\" (Cheyne). But any great occasion when God passes judgment on a nation is called in Scripture \"a day of the Lord.\" \"a coming of Christ.\" And so here the day of the judgment upon Babylon seems to be intended. It shall come as a destruction from the Almighty. Isaiah is thought to quote from Joel (Joel 1:15) here; but perhaps both prophets quoted from an earlier author. Shaddai (equivalent to \"Almighty') is an ancient name of God, most rarely used by the prophetical writers (only here, and in Ezekiel 1:24; Ezekiel 10:5; Joel 1:15), and never elsewhere by either Isaiah or Joel. It has generally been said to mean \"the Strong One;\" but recently the theory has found favor that it meant originally \"the Sender of storms,\" from the Arabic sh'da - jecit, effudit. However this may be, the word is certainly used in the later times mainly to express God's power to visit and punish, and the present passage might perhaps be best translated, \"It shall come as a destruction from the Destroyer (k'shod mish-Shaddai yabo).\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah13:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTTherefore shall all hands be faint, and every man's heart shall melt:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 7. - Therefore shall all hands be faint (comp. Jeremiah 1:43; Ezekiel 7:17; Zephaniah 3:16). There shall be a general inaction and apathy. Recently discovered accounts of the capture of Babylon by Cyrus show a great want of activity and vigor on the part of the defenders. Every man's heart shall melt (comp. Deuteronomy 20:8; Joshua 2:11; Joshua 5:1, etc.). The general inaction will spring from a general despondency. This statement agrees much better with the recently discovered documents than does the statement of Herodotus, that, safe within their walls, the Babylonians despised their assailants, and regarded themselves as perfectly secure.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah13:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd they shall be afraid: pangs and sorrows shall take hold of them; they shall be in pain as a woman that travaileth: they shall be amazed one at another; their faces shall be as flames.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 8. - They shall be afraid; rather, dismayed. Pangs and sorrows shall take hold of them; literally, they shall take hold of pangs and sorrows. They shall be amazed; rather, look aghast. Their faces shall be as flames. I know no better explanation than that of Dr. Kay, that a sudden transition is intended flora despondency to extreme excitement.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah13:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBehold, the day of the LORD cometh, cruel both with wrath and fierce anger, to lay the land desolate: and he shall destroy the sinners thereof out of it.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 9. - The day of the Lord (see the comment on ver. 6). Cruel; i.e. severe and painful, not really \"cruel.\" To lay the land desolate. As in ver. 5, so here, many would translate ha-arets by \"the earth,\" and understand a desolation extending far beyond Babylonia. But this is not necessary.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah13:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor the stars of heaven and the constellations thereof shall not give their light: the sun shall be darkened in his going forth, and the moon shall not cause her light to shine.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 10. - The stars of heaven... shall not give their light. Nature sympathizes with her Lord. When he is angry, the light of the heavens grows dark. So it was at the crucifixion of Christ (Matthew 27:45); so it will be at the end of the world (Matthew 24:29). So it is often, if not always, at the time of great judgments. The constellations; literally, the Orions. Kesil, the Fool, was the Hebrew name of the constellation of Orion, who was identified with Nimrod, the type of that impious folly which contends against God. From its application to this particular group of stars (Job 9:9; Job 38:31; Amos 5:8), the word came to be applied to constellations in general. The Baby-Ionians very early marked out the sky into constellations.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah13:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd I will punish the world for their evil, and the wicked for their iniquity; and I will cause the arrogancy of the proud to cease, and will lay low the haughtiness of the terrible.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 11. - I will punish the world for their evil. Here the prophecy certainly goes beyond the destruction of Babylon, and becomes a general warning to the wicked of all court-tries. Each country is to feel that its turn will come. Punishment will fall especially on the unjust, the proud, and the haughty (comp. Isaiah 1:28; Isaiah 2:11-17, etc.).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah13:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTI will make a man more precious than fine gold; even a man than the golden wedge of Ophir.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 12. - I will make a man more precious than fine gold (comp. Isaiah 4:1). Population shall he so diminished that man shall be the most highly esteemed of commodities. The more scanty the supply of a thing, the greater its value. The golden wedge of Ophir; rather, pure gold of Ophir. Ophir is mentioned as a gold-region in 1 Kings 9:28; 1 Kings 10:11; 1 Kings 22:48; 1 Chronicles 29:4; 2 Chronicles 8:18; 2 Chronicles 9:10; Job 22:24; Job 28:16; Psalm 45:9. Its locality is uncertain. Gold of Ophir appears to have been considered especially pure.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah13:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTTherefore I will shake the heavens, and the earth shall remove out of her place, in the wrath of the LORD of hosts, and in the day of his fierce anger.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 13. - I will shake the heavens (comp. Joel 3:16; Haggai 2:7; Matthew 24:29). In general, this sign is mentioned in connection with the end of the world, when a \"new heaven and a new earth\" are to supersede the old (Isaiah 65:17; Isaiah 66:22; Revelation 21:1). Isaiah may, perhaps, pass here from signs connected with the fall of Babylon to those which will announce the last (lay - each \"day of the Lord\" being, as already observed, a type of the final and great day (see the comment on ver. 6). Or, possibly, the allusion may be to some \"shaking\" by God of a supra-mundane kingdom as preliminary to his passing judgment on Babylon (so Dr. Kay; comp. Isaiah 24:21).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah13:14VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd it shall be as the chased roe, and as a sheep that no man taketh up: they shall every man turn to his own people, and flee every one into his own land.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 14. - It shall be as the chased roe. When the visitation comes on Babylon, there shall be a loosening of all ties between her and the subject nations. Her armies shall disband themselves, the pressed soldiers from foreign countries deserting, and hastening with all speed to their several homes. A flight of the foreign traders and visitors may also be glanced at. As a sheep that no man taketh up; rather, as sheep with none to gather them.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah13:15VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTEvery one that is found shall be thrust through; and every one that is joined unto them shall fall by the sword.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 15. - Every one that is found... every one that is joined unto them; i.e. all the population, both native and foreign.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah13:16VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTTheir children also shall be dashed to pieces before their eyes; their houses shall be spoiled, and their wives ravished.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 16. - Their children also shall be dashed to pieces. In the barbarous warfare of the time, even children were not spared (see Psalm 137:9; Nahum 3:10; Hosea 13:16). When a town was taken by assault, they were ruthlessly slaughtered. When spared, it was only to be dragged off as captives, and to become the slaves of their captors in a foreign land. Assyrian sculptures often illustrate this latter practice. Their wives ravished (comp. Lamentations 5:11; Zechariah 14:2).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah13:17VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBehold, I will stir up the Medes against them, which shall not regard silver; and as for gold, they shall not delight in it.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 17. - Behold, I will stir up the Medes against them. Isaiah's knowledge that the Medes should take a leading part in the destruction of Babylon is, no doubt, as surprising a fact as almost any other in the entire range of prophetic foresight, or insight, as set before us in Scripture. The Medes were known to Moses as an ancient nation of some importance (Genesis 10:2); but since his time had been unmentioned by any sacred writer; and, as a living nation, had only just come within the range of Israelite vision, by the fact that, when Sargon deported the Samaritans from Samaria, he placed some of them \"in the cities of the Medes\" (2 Kings 17:6). The Assyrians had become acquainted with them somewhat more than a century earlier, and had made frequent incursions into their country, finding them a weak and divided people, under the government of a large number of petty chiefs. Sargon had conquered a portion of the tribes, and placed prefects in the cities; at the same time planting colonists in them from other parts of the empire. That, when the weakness of Media was being thus made apparent, Isaiah should have foreseen its coming greatness can only be accounted for by his having received a Divine communication on the subject. Subsequently, he had a still more exact and complete communication (Isaiah 21:2). Which shall not regard silver. The Medes were not a particularly disinterested people; but in the attack on Babylon, made by Cyrus, the object was not plunder, but conquest and the extension of dominion. The main treasures of Babylon - those in the great temple of Bolus - were not carried off by Cyrus, as appears both from his own inscriptions, and from Herodotus (1. 181-183).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah13:18VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTTheir bows also shall dash the young men to pieces; and they shall have no pity on the fruit of the womb; their eye shall not spare children.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 18. - Their bows (comp. Jeremiah 1:9, 14). Both the Medes and the Persians were skilled archers. Herodotus tells us that every Persian youth was taught three things - \"to ride, to draw the bow, and to speak the truth\" (1. 136). At Persepolis, Modes and Persians are alike represented as carrying bows and quivers. AEschyius regards the contest between the Persians and the Greeks as one between the arrow and the spear ('Persae,' 11. 135, 136).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah13:19VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Babylon, the glory of kingdoms, the beauty of the Chaldees' excellency, shall be as when God overthrew Sodom and Gomorrah.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 19. - Babylon, the glory of kingdoms. The \"glory\" of Babylon consisted:NEWLINENEWLINE1. In her antiquity. She had been the head of a great empire long before Assyria rose to power.NEWLINENEWLINE2. In her origination of literature, architecture, and the other arts, which all passed from her to Assyria, and thence to the other nations of Asia.NEWLINENEWLINE3. In her magnificence and the magnificence of her kings, which provoked the admiration of the Assyrians themselves ('Records of the Past,' vol. 9. p. 15). As time went on, she grew in wealth and splendor. Perhaps it was granted to Isaiah to see her in ecstatic vision, not merely such as she was in the time of Sargon under Merodach-Baladan, but such as she became under Nebuchadnezzar, the greatest of her kings, who raised her to the highest pitch or glory and eminence. The beauty of the Chaldees' excellency. The Kaldi appear to have been originally one of the many tribes by which Babylonia was peopled at an early date, From the expression, \"Ur of the Chaldees,\" which occurs more than once in Genesis (Genesis 11:28, 31), we may gather that they were inhabitants of the more southern part of the country, near the coast. The same conclusion may be drawn from the Assyrian inscriptions, especially those of Shalmaneser II. - the Black Obelisk king. The term never became a general name for the Babylonian people among themselves or among the Assyrians; but, somehow-or other, it was accepted in that sense by the Jews, and is so used, not only by Isaiah, but also by the writers of Kings and Chronicles, by Jeremiah, Ezekiel, Daniel, and Habakkuk. As when God overthrew Sodom. Equally sudden and complete as that destruction.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah13:20VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTIt shall never be inhabited, neither shall it be dwelt in from generation to generation: neither shall the Arabian pitch tent there; neither shall the shepherds make their fold there.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 20. - It shall never be inhabited. This part of the prophecy did not receive its fulfillment till many centuries had gone by. From the time of Cyrus to that of Alexander the Great, Babylon was one of the chief cities of the Persian empire. Alexander was so struck with it, and with the excellence of its situation, that he designed to make it his capital. It first began seriously to decline under the Seleucidae, who built Seleucia on the Tigris as a rival to it, and still further injured it by fixing the seat of government at Antioch. But it had still a large population in the first century after our era (Josephus, 'Ant. Jud.,' 18:9, § 8); and is mentioned as a place of some consequence in the time of Trajan (Die Cass., 68:27), and even in that of Severue (Die Cass., 75:9). But after this it went rapidly to decay. Under the Sassuntans it disappears from sight; and when Benjamin of Tudela, in the twelfth century, visited the spot, there was nothing to be seen of the mighty city but those ruins of the Kasr, or palace, which still arrest the traveler's attention. The site had become, and has ever since remained, \"without inhabitant.\" Neither shall the Arabian pitch tent there. A superstitious feeling prevents the Arabs from encamping on the mounds of Babylon, which are believed to be the haunts of evil spirits (Rich, 'First Memoir on Babylon,' p. 67; Ker Porter, 'Travels,' vol. 2. p. 371). Neither shall the shepherds make their fold there. The nitrous soil of the Babylonian mounds allows them to produce nothing but the coarsest and most unpalatable vegetation. The shepherds consequently do not feed their flocks on them.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah13:21VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut wild beasts of the desert shall lie there; and their houses shall be full of doleful creatures; and owls shall dwell there, and satyrs shall dance there.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 21. - Wild beasts of the desert shall lie there. It is not quite clear what particular wild beasts are intended. Those actually noted on the site of Babylon are lions, jackals, and porcupines. These sometimes make their lairs in the ruins (Rich, 'First Memoir,' p. 69; Ker Porter, 'Travels,' vol. 2. p. 342). Doleful creatures; in the original, okhim. What animal is meant we cannot say, as the word occurs only in this passage. Mr. Cheyne translates it by \"hyenas.\" Owls shall dwell there; literally, daughters of the owl (as in Leviticus 11:16; Deuteronomy 14:15; Job 30:29; Jeremiah 50:39; Micah 1:8; and infra, Isaiah 34:13; Isaiah 43:20). Mr. Rich says, \"In most of the cavities of the Babil Mound there are numbers of owls and bats.\" Sir A. Layard,\" A large grey owl is found in great numbers, frequently in flocks of nearly a hundred, in the low shrubs among the ruins of Babylon\" ('Nin. and Bab.,' p. 484, note). Satyrs shall dance there. The word translated \"satyr\" is, etymologically, \"hairy one,\" and ordinarily means \"a goat.\" Some have supposed \"wild goats\" to be here intended, but they are not found in Babylonia. The translation \"satyr\" is defended by many, who think Isaiah might draw upon current beliefs for some features of his description. Dr. Kay gives \"baboons,\" since the Moko - a kind of baboon - is known in Babylonia.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah13:22VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the wild beasts of the islands shall cry in their desolate houses, and dragons in their pleasant palaces: and her time is near to come, and her days shall not be prolonged.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 22. - Wild beasts of the islands. In the Hebrew, iyyim, which means \"wailers\" or \"howlers,\" probably \"jackals.\" The Revised Version gives \"wolves.\" In their desolate houses; or, in their castles (Cheyne). And dragons; i.e. \"serpents.\" These have not been observed recently; but one of our old travelers notes that \"the lande of Baby-lone,\" in his day, \"was fulle of dragons and grote serpentes, and dyverse other veney-mouse ecstes alle abouten\" (Mandeville, quoted by Ker Porter, 'Travels,' vol. 2. p. 36). Near to come. About one hundred and eighty years elapsed between the utterance of this prophecy and the fall of Babylon - a short period in the lifetime of a nation.NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINE","Isa.14":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah14:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor the LORD will have mercy on Jacob, and will yet choose Israel, and set them in their own land: and the strangers shall be joined with them, and they shall cleave to the house of Jacob.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 1-23. - THE RESTORATION OF ISRAEL, AND HER SONG OF TRIUMPH OVER BABYLON. The destruction of Babylon is to be followed by the restoration of Israel, with the good will of the nations, and by their exercising rule over their late oppressors (vers. 1, 2). In this time of rest and refreshment they will sing a song of triumph over Babylon. The song extends from ver. 4 to ver. 23. It consists of five stanzas, or strophes, each comprising seven long lines, after which there is a brief epode, or epilogue, of a different character. This epode is comprised in vers. 22 and 23. Verse 1. - For the Lord will have mercy on Jacob. God's purpose of mercy upon Israel requires, as its preliminary, the destruction of Babylon, and may be considered as the final cause of that destruction. His desire to have mercy on Israel soon is the reason why the days of Babylon are not prolonged (see Isaiah 13:22). Will yet choose Israel. The Captivity was a rejection of Israel from their position as a favored race - God's peculiar people; their restoration was a fresh \"choice\" of them out of all the nations of the world, a free act of grace on his part; to which they had no claim or right whatsoever. And set them in their own land; or, on their own ground. The land that once was theirs, but which they had forfeited by their disobedience, could only become \"their own\" again by a fresh gift from God. The strangers shall be joined with them; rather, the stranger shall join himself to them. On the return from the Captivity, there would be an influx of proselytes from the nations, who would voluntarily join themselves to those whom they saw favored both by God and man (comp. Esther 8:17). Though the Jews did not commonly seek proselytes, they readily received such as offered themselves. A further fulfillment of the prophecy took place when the Gentiles flocked into the Church of God after the coming of Christ.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah14:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the people shall take them, and bring them to their place: and the house of Israel shall possess them in the land of the LORD for servants and handmaids: and they shall take them captives, whose captives they were; and they shall rule over their oppressors.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 2. - And the people shall take them; rather, peoples shall take them. The heathen nations among whom they have dwelt shall rejoice at the restoration of Israel to their own land, and even escort them in a friendly spirit to their borders (comp. Ezra 1:4, 6; Nehemiah 2:7-9). Some shall go so far as voluntarily to become their bondservants in Palestine. They shall take them captive, whose captives they were. This can scarcely have been intended literally. The Jews were at no time a conquering people, nor one that set itself to \"take captives.\" The true meaning is that Jewish ideas shall penetrate and subdue the nations generally, and among them those with whom Israel had dwelt as captives. The Jews did become very powerful and numerous both in Assyria and Babylonia about the first century after Christ, and Christian Churches were early formed in Mesopotamia, Adiabene, and even Babylon.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah14:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd it shall come to pass in the day that the LORD shall give thee rest from thy sorrow, and from thy fear, and from the hard bondage wherein thou wast made to serve,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 3. - The hard bondage wherein thou wast made to serve (comp. Isaiah 47:6). We have no detailed account of the Babylonian, as we have of the Egyptian, servitude; but it was probably well-nigh as grievous. A few, of royal descent, might be eunuchs in the palace of the great king (2 Kings 20:18; Daniel 1:3), and hold offices of trust; but with the bulk of the nation it was otherwise. Psalm 137, has the plaintive ring which marks it as the utterance of a sorely oppressed people. And there are passages of Ezekiel which point in the same direction (see especially Ezekiel 34:27-29).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah14:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThat thou shalt take up this proverb against the king of Babylon, and say, How hath the oppressor ceased! the golden city ceased!VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 4. - Thou shalt take up this proverb; rather, this parable, as the word is translated in Numbers 23, and 24; in Job 26:1; Job 29:1; Psalm 49:4; Psalm 78:2; Ezekiel 17:2; Ezekiel 20:49; Ezekiel 21:5; Ezekiel 24:3; Micah 2:4; Habakkuk 2:6; or \"this taunting speech,\" as our translators render in the margin (see Cheyne, ad loc.; and comp. Hebrews 2:6). The golden city. There are two readings here - mad-hebah and marhebah. The latter reading was preferred anciently, and is followed by the LXX., the Syriac and Chaldee Versions, the Targums, Ewald, Gesenius, and Mr. Cheyne. It would give the meaning of\" the raging one.\" Madhebah, however, is preferred by Rosenmüller, Vitringa, and Dr. Kay. It is supposed to mean \"golden,\" from d'hab, the Chaldee form of the Hebrew zahob, gold. But the question is pertinent - Why should a Chaldee form have been used by a Hebrew writer ignorant of Chaldee and Chaldea?NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah14:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe LORD hath broken the staff of the wicked, and the sceptre of the rulers.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 5. - The staff... the scepter.

The participle translated \"he who smote\" refers to \"staff\" or \"scepter.\" With a continual stroke; i.e. incessantly, one war following another without pause or stop. He that ruled, etc.; rather, which ruled the nations in anger with a persecution that held not back.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah14:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe whole earth is at rest, and is quiet: they break forth into singing.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 7. - At rest... singing. The first result of the fall of Babylon is general peace, rest, and quiet; then the nations, recognizing the blessedness of the change, burst out into a song of rejoicing. The peace did not really continue very long; for Persia took up the role of conqueror which Babylon had been forced to drop, and, under Cambyses and Darius Hystaspis, produced as much stir and disturbance as had been caused by Babylon., Still, there was an interval of about eleven years between the conquest of Babylon by Cyrus ( B.C. 538), and the expedition by Cambyses against Egypt ( B.C. 527).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah14:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTYea, the fir trees rejoice at thee, and the cedars of Lebanon, saying, Since thou art laid down, no feller is come up against us.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 8. - Fir trees...cedars. We may detect a double meaning here - one literal, the other metaphorical. Literally, the trees of Lebanon and the other mountain ranges would be spared, since, while both the Assyrian and Babylonian kings cut timber in the Syrian forests for building purposes, the Persians had no such practice; metaphorically, the firs and cedars are the kings and nobles of the countries (comp. Ezekiel 31:16), who likewise had a respite. Since thou art laid down; rather, since thou liest low. The first stanza here ends, and the second begins with the next verse.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah14:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHell from beneath is moved for thee to meet thee at thy coming: it stirreth up the dead for thee, even all the chief ones of the earth; it hath raised up from their thrones all the kings of the nations.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 9. - Hell from beneath. The Hebrew Sheol corresponded nearly to the Greek Hades, and the Latin Inferi. It was a dismal region in the center of the earth, whither departed souls descended, and where they remained thenceforth. There were various depths in it, each apparently more dismal than the preceding; but there is no evidence that it was considered to contain any place of happiness, until after the return from the Captivity. The prophet here represents Sheol as disturbed by the advent of the Babylonian monarch, and as rousing itself to receive him. The great ones of the earth, and the kings, who are kings even in Hades, and sit upon thrones, are especially moved by the occasion, and prepare to meet and greet their brother. Personal identity and continued consciousness of it after death are assumed; and the former earthly rank of the inmates seems to be recognized and maintained. It stirreth up the dead. Hell in the aggregate - the place personified - proceeds to arouse the individual inmates, who are called re-phaim - the word commonly translated \"giants\" (Deuteronomy 2:11, 20; Deuteronomy 13:12; Joshua 12:4; Joshua 13:12, etc.), but meaning properly \"feeble ones.\" The shades or ghosts of the departed were regarded as weak and nerveless, in comparison with living men (compare the Homeric εἴδωλα καμόντων). All the chief ones; literally, the he-goats (comp. Jeremiah 1:8; Jeremiah 51:40; Zechariah 10:3). Raised up from their thrones; i.e. \"caused to rise up from their thrones,\" and stand in eager expectation of what was about to happen.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah14:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAll they shall speak and say unto thee, Art thou also become weak as we? art thou become like unto us?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 10. - Art thou also become weak as we? rather, So thou also art made weak as we! (On the supposed weakness of the dead, see the comment on ver. 9.)NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah14:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThy pomp is brought down to the grave, and the noise of thy viols: the worm is spread under thee, and the worms cover thee.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 11. - The noise of thy viols. (On the fondness of the Babylonians for music, and the number and variety of their musical instruments, see Daniel 3:7, 10, etc.) The word here translated \"viol\" is more commonly rendered \"psaltery.\" (On the probable character of the instrument intended, see note on Isaiah 5:12.) The worm is spread under thee, etc.; rather, beneath thee is spread the maggot, and the worm covereth thee. The thought of the grave brings the thought of corruption with it. For cushion and for coverlet the royal corpse has only the loathsome creatures which come with putrescence. At this point the second stanza terminates.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah14:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHow art thou fallen from heaven, O Lucifer, son of the morning! how art thou cut down to the ground, which didst weaken the nations!VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 12. - How art thou fallen from heaven, O Lucifer! Babylon's sudden fall is compared, with great force and beauty, to the (seeming) fall of a star from heaven. The word translated \"Lucifer\" means properly \"shining one,\" and no doubt here designates a star; but whether any particular star or no is uncertain. The LXX. translated by ἑωσφόρος, whence our \"Lucifer.\" The subjoined epithet, \"son of the morning\" or \"of the dawn,\" accords well with this rendering. How art thou cut down to the ground! One of Isaiah's favorite changes of metaphor. It is a favorite metaphor also to which he reverts - that of representing the destruction of a nation by the felling of a tree or of a forest (comp. Isaiah 2:12, 13; Isaiah 10:33, 34, etc.). Which didst weaken the nations; rather, which didst prostrate the nations. The word used is one of great force (comp. Exodus 17:13; Job 14:10).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah14:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor thou hast said in thine heart, I will ascend into heaven, I will exalt my throne above the stars of God: I will sit also upon the mount of the congregation, in the sides of the north:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 13. - For thou hast said; rather, and thou - thou saidst; i.e. weak as thou art now shown to have been, it was thou that didst dare to say. I will ascend into heaven, etc. (comp. Isaiah 10:13, 14; Isaiah 37:24, 25). Isaiah represents rather the thoughts of the Babylonian monarch than his actual words. The Babylonian inscriptions are full of boasting egotism; but they do not contain anything approaching to impiety. The king may regard himself as, in a certain sense, Divine; but still he entertains a deep respect and reverence for those gods whom he regards as the most exalted, as Merodach, Bel, Nebo, Sin, Shamas. He is their worshipper, their devotee, their suppliant (see 'Records of the Past,' vol. 5. pp. 111-148). The Babylonian monarchs may have believed that after death they would mount up to heaven and join the \"assembly of the great gods\" (ibid., vol. 3. p. 83); but we scarcely know enough as yet of the religions opinions of the Babylonians to state positively what their belief was on the subject of a future life. I will sit also upon the mount of the congregation. The early commentators explained this of Mount Zion, especially on account of the phrase, \"in the sides of the north,\" which is used of the temple-bill in Psalm 48:2. But it is well objected that Mount Zion was a place of no grandeur or dignity or holiness to the Babylonians, who had made it a desolation; and that no Babylonian monarch would have desired to \"sit\" there. Moreover, the \"mountain\" of this passage must be one which is \"above the heights of the clouds\" and \"above the stars of God,\" which the most imaginative poet could not have said of Mount Zion. A mythic mountain, belonging to the Babylonian theosophy, was therefore seen to be intended, even before the times of cuneiform decipherment (Rosenmüller, Michaelis, Knobel). Now that the Babylonian inscriptions can be read, it is found that there was such a mountain, called \"Im-Kharsak,\" or \"Kharsak-Kurra,\" which is described as \"the mighty mountain of Bel, whose head rivals heaven, whose root is the holy deep,\" and which \"was regarded as the spot where the ark had rested, and where the gods had their seat\" ('Records of the Past,' vol. 11. p. 131, with the comment of Mr. Sayce, p. 130). In Babylonian geography this mountain was identified, either with the peak of Rowandiz, or with Mount Elwend, near Ecbatana. In the sides of the north. Both El-wend and Rowandiz are situated to the northeast of Babylou - a position which, according to ancient ideas, might be described indifferently as \"north\" or \"east.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah14:14VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTI will ascend above the heights of the clouds; I will be like the most High.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 14. - I will be like the Most High (comp. Isaiah 47:8). It is a mistake to say that \"the Assyrians gave the name of God to their monarchs\" (Kay), or, at any rate, there is no evidence that they did. Nor does any king, either Assyrian or Babylonian, ever assume a Divine title. There is a marked difference in this respect between the Egyptian and the Assyro-Babylonian religions. Probably Isaiah only means that Babylonian monarchs thought of themselves as gods, worked their own wills, were wrapped up in themselves, did not in heart bow down to a higher Power.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah14:15VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTYet thou shalt be brought down to hell, to the sides of the pit.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 15. - Thou shalt be brought down; rather, thou art brought down (comp. vers. 9-11). The sides of the pit; or, the recesses - the \"lowest parts\" of the pit. With those words the third stanza terminates.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah14:16VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThey that see thee shall narrowly look upon thee, and consider thee, saying, Is this the man that made the earth to tremble, that did shake kingdoms;VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 16. - They that see thee. Dr. Kay well observes that \"here the scene of the parable is changed back to earth. The corpse of the mighty conqueror is lying unburied.\" Shall narrowly look upon thee. Like the inhabitants of hell (ver. 10), those of earth also shall scarcely believe their eyes. They shall look close to see if it is indeed the great king that is slain.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah14:17VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThat made the world as a wilderness, and destroyed the cities thereof; that opened not the house of his prisoners?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 17. - That opened not the house of his prisoners; literally, that loosed not his prisoners homewards. The long imprisonment of Jehoiachin by Nebuchadnezzar (thirty-six years, 2 Kings 25:27) is an illustration; but perhaps it is rather the retention in captivity of the entire Jewish people that is brought to the prophet's cognizance.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah14:18VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAll the kings of the nations, even all of them, lie in glory, every one in his own house.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 18. - All the kings of the nations, etc.; i.e. the other kings, speaking generally, died in peace, and had an honorable burial, each one in the sepulcher that he had prepared for himself as his final abode or \"house\" (comp. Isaiah 22:16). The care taken to prepare tombs was not confined to Egypt, though there obtaining its greatest development. Among others, the Persian kings certainly prepared their own sepulchers; and probably the practice was general.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah14:19VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut thou art cast out of thy grave like an abominable branch, and as the raiment of those that are slain, thrust through with a sword, that go down to the stones of the pit; as a carcase trodden under feet.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 19. - But thou art cast out (see ver. 13). Again \"thou\" is emphatic. Translate, But thou - thou art cast out. The Babylonian monarch did not rest in the tomb which he had prepared for himself. His body was \"cast out\" - left, apparently, where it fell in battle. If there is allusion to any individual, it is probably to Belshazzar (Daniel 5:30). Like an abominable branch. As a shoot from a tree, which is disapproved, and so condemned and cut away. As the raiment of those that are slam. The garments of the slain, soaked in blood (Isaiah 9:5), were useless, and were consequently flung away or left to rot uncured for. So was it with the corpse of the great king. That go down to the stones of the pit. This clause is thought to be misplaced. It deranges the meter and damages the sense. Corpses were not interred on fields of battle in the East (Herod., 3:26). They were left to be \"trodden underfoot.\" It is best, with Ewald and Mr. Cheyne, to transfer the clause to the commencement of the next verse. Thus the fourth stanza is relieved, and the fifth properly filled out.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah14:20VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThou shalt not be joined with them in burial, because thou hast destroyed thy land, and slain thy people: the seed of evildoers shall never be renowned.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 20. - If we make the alteration suggested in the preceding note, this verse will begin as follows: \"They that have gone down to the stoner of the pit, with these thou shalt not be joined in burial\" - a repetition certainly of the first clause of ver. 19, but with amplification, and with the reason appended. Thou hast destroyed thy land; i.e. \"brought ruin on it by displeasing God, and causing him to visit it with a judgment.\" The seed of evil-doers shall never be renowned; rather, shall not be named forever (comp. Psalm 109:13). The meaning is that they shall have no seed, or, if they have any, that it shall be early cut off, and the whole race blotted out. Pretenders rose up under Darius Hystaspis, claiming descent from Belshazzar's father, Nabenidus; but the claim is characterized as false, and a false claim would scarcely have been set up had real descendants survived.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah14:21VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTPrepare slaughter for his children for the iniquity of their fathers; that they do not rise, nor possess the land, nor fill the face of the world with cities.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 21. - Prepare slaughter for his children. Belshazzar had \"wives and concubines\" (Daniel 5:2), and therefore probably children. The magnanimity of Cyrus may have spared them; but neither Cambyses nor Darius Hystaspis had the same merciful disposition. As soon as there was seen to be danger of Babylon revolting, they would almost certainly be put to death. For the iniquity of their fathers (comp. Exodus 20:5). The destruction of their posterity was a part of the punishment of the fathers. That they do not rise; i.e. \"that they do not recover themselves and become great monarchs once more, and once more build great cities, \"such as those which they were famous for Babel, Erech, Accad, Calneh, Ur, Sepharvaim, Borsippa, Opts, Teredon, etc. It was as city-builders that the Babylonians were especially celebrated (Genesis 10:10; Daniel 4:30; Herod., 1:178, etc.).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah14:22VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor I will rise up against them, saith the LORD of hosts, and cut off from Babylon the name, and remnant, and son, and nephew, saith the LORD.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 22, 23. - These verses constitute the epode of the poem. Their main object is to make it clear that the punishment about in fall on Babylon comes from none other than Jehovah, whose Name occurs twice in ver. 22, and emphatically closes ver. 23. The lines are much more irregular than those of the strophes, or stanzas. Verse 22. - And cut off from Babylon the name. It is not quite clear in what sense her \"name\" was to be \"cut off\" from Babylon. One of the main masses of ruin still bears the old name almost unchanged (Babil), and can scarcely be supposed to have lost it and afterwards recovered it. Perhaps \"name\" here means \"fame\" or \"celebrity\" (comp. Deuteronomy 26:19; Zephaniah 3:20). Son and nephew; rather, son and grandson, or issue and descendants. The same phrase occurs in the same sense in Genesis 21:23 and Job 18:19.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah14:23VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTI will also make it a possession for the bittern, and pools of water: and I will sweep it with the besom of destruction, saith the LORD of hosts.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 23. - A possession for the bittern. Some water-bird or other is probably intended, since the word used is joined in Isaiah 36:11 with the names of three other birds, and is also certainly a bird's name in Zephaniah 2:14; but the identification with the \"bittern\" is a mere guess, and rests on no authority. And pools of water. The swampy character of the country about the ruins of Babylon is generally noticed by travelers. It arises from neglect of the dams along the course of the Euphrates. Ker Porter says that \"large deposits of the Euphrates water are left stagnant in the hollows between the ruins\" ('Travels,' vol. 2. p. 389).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah14:24VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe LORD of hosts hath sworn, saying, Surely as I have thought, so shall it come to pass; and as I have purposed, so shall it stand:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 24-27. - A FURTHER PROPHECY OF DELIVERANCE FROM ASSYRIA. From the distant prospect of an ultimate deliverance from the power of Babylon, the prophet turns his gaze to a nearer, if not a greater, deliverance. The present enemy is Assyria. It is she who has carried Samaria into captivity, and who now threatens the independence of Judah. Deliverance from her has already been promised more than once (Isaiah 10:16-19, 25-27, 33, 34); but apparently the people are not reassured - they still dread the foe who is so near, and who seems so irresistible. God, therefore, condescends to give them a fresh prophecy, a fresh assurance, and to confirm it to them by an oath (ver. 24). The Assyrian power shall be broken - her yoke shall be cast off (ver. 25); God has declared his purpose, and nothing can hinder it (ver. 27). Verse 24. - Hath sworn. This is the emphatic word - the new thing in the prophecy. God but seldom declares his purposes with an oath - never but in condescension to the weakness of his creatures, who, though they misdoubt his word, can feel the immutability of an oath (Hebrews 6:17), and yield it the credence and the confidence which they refuse to a bare assertion. As I have thought... as I have purposed. A reference to the prophecies previously given in Isaiah 10. So shall it come to pass; literally, so it hath been - a striking instance of the \"preterite of prophetic certainty.\" So shall it stand; literally, as I have purposed, that shall stand.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah14:25VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThat I will break the Assyrian in my land, and upon my mountains tread him under foot: then shall his yoke depart from off them, and his burden depart from off their shoulders.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 25. - I will break the Assyrian in my land. This is referred by some critics to the miraculous destruction of Sennacherib's army, and regarded as a proof that the scene, of that destruction was Judaea. But it is possible that a disaster to the forces of Sargon may be intended (see the comment on Isaiah 10:28-32). His yoke shall depart from off them (comp. Isaiah 10:27). The Assyrian yoke, imposed by Tiglath-Pileser (2 Kings 16:7-10), and (according to his own inscriptions) again by Sargon, was thrown off by Hezekiah, who \"rebelled against the King of Assyria, and served him not\" (2 Kings 18:7). It was this rebellion that provoked the expedition of Sennacherib, described in 2 Kings 18:13-16; and it may be this rejection of the yoke which is here prophesied.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah14:26VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThis is the purpose that is purposed upon the whole earth: and this is the hand that is stretched out upon all the nations.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 26. - The whole earth... all the nations. Blows struck against Assyria or Babylonia affected all the then known nations Each, in its turn, was \"the hammer of the whole earth\" (Jeremiah 1:23), and a check received by either caused world-wide disturbance. No sooner did one subject nation recover her freedom, than an electric shock ran through all the rest - plots were laid, confederacies formed, revolts planned, embassies sent hither and thither. The complete destruction of Assyria involved a complete change in the relations, not only of the principal powers - Egypt, Assyria, Babylonia, Media, Elam, but even of the minor ones - Philistia, Edom, Moab, Syria, Phoenicia, Ammon.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah14:27VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor the LORD of hosts hath purposed, and who shall disannul it? and his hand is stretched out, and who shall turn it back?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 27. - His hand is stretched out; literally, his is the outstretched hand, which is more emphatic.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah14:28VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTIn the year that king Ahaz died was this burden.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 28-32. - THE BURDEN OF PHILISTIA. The Philistines had suffered grievously at the hands of Judah in the reign of Uzziah (2 Chronicles 26:6), and had retaliated in the reign of Ahaz (2 Chronicles 28:18). It would seem that after this they were invaded by Tiglath-Pileser, who penetrated as far as Gaza, which lie took ('Records of the Past,' vol. 5. p. 51) and made tributary, as he also did Ascalon ('Ancient Monarchies,' vol. it. p. 399). Tiglath-Pileser died shortly before Ahaz, and the present \"burden\" seems to have been uttered in connection with his death. Isaiah warns Philistia (equivalent to \"Palestina\") that her rejoicing is premature; Tiglath-Pileser will have successors as powerful and as cruel as himself, and these successors will carry destruction and ravage over the whole land. Verse 28. - In the year that King Ahaz died was this burden. These words introduce the \"burden of Philistia,\" and shows that it is chronologically out of place, since the prophecies from Isaiah 10. to Isaiah 14:1-27 have belonged to the reign of Hezekiah. Ahaz appears to have died early in B.C. 725.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah14:29VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTRejoice not thou, whole Palestina, because the rod of him that smote thee is broken: for out of the serpent's root shall come forth a cockatrice, and his fruit shall be a fiery flying serpent.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 29. - Whole Palestina. The Greeks called Philistia τὴν Παλαιστίνην Συρίαν, or \"Syria of the Philistines,\" whence the Latin \"Palestina\" and our \"Palestine.\" Isaiah addresses the country as \"whole Palestine,\" because, while it was made up of a number of principalities (1 Samuel 6:18), his message concerned it in its entirety. The rod of him that smote thee is broken. This can scarcely refer to the death of Ahaz, since Ahaz did not smite the Philistines, but was smitten by them (2 Chronicles 28:18). It may, however, refer to the death of Tiglath-Pileser, which took place only a year or two previously. Out of the serpent's root shall come forth a cockatrice; i.e. a more poisonous serpent (see note on Isaiah 11:8). Shal-maneser can scarcely be meant, since he does not, appear to have attacked the Philistines. Probably Sargon is intended, who \"took Ashdod\" (Isaiah 20:1), made Khanun, King of Gaza, prisoner ('Records of the Past,' vol. 9. p. 5), and reduced Philtstia generally to subjection. And his fruit shall be a fiery flying serpent. The fruit of the cockatrice will be even more terrible and venomous. He will resemble the \"fiery flying serpent\" of the wilderness (Numbers 21:6). Sennacherib is, perhaps, this \"fruit.\" He conquered Ascalon ('Ancient Monarchies,' vol. 2. p. 432) and Ekron (ibid., p. 433), and had the kings of Gaze and Ashdod among his tributaries (ibid., p. 438, note 11).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah14:30VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the firstborn of the poor shall feed, and the needy shall lie down in safety: and I will kill thy root with famine, and he shall slay thy remnant.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 30. - The firstborn of the poor shall feed. The \"firstborn of the poor\" are the very poor (Jarchi, Rosenmüller). The refer-once is to the poor Israelites, who will \"feed\" and \"lie down in safety\" when Philistia is held in subjection. I will kill thy root with famine, and he shall slay thy remnant. God kills with famine, man with the sword (see 2 Samuel 24:13, 14). When the Philistines had resisted behind their strong walls till hunger had done its work by thinning their ranks, the Assyrian conqueror would storm their strongholds and slaughter \"the remnant.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah14:31VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHowl, O gate; cry, O city; thou, whole Palestina, art dissolved: for there shall come from the north a smoke, and none shall be alone in his appointed times.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 31. - Howl, O gate; cry, O city. Each city of Philistia is hidden to howl and lament. All will suffer; not one will be spared. Art dissolved; literally, art melted; i.e. \"faintest through fear\" (comp. Joshua 2:9; Jeremiah 49:23). There shall come from the north a smoke. The \"smoke\" is the Assyrian host, which ravages the country as it advances, burning towns, and villages, and peasants' cots, and watchmen's towers. It enters the country \"from the north,\" as a matter of course, where it adjoins upon Judaea. The coast route, which led through the Plain of Sharon, was that commonly followed by Egyptian armies. None shall be alone in his appointed times; rather, there shall be no straggler at the rendezvous.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah14:32VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWhat shall one then answer the messengers of the nation?

What answer shall be made to the Philistine ambassadors, when they come to Jerusalem and entreat for aid? Simply this - that God has founded and will protect Zion, and that the poor and weak among God's people - whether Jews or Philistines - had better betake themselves to the shelter of the \"city of the great King.\"NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINE","Isa.15":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah15:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe burden of Moab. Because in the night Ar of Moab is laid waste, and brought to silence; because in the night Kir of Moab is laid waste, and brought to silence;VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 1-9. - THE BURDEN OF MOAB. The present chapter and the next are very closely connected, and may be regarded as together constituting \"the burden of Moab.\" It has been argued on critical grounds that the bulk of the prophecy is quoted by Isaiah from an earlier writer, and that he has merely modified the wording and added a few touches here and there (so Gesenius, Rosenmüller, Hitzig, Maurer, Ewald, Knobel, and Cheyne). Jeremiah is thought to have also based his \"judgment of Moab\" (Jeremiah 48.) on the same early writing. But speculations of this kind are in the highest degree uncertain, and moreover lead to no results of the slightest importance. It is best, therefore, to regard Isaiah as the author of these two chapters. Having threatened Philistia, Israel's nearest enemy upon the west, he turns to Moab, her nearest foe towards the east. Verse 1. - Because. An elliptical beginning. Mr. Cheyne supposes some such words as \"Lament for Moab,\" or \"Alas for Moab!\" to have been in the writer's mind, but to have been omitted through \"lyrical excitement.\" In the night. This is best taken literally. Night attacks, though not common in antiquity, were not unknown. Mesha, King of Moab, boasts that he \"went in the night\" against Nebo, and assaulted it at early dawn (Moabite Stone, I. 15). Ar of Moab; or, Ar-Moab. An ancient city, mentioned among those taken from the Moabites by Sihon (Numbers 21:28). According to Jerome, it was called in Roman times Areopolis, or Rabbath-Moab. Modern geographers identify it with Rabba, a place on the old Roman road between Kerak and Arair, south of the Amen, where there are some ancient remains, though they are not very extensive (Burckhardt, 'Travels,' p. 377). Is laid waste, and brought to silence; rather, is stormed, is ruined. Kir of Moab. \"Kir of Moab\" is reasonably identified with Kerak, a place very strongly situated on a mountain peak, about ten miles flora the south-eastern corner of the Dead Sea.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah15:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHe is gone up to Bajith, and to Dibon, the high places, to weep: Moab shall howl over Nebo, and over Medeba: on all their heads shall be baldness, and every beard cut off.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 2. - He is gone to Bajith; rather, he is gone to the temple. Probably the temple of Baal at Beth-baal-meon is intended. Beth-baal-meon is 'mentioned in close connection with Dibon in Joshua 13:17. And to Dibon. Diboa is mentioned in Numbers 21:30; Numbers 32:3, 34; Joshua 13:9, 17; Jeremiah 48:18, 22. It was an ancient Moabite town of considerable importance, and has recently been identified with the site called Diban, where the Moabite Stone was found. This place is situated in the country east of the Dead Sea, about three miles north of the river Arnon, on the old Roman road connecting Rabbath-Moab with Hesh-bob. The town seems to have gained in importance from the fact that it was the birthplace of Chemosh-Gad, Mesha's father (Moabite Stone, 1. 2). Mesha added to its territory (ibid., 1.21). It is extremely probable that it was the site of one of the Moabite \"high places,\" and was therefore naturally one of the places whereto the Moabites, when afflicted, went up\" to weep.\" Over Nebo, and over Medeba. Nebe and Medeba were also ancient Moabite towns. Nebo is mentioned in Numbers 32:3, 38; Numbers 33:47; 1 Chronicles 5:8; Jeremiah 48:1, 22. It seems to have lain almost midway between Beth-baal-meon (Main) and Medeba, about three or four miles south-east of Heshbon. Medeba obtains notice in Numbers 21:30; Joshua 13:9, 16; 1 Chronicles 19:7. Mesha says that it was taken from the Moabites by Omri, King of Israel, but recovered by himself at the end of forty 'years (Moabite Stone, 11. 7-9). It lay south-east of Hesh-ben, at the spot which still retains the old name - Madeba. It has been suggested that there was at Nebo a shrine of the Baby-Ionian god so named; but this is to assume a resemblance which the facts at present known do not indicate, between the Moabite and Babylonian religions. On all their heads shall be baldness. The practice of cutting off the hair in mourning was common to the Jews (Isaiah 22:12; Micah 1:16) with various other nations; e.g., the Persians (Herod., 9:24), the Greeks, the Macedonians (Pint., 'Vit. Pelop.,' § 34), the primitive Arabs (Krehl, 'Religion der voris-lamit. Araber,' p. 33, note 1), and the North American Indians (Bancroft,' Native Races of America').

They shall gird themselves with sackcloth. Another widely spread custom, known to the Assyrians (Jonah 3:5), the Syrians (1 Kings 20:31), the Persians (Esther 4:1, 2), the Israelites (Nehemiah 9:1), and, as we see here, to the Moabites. The modern wearing of black garments, especially crape, is representative of the old practice. Every one shall howl. \"Howling\" remains one of the chief tokens of mourning in the East. It was a practice of the Egyptians (Herod., 2:79), of the Persians (ibid., 8:99; 9:24), of the Babylonians (Jeremiah 51:8), and probably of the Orientals generally. Weeping abundantly; or, running down with tears (comp.

Heshbon, now Hesban, lay about twenty miles east of the Jordan, nearly on the parallel of its embouchure into the Dead Sea. It was the capital city of Sihon (Numbers 21:21), who took it from the Moabites. On the partition of Palestine among the tribes of Israel, it was assigned to Reuben (Numbers 32:37; Joshua 13:17); but at a later time we find it reckoned to Gad (1 Chronicles 6:81). We do not know at what time Moab recovered Heshbon, but may conjecture that it was one of the conquests of Mesha, though it is not mentioned on the Moabite Stone. And Elealeh. Elealch is commonly united with Heshbon (Numbers 32:3, 37; Isaiah 16:9; Jeremiah 48:34). It is probably identical with the modern El-A'al, a ruined town on the top of a rounded hill, little more than a mile north of Hesban. Even unto Jahaz. Jahaz lay considerably to the south of Hesh-ben, probably not very far north of the Arnon. It must have been in the vicinity of Dibon, since Mesha, on taking it from the Israelites, annexed it to the territory of that city (Moabite Stone, II. 19-21). It was the scene of the great battle between Sihon and the Israelites under Moses (Numbers 21:23). His life shall be grievous unto him; rather, his soul shall be grieved within him. The Moabite people is personified (Cheyne).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah15:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTMy heart shall cry out for Moab; his fugitives shall flee unto Zoar, an heifer of three years old: for by the mounting up of Luhith with weeping shall they go it up; for in the way of Horonaim they shall raise up a cry of destruction.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 5. - My heart shall cry out for Moab (comp. Isaiah 16:9, 11). The prophet sympathizes with the sufferings of Moab, as a kindred people (Genesis 19:37), and perhaps as having, in the person of Ruth, furnished an ancestress to the Messiah (Matthew 1:5). His fugitives; literally, her fugitives. The country is here personified, instead of the people, the former being feminine, the latter masculine. Shall flee unto Zoar. Zoar, the \"little\" town, spared for Lot's sake (Genesis 19:20-22), is placed by some at the northern, by others at the southern, extremity of the Dead Sea. The present passage makes in favor of the more southern site. An heifer of three years old. Those who defend this rendering refer the simile either to Zest, or to Moab, or to the fugitives. Having regard to the parallel passage of Jeremiah (Jeremiah 48:34), we may pronounce the last explanation to be the best. The resemblance to the heifer will consist in the cries uttered. To ninny critics, however, this idea appears harsh, and the alternative is proposed of regarding Eglath - the word translated \"heifer\" - as a place, and the epithet, \"of three years old,\" as really meaning \"the third.\" Attempts are made to show the existence of three Eglaths in these parts; but they are not very successful; nor is any instance adduced of a city being distinguished from others of the same name by a numerical suffix. The rendering of the Authorized Version may therefore stand, the comparison being regarded as one of the fugitive Moabites to a heifer in its third year, \"rushing along with loud, hopeless bellowings\" (Kay). By the mounting up of Luhith. This ascent has not been identified. It should have been on the way from Moab proper to Zoar. The way of Horonaim. On the Moabite Stone Horonaim is mentioned as a town of the Edomites attacked and taken by Mesha (11:31-33). It lay probably south or southeast of the Dead Sea. The Moabites, flying kern their invaders, seek a refuge in the territories of Edom and Judah, weeping and wailing as they go.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah15:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor the waters of Nimrim shall be desolate: for the hay is withered away, the grass faileth, there is no green thing.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 6. - The waters of Nimrim shall be desolate. The Wady Numeira is a watercourse running into the Dead Sea from the east, hallway between the promontory called the \"Lisan\" and the sea's southern extremity. It is fed by \"six or seven springs\" ('Quarterly Statement' of Palest. Expl. Fatal, October, 1880, p. 254) - \"plenteous brooks gushing from the lofty hills\" (Tristram), and boasts along its banks a number of \"well-watered gardens.\" There is no reason to doubt the identity of this stream with \"the waters of Nimrim.\" Their \"desolation\" was probably caused by the enemy stopping up the sources (2 Kings 3:19, 25; 2 Chronicles 32:3, 4). The hay is withered away. There is luxuriant vegetation in the wadys and ghors at the southern end of the Dead Sea, especially in the Ghor-es-Safiyeh, the Wady Numeira, and the Wady el-Mantara ('Quarterly Statement' of Palest.

It is thought that \"Dimon\" is here put for \"Dibon,\" in order to assimilate the sound to that of dam, blood. St. Jerome says that in his day the place was called indifferently by either name. If we accept this view, \"the waters of Dimon\" will probably be those of the Amen, near which Dibon was situated (see the comment on ver. 2). I will bring more; literally, I will bring additions; i.e. additional calamities, which will cause the stream of the Aton to flow with blood. Lions; or, a lieu. Perhaps Nebuchadnezzar (Jeremiah 4:7), who is said by Josephus to have conquered the Moabites, or possibly Asshur-bani-pal, who overran the country about B.C. 645 (G.

This portion of the \"burden\" is divided into three sections. In section 1 (from ver. 1 to the end of ver. 5) an offer of mercy is made to Moab on certain conditions, viz. that she return to her allegiance to the house of David, and show kindness to fugitive Israelites. In section 2 (vers. 6-12) she is supposed to have rejected this offer, and is threatened (as in Isaiah 15.) with severe punishment. In section 3 (which consists of vers. 13 and 14) the time is fixed for the main visitation to fall upon her. Verse 1. - Send ye the lamb to the ruler of the land; rather, the lamb of the ruler of the land - the lamb (or lambs, kar being used collectively) due to the ruler as a mark of subjection. In the time of Ahab Mesha had paid a tribute to Israel of a hundred thousand lambs and a hundred thousand rams annually (2 Kings 3:4). The prophet recommends that this, or some similar, tribute should now be paid to the King of Judah instead. Israel having been absorbed into Assyria. From Sela. Either Moab is regarded as having taken refuge in Edom, and is therefore bidden to send her tribute from the Edomite capital, Sela (equivalent to \"Petra\"), or \"Sela,\" here is not a proper name, but a collective used to designate the rocky parts of Moab, to which she had betaken herself (as in Jeremiah 48:28). The latter supposition is, on the whole, the more probable. To the wilderness; literally, wildernesswards; i.e. by the way of the wilderness. The enemy being regarded as in possession of the northern end of the Dead Sea, Moab is recommended to send her tribute round the southern end, and so by way of \"the wilderness of Judah,\" to Jerusalem.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah16:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor it shall be, that, as a wandering bird cast out of the nest, so the daughters of Moab shall be at the fords of Arnon.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 2. - For it shall be; rather, and it shall be. The tribute having been paid, Moab will regain some confidence. Her fluttered population will return, and collect at the fords of the Amen, ready to recross it. As a wandering bird cast out of the nest; rather, as a wandering bird (or, wandering birds) - \"as a scattered nest\" (or, \"brood of nestlings\"). The daughters of Moab. The population of Moab generally, as \"the daughter of Zion\" (ver. 1) is the population of Jerusalem generally.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah16:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTTake counsel, execute judgment; make thy shadow as the night in the midst of the noonday; hide the outcasts; bewray not him that wandereth.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 3. - Take counsel, execute judgment, etc. According to most critics, these are the words of the Moabites, or of a Moabite ambassador at Jerusalem, and are a call on Judaea to give shelter to the fugitives from Moab. Some, however, as Dr. Kay, maintain that the words are the prophet's, addressed to Moab, calling on her to treat kindly fugitives from Judaea. Make thy shadow as the night (comp. Isaiah 4:6). In the hot land of Moab the sun is an enemy, and \"the shadow of a great rock\" a welcome refuge.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah16:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTLet mine outcasts dwell with thee, Moab; be thou a covert to them from the face of the spoiler: for the extortioner is at an end, the spoiler ceaseth, the oppressors are consumed out of the land.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 4. - Let mine outcasts dwell with thee, Moab. The change of one accent will allow of this passage being translated, Let the outcasts of Moab dwell with thee; and so it is rendered by the LXX., the Syriac, by Lowth, Gesenius, Hitzig, Ewald, and Mr. Cheyne. Delitzsch and Dr. Kay agree with the Authorized Version. For the extortioner is at an end. This seems to be urged as a reason why the protection asked should be given: it will not be for long - the oppressor is about to receive chastisement. He is called \"the extortioner,\" as exacting the utmost possible tribute from conquered lands. Such exaction was characteristic of Assyria (2 Kings 15:19; 2 Kings 18:14; 'Assyrian Inscriptions,' passim). The spoiler ceaseth; literally, devastation ceaseth.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah16:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd in mercy shall the throne be established: and he shall sit upon it in truth in the tabernacle of David, judging, and seeking judgment, and hasting righteousness.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 5. - And in mercy shall the throne be established; rather, and there shall be a throne established in mercy. A Messianic vision comes upon the prophet in connection with the disappearance of the oppressor. There shall be one day - he knows not how soon or how late - a throne established in mercy, and \"One shall be seated upon it in truth, who. shall occupy the tent [or, 'house'] of David, as one who judges, and seeks justice, and hastens on [the reign of] righteousness.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah16:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWe have heard of the pride of Moab; he is very proud: even of his haughtiness, and his pride, and his wrath: but his lies shall not be so.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 6. - We have heard of the pride of Moab. A new section commences. Moab has not accepted the offer of mercy made in vers. 1-5, and is therefore denounced afresh. Her \"pride\" prevented her from renewing her subjection to the house of David, and therefore it is her pride which is specially condemned. His lies shall not be so; rather, of no worth are his boast-tags. The result will not correspond with them.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah16:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTTherefore shall Moab howl for Moab, every one shall howl: for the foundations of Kirhareseth shall ye mourn; surely they are stricken.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 7. - Every one shall howl; rather, the whole of it shall howl; i.e. the entire nation collectively (comp. Herod., 8:99; 9:24). For the foundations of Kir-Hareseth shall ye mourn. The word here translated \"foundations\" is elsewhere always rendered \"flagons\" or \"flagons of wine\" (2 Samuel 6:19; Song of Solomon 2:5; Hosea 3:1). And this rendering is more agreeable to the context than \"foundations,\" since it is the loss of the products of the soil which is threatened in the next three verses. \"Kir-Hareseth\" is probably the same place as the \"Kir-Moab\" of Isaiah 15:1. It was one of the principal cities of Moab (see 2 Kings 2:25).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah16:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor the fields of Heshbon languish, and the vine of Sibmah: the lords of the heathen have broken down the principal plants thereof, they are come even unto Jazer, they wandered through the wilderness: her branches are stretched out, they are gone over the sea.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 8. - The fields of Heshbon (see the comment on Isaiah 15:4). The whole of the Mishor, or Belka, on the edge of which Hesbdn stands, is cultivable and capable of producing good crops. The Moabites stored water in reservoirs (Song of Solomon 7:4), and made their country a garden. The vine of Sib-mah. \"Sibmah\" is mentioned in Numbers 32:8 and Joshua 13:19 among the towns of the Reubenites. According to Jerome ('Comment. in Esaiam'), it was less than half a mile distant from Heshbon. Jeremiah follows Isaiah in lamenting the destruction of its vines (Jeremiah 48:32). The lords of the heathen have broken down the principal plants thereof. \"The lords of the heathen\" are probably the Assyrians, who made a practice of destroying the fruit trees in an enemy's country, for the mere purpose of doing mischief ('Ancient Monarchies,' vol. 2. p. 84). It is wanton to discard this very satisfactory sense for the strange one that \"the choice plants have broken down - i.e., made drunk - the lords of the heathen\" (Cheyne). The rendering of the Authorized Version is supported by Gesenius, Ewald, Rosenmüller, Meier, and Dr. Kay. They are come even unto Jazer; rather, they (the vines)reached to Jazer; i.e. the vine of Sibmah was cultivated as far as Jazer. Jazer lay about twelve miles north of Heshben, in the territory of Gad (Numbers 32:35). It is probably identified with Es Szir, which is in the required position, and retains a trace of the name (Seetzen,' Reisen,' vol. 1. pp. 397, 398). They wandered through the wilderness; rather, they strayed into the wilderness; i.e. the cultivation was pushed eastward into the actual midbar, or desert. Her branches are stretched out; or, her offshoots are spread abroad; i.e. the young shoots or slips are taken by the cultivators and spread further and further. They are even carried across the Dead Sea, and planted on its western shore. Mr. Cheyne supposes the prophet to refer to the \"vineyards of En-gedi\" (Song of Solomon 1:14).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah16:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTTherefore I will bewail with the weeping of Jazer the vine of Sibmah: I will water thee with my tears, O Heshbon, and Elealeh: for the shouting for thy summer fruits and for thy harvest is fallen.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 9. - Therefore I will bewail (comp. Isaiah 15:5, and see the Homiletics on that verse). With the weeping of Jazer. \"With tears as genuine as Jazer's own\" (Kay). O Heshbon and Elealeh (on the close connection of these two cities, see the comment on Isaiah 15:4). For the shouting, etc.; rather, for on thy summer fruits and on thy harvest a shouting is fallen. The \"shouting\" intended is that of the invading enemy, which replaces the ordinary joy-song of the vintagers (see ver. 10).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah16:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd gladness is taken away, and joy out of the plentiful field; and in the vineyards there shall be no singing, neither shall there be shouting: the treaders shall tread out no wine in their presses; I have made their vintage shouting to cease.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 10. - The plentiful field; Hebrew, Carmel. The word carmel seems to designate \"garden,\" or \"orchard ground\" generally, without reference to the degree of fertility. It is generally rendered by our translators \"fruitful field,\" which is right, if we regard \"fruitful\" as equivalent to \"fruit-producing.\" No singing... no shouting. Those who have heard the vintage-songs in the north of Italy and elsewhere will appreciate the sadness of this silence. The treaders shall tread out no wine in their presses. Wine-presses were in or near the vineyards. They consisted of two vats, or two reservoirs cut in the rock, one above the other, with a passage of communication between them. The grapes were placed in the upper vat or reservoir, and were crushed by the naked feet of the vintagers. Sometimes as many as seven persons \"trod the wine-press\" together (Wilkinson, 'Ancient Egyptians,' vol. 1. p. 45). It was usual for them to sing as they trod (Jeremiah 25:30; Jeremiah 48:33). I have made their vintage shouting to cease. The prophet is the mouthpiece of God. Accidentally, as it were, he here betrays the personality which is behind him. It is not he, but God, who has caused the invasion which has reduced the vintagers to silence.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah16:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWherefore my bowels shall sound like an harp for Moab, and mine inward parts for Kirharesh.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 11. - My bowels shall sound like an harp for Moab; i.e. they shall vibrate with thrills of grief (Kay).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah16:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd it shall come to pass, when it is seen that Moab is weary on the high place, that he shall come to his sanctuary to pray; but he shall not prevail.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 12. - When it is seen that Moab is weary; rather, when Moab shows himself, and has wearied himself. The heathen \"thought to be heard for their much speaking\" (Matthew 6:7). They endeavored to weary their gods into granting their prayers (1 Kings 18:26), and frequently succeeded in wearying themselves. On the high place. \"High places\" (bamoth) were common to the Moabites, with the other nations of Syria and Palestine. Mesha, in his inscription, speaks of having rebuilt a city called \"Beth-Bamoth\" (1:27), which must have been a \"city of high places;\" and he even calls the stele which he dedicates to Chemosh, whereon his inscription is written, a bamah, or \"high place.\" That he shall come to his sanctuary... but he shall not, etc.; rather, and has come into his sanctuary, that he shall not prevail.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah16:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThis is the word that the LORD hath spoken concerning Moab since that time.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 13. - This is the word, etc. The third and concluding section begins here. This prophecy, Isaiah says, is one, not now delivered for the first time, but existent previously. How long previously, he leaves quite vague.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah16:14VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut now the LORD hath spoken, saying, Within three years, as the years of an hireling, and the glory of Moab shall be contemned, with all that great multitude; and the remnant shall be very small and feeble.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 14. - But now. \"Now\" - an addition has been made to the prophecy. Isaiah is authorized to announce that in three years' time, counted as strictly as possible, the judgment pronounced shall fall on Moab; her \"glory\" shall be turned into shame, her \"multitude\" shall be cut off, and only a \"remnant\" shall be left, weak, small, and powerless. As the years of an hireling. Counted with the utmost exactness. A hireling would not consent to serve a day longer than his contract bound him, nor would his master consent that he should serve a day short of it. With all that great multitude. We have no means of accurately estimating the population of Moab. The entire area of the region which the Moabites inhabited seems to have been not more than fifteen hundred square miles. The greater part of it was, however, exceedingly fertile; and we are, perhaps, justified in allowing it a population of two hundred to the square mile, which is about that of Germany. This would give three hundred thousand inhabitants, of whom the adult males would be seventy-five thousand. Feeble; literally, not powerful; i.e. very much the contrary, very weak. Moab seems to have offered a very slight resistance to Asshur-bani-pal (G. Smith, 'History of Asshur-bani-pal,' p. 259).NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINE","Isa.17":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah17:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe burden of Damascus. Behold, Damascus is taken away from being a city, and it shall be a ruinous heap.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 1-3. - THE BURDEN OF DAMASCUS. The eye of the prophet travels northwards from Moab, and, passing over Ammon as an enemy of small account, rests once more upon Damascus, already threatened in Isaiah 7:1 - 9, and probably already partially punished. Damascus is seen once more in alliance with Ephraim (ver. 3), and the two are joined with a new power, Aroer (ver. 2), which possesses several \"cities.\" Woe is denounced on all the three powers: desolation on Damascus and Aroer; on Damascus and Ephraim, the complete loss of the last shadow of independence. The Assyrian inscriptions point out, as the probable date of the prophecy, the commencement of Sargun's reign - about B.C. 722 or 721. Verse 1. - Damascus is taken away from being a city. According to Vitringa, Damascus has been destroyed oftener than any other town; but it has a wonderful power of rising again from its ashes. Probably a destruction by Sargon is here intended ('Records of the Past,' vol. 9. p. 6).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah17:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe cities of Aroer are forsaken: they shall be for flocks, which shall lie down, and none shall make them afraid.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 2. - The cities of Aroer are forsaken. That the Aroer of this passage cannot be either that on the Arnon, or that facing Rabbath-Ammon (Joshua 13:25), has long been perceived and recognized (see Mr. Grove's article on \"Aroer\" in the 'Dict. of the Bible,' vol. 1. p. 115). It is evidently a city of the same name lying much further towards the north. Arid it is a city of far greater importance, having \"cities\" dependent on it. Now, Sargon's annals tell us of a \"Gal'gar,\" a name well expressing the Hebrew ערער, which was united in a league with Damascus, Samaria, Arpad, and Simyra, in the second year of Sargon, and was the scene of a great battle and a great destruction. Sargon besieged it, took it, and reduced it to ashes ('Records of the Past,' 50.s.e.). There is every reason to recognize the \"Aroer\" of this verse in the \"Gargar\" of Sargon's inscriptions. They shall be for flocks (comp. Isaiah 5:17; Isaiah 7:25). It marked the very extreme of desolation, that cattle should be pastured on the sites of cities. None shall make them afraid; i.e. \"there shall be no inhabitants to make any objection.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah17:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe fortress also shall cease from Ephraim, and the kingdom from Damascus, and the remnant of Syria: they shall be as the glory of the children of Israel, saith the LORD of hosts.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 3. - The fortress also shall cease from Ephraim. Sargon did not destroy Samaria on the occasion of his first capture. But he says that he \"reduced it to a heap of ruins\" on the occasion of its second capture ('Records of the Past,' l.s.c.). And the kingdom from Damascus. We do not hear of any King of Damascus after Rezin, who was slain by Tiglath-Pileser about B.C. 732. Damascus, however, reasserted her independence in B.C. 721, and probably set up a king at the same time. In B.C. 720 she was reduced and destroyed. Nothing more is heard of her until B.C. 694 - the eleventh year of Sen-nacherib - when her \"governor\" is Assyrian Eponym, and she must therefore have been absorbed into the Assyrian empire. The remnant of Syria. This phrase shows that the great blow which struck down Syria - Tiglath-Pileser's capture of Damascus and slaughter of Rezin - was a thing of the past. Syria was already but \"a remnant.\" Now she was to cease to exist altogether. They shall be as the glory of the children of Israel. Ironical. The irony is made apparent by the next verse.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah17:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd in that day it shall come to pass, that the glory of Jacob shall be made thin, and the fatness of his flesh shall wax lean.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 4-11. - A DENUNCIATION OF WOE ON ISRAEL, COMBINED WITH THE PROMISE OF A REMNANT. Israel, having united herself with Syria to resist the Assyrians, will incur a similar fate. Her glory will decay, her population dwindle and almost disappear. Still there will be a few left, who, under the circumstances, will turn to God (ver. 7). But it will be too late for anything like a national recovery; the laud will remain \"a desolation\" on account of the past sins of its inhabitants (vers. 9-11). Verse 4. - The glory of Jacob shall be made thin. There is reason to believe that the deportation of the Israelites was gradual. Sargon, on taking Samaria for the first time, in B.C. 722, carried off no more than 27, 290 of the inhabitants (G. Smith, 'Eponym Canon,' p. 125). Over the remainder he appointed governors, and required them to pay the same taxation as before. About B.C. 715 he placed a number of Arabs in Samaria, probably deporting natives to make room for them (ibid., p. 128). The continuant of a remnant of Israelites in the land down to B.C. 625 is indicated by 2 Chronicles 34:9. The fatness of his flesh shall wax lean (comp. Isaiah 10:16). Depopulation is primarily intended; but there is, perhaps, also a more general reference to depression, wasting, and misery.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah17:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd it shall be as when the harvestman gathereth the corn, and reapeth the ears with his arm; and it shall be as he that gathereth ears in the valley of Rephaim.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 5. - As when the harvestman gathereth the corn. Death is the \"harvestman\" here, and gathers the Israelites by shocks, or sheaves, into his garner. A great depopulation appears in 2 Kings 17:25, where we learn that lions so multiplied in the land as to become a terror to the few inhabitants. Reapeth the ears. Mr. Cheyne well remarks that the \"ears\" only were reaped, the stalk being cut close under the ear. This was the practice also in Egypt (Rawlinson,' Hist. of Ancient Egypt,' vol. 1. p. 162). In the valley of Rephaim. The valley of Rephaim was the scene of David's double victory over the Philistines, related in 2 Samuel 5:17-25. It is disputed whether it lay north or south of Jerusalem; but the connection with Bethlehem (2 Samuel 23:13-17) and with the cave of Adullam seem decisive in favor of a southern position.

There is no mention of grapes, and it is clear that the \"gleaning\" intended is that of an olive-ground. As the shaking of an olive tree; rather, as at the beating of an olive tree. The olive crop was obtained, not by shaking, but by beating the trees (Deuteronomy 24:20). The owner was forbidden to \"go over the boughs again,\" in order that a portion of the crop might be left for the stranger, the widow, and the fatherless to glean. In the top of the uppermost bough.

Josiah, about B.C. 631, broke down altars throughout all the land of Israel, in the cities of Manasseh and Ephraim and Simeon (?), even unto Naphtali (2 Chronicles 34:5-7). Apparently he had the consent of the inhabitants to this demolition. Either the groves, or the images, Asherah, the word here and elsewhere commonly translated \"grove\" in the Authorized Version, is now generally admitted to have designated an artificial construction of wood or metal, which was used in the idolatrous worship of the Phoenicians and the Israelites, probably as the emblem of some deity. The Assyrian \"sacred tree\" was most likely an emblem of the same kind, and may give an idea of the sort of object worshipped under the name of Asherah (comp. 'Ancient Monarchies,' vol. 2. pp. 235-237). The Israelites, in the time of their prosperity, had set up \"groves\" of this character \"on every high hill, and under every green tree\" (2 Kings 17:10). Many of them were still standing when Josiah made his iconoclastic raid into the Israelite country (2 Chronicles 34:5-7), and were broken down by him at the same time as the altars. The \"images\" of this place are the same as those coupled with the Israelite \"groves\" in 2 Chronicles 34:7, namely \"sun-images,\" emblems of Baal, probably pillars or conical stones, such as are known to have held a place in the religious worship of Phoenicia.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah17:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTIn that day shall his strong cities be as a forsaken bough, and an uppermost branch, which they left because of the children of Israel: and there shall be desolation.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 9. - In that day. While a remnant of the Israelites shall repent and turn to God, throwing in their lot with Judah, as it would seem the country generally shall feel the weight of God's chastening hand, on account of Israel's former sins and offences. As a forsaken bough, and an uppermost branch; rather, as the forsaken tract of woodland and mountain-crest (Kay). The reference is to the condition of the land when it passed out of the possession of the Canaanitish nations. It was then forsaken and desolate. So shall it be once more, when Israel is expelled for the same sins (see 2 Kings 17:7, 8). Which they left because of the children of Israel; rather, which men forsook before the children of Israel; i.e. from which the Canaanites fled as the children of Israel advanced and took possession. The writer ignores the long and fierce struggle which the Canaanites made, and looks only to the result - retirement from a desolated country.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah17:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBecause thou hast forgotten the God of thy salvation, and hast not been mindful of the rock of thy strength, therefore shalt thou plant pleasant plants, and shalt set it with strange slips:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 10. - Because thou hast forgotten; rather, because thou didst forget. The late repentance of a \"remnant\" which \"looked to their Maker\" (ver. 7) could not cancel the long catalogue of former sins (2 Kings 17:8-17), foremost among which was their rejection of God, or, at any rate, their complete forgetfulness of his claims upon them. The Rock of thy strength. God is first called \"a Rock\" in Deuteronomy 32:4, 15, 18, 30, 31. The image is caught up by the psalmists (2 Samuel 22:2, 32, 47; 2 Samuel 23:3; Psalm 16:1, 2, 31, 46; 19:14; 28:1, etc.), and from them passes to Isaiah (see, besides the present passage, Isaiah 26:4; Isaiah 30:29; and Isaiah 44:8). Among the later prophets only Habakkuk uses it (Habakkuk 1:12). Israel, instead of looking to this \"Rock,\" had looked to their rock-fortresses (ver. 9). Therefore shalt thou plant pleasant plants; rather, dost thou plant, or hast thou planted. Forgetfulness of Jehovah has led to the adoption of a voluptuous religion - one of debased foreign rites. There is possibly, as Mr. Cheyne thinks, a special reference to the cult of Adonis. Shall set it; rather, settest it, or hast set it. \"It\" must refer to \"field\" or \"garden\" understood. The later Israelite religion has been a sort of pleasant garden, planted with exotic slips from various quarters - Phoenicia, Syria, Moab, etc. It has been thought permissible to introduce into it any new cult that took the fancy. Hence the multiplication of altars complained of by Hosea (Hosea 8:11; Hosea 10:1; Hosea 12:11).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah17:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTIn the day shalt thou make thy plant to grow, and in the morning shalt thou make thy seed to flourish: but the harvest shall be a heap in the day of grief and of desperate sorrow.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 11. - In the day; or, in a day (Kay). Shalt thou make; rather, thou makest. Each new slip that is planted is forced to take root and grow and flourish at once; the next morning it is expected to have formed its seed and reached perfection. So the harvest is hurried on; but when it is reached, the day of visitation has arrived - a day of grief and of desperate sorrow.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah17:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWoe to the multitude of many people, which make a noise like the noise of the seas; and to the rushing of nations, that make a rushing like the rushing of mighty waters!VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 12-14. - A PROPHECY AGAINST ASSYRIA. This passage is, apparently, out of place. At any rate, it is quite unconnected with what precedes, and almost equally so with what follows. Still, it must be borne in mind that, until the destruction of Sennacherib's army, Isaiah has the thought of the Assyrians, as the pressing danger, always before him, and continually reverts to it, often abruptly, and without preparation (see Isaiah 5:26-30; Isaiah 7:17-25; Isaiah 8:5-8; Isaiah 10:5-19, 24-34; Isaiah 14:24-27). The present prophecy seems, more distinctly than any other in the purely prophetical chapters, to point to the miraculous destruction of the hoot which Sennacherib was about to bring against Jerusalem. Verse 12. - Woe to the multitude of many people; rather, Ho for the tumult of many peoples! The advance of an army composed of soldiers from many nations is descried. They advance with noise and tumult - a tumult compared with that of \"seas that are tumultuous.\" Under the circumstances of the time, it is reasonable to suppose the Assyrians to be intended (comp. Isaiah 22:6, 7). The rushing sound of the advance is borne in strongly upon the prophet's mind, and made the subject of three consecutive clauses.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah17:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe nations shall rush like the rushing of many waters: but God shall rebuke them, and they shall flee far off, and shall be chased as the chaff of the mountains before the wind, and like a rolling thing before the whirlwind.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 13. - God shall rebuke them; literally, he shall rebuke them - he who alone can do so. There is no need to mention his name. They shall flee far off. The destruction of the great bulk of Sennacherib's army in the night was followed, as soon as morning came, by the hasty flight of the survivors (2 Kings 19:36; Isaiah 37:37). And shall be chased. Herodotus says that the Egyptians pursued the army of Sennacherib and slew vast numbers (2:141). As the chaff of the mountains (comp. Hosea 13:3). Threshing-floors were ordinarily placed upon eminences (2 Samuel 24:18; 2 Chronicles 3:1), where the wind had freer course and consequently greater power.

He is not (comp. 2 Kings 19:35, \"They were all dead corpses\").

Amid the general excitement caused by the advance of Assyria, Ethiopia also is stirred, and stirred to its furthest limits. The king sends messengers in beats upon the canals and rivers to summon his troops to his standard (vers. 1, 2). The earth stands agaze to see the result of the approaching collision (ver. 3); but God rests calmly in heaven while events are ripening (vers. 4, 5). When the time comes he will strike the blow - Assyria will be given to the fowls of the air and the beasts of the field (ver. 6). Then Ethiopia will make an act of homage to Jehovah by the sending of a present to Jerusalem (ver. 7). The time seems to be that immediately preceding the great invasion of Sennacherib (about B.C. 700), when Shabatok the Ethiopian was King of Egypt, and Tirhakah (Tahark) either Crown Prince under him, or more probably Lord Paramount of Egypt over him, and reigning at Napata. Verse 1. - Woe to the land; rather, Ho for the land! (comp. Isaiah 17:12). Shadowing with wings; literally, either the land of the shadow of wings or the land of the noise of wings, most probably the latter. Allusion is thought to be made to the swarms of buzzing flies, especially the tsetse, with which Ethiopia abounds. At the same time, these swarms are, perhaps, intended to be taken as emblems of the hosts of warriors which Ethiopia can send forth (comp. Isaiah 7:18). Beyond the rivers of Ethiopia. The prophet cannot be supposed to have had more than a vague knowledge of African geography. He seems, however, robe aware that Ethiopia is a land of many rivers (see Baker's 'Nile Tributaries'), and he assumes that the dominion of the Ethiopian kings extends even beyond these rivers to the south of them. His object is, as Mr. Cheyne says, \"to emphasize the greatness of Ethiopia.\" It may be questioned, however, whether the dominion of the Ethiopian kings of the time extended so far as he supposed. The seat of their power was Napata, now Gebel Berkal, in the great bend of the Nile between lat. 18° and 19° N.; and its southern limit was probably Khar-toum and the line of the Blue Nile (see Rawlinson's 'History of Ancient Egypt,' vol. 2. p. 436).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah18:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThat sendeth ambassadors by the sea, even in vessels of bulrushes upon the waters, saying, Go, ye swift messengers, to a nation scattered and peeled, to a people terrible from their beginning hitherto; a nation meted out and trodden down, whose land the rivers have spoiled!VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 2. - That sendeth ambassadors; rather, perhaps, messengers, as the word is translated in Isaiah 57:9 and Proverbs 25:13. They are sent, apparently, by the king to his own people. By the sea. \"The sea\" must in this place necessarily mean the Nile, which is called \"the sea\" in Nahum 3:8 certainly, and probably in Isaiah 19:5. Vessels of papyrus could not possibly have been employed in the very difficult navigation of the Red Sea. Vessels of bulrushes. That some of the boats used upon the Nile were constructed of the papyrus (which is a sort of bulrush) we learn from Herodotus (it. 96), Theophrastus ('Hist. Plant.,' 4:9), Plutarch ('De Isid. et Osir.,' § 18), Pliny (Hist. 'Nat.,' 6:22), and Lucan ('Pharsal.,' 4:136). They are represented occasionally on the Egyptian monuments. Saying. This word is interpolated by our translators, and gives a wrong sense. It is the prophet that addresses the messengers, not the king who sends them. To a nation scattered and peeled; rather, tall and polished, or tall and sleek. The word translated \"scattered\" means properly \"drawn out,\" and seems to be applied here to the physique of the Ethiopians, whose stature is said to have been remarkable (Herod., 3:20, 114). The other epithet refers to the glossy skin of the people. A people terrible from their beginning hitherto; The Israelites first knew the Ethiopians as soldiers when they formed a part of the army brought by Shishak (Sheshonk I.) against Rehoboam, about B.C. 970 (2 Chronicles 12:3). They had afterwards experience of their vast numbers, when Zerah made his attack upon Asa; but on this occasion they succeeded in defeating them (2 Chronicles 14:9-13). It was not till about two centuries after this that the power of Ethiopia began to be really formidable to Egypt; and the \"miserable Cushites,\" as they had been in the habit of calling them, acquired the preponderating influence in the valley of the Nile, and under Piankhi, Shabak, Shabatek, and Tirhakah (Tahark), reduced Egypt to subjection. Isaiah, perhaps, refers to their rise under Piankhi as \"their beginning.\" A nation meted out and trodden down; rather, a nation of meting out and trampling; i.e. one accustomed to mete out its neighbors' bounds with a measuring-line, and to trample other nations under its feet. Whose land the rivers have spoiled; rather, whose land rivers despoil. The deposit of mud, which fertilizes Egypt, is washed by the rivers from Ethiopia, which is thus continually losing large quantities of rich son. This fact was well known to the Greeks (Herod., 2:12, ad fin.), and there is no reason why Isaiah should not have been acquainted with it.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah18:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAll ye inhabitants of the world, and dwellers on the earth, see ye, when he lifteth up an ensign on the mountains; and when he bloweth a trumpet, hear ye.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 3. - All ye inhabitants of the world. From exhorting the messengers to hasten on their errand, Isaiah turns to the nations generally, and bids them attend to a coming signal - an ensign is about to be raised, a trumpet is about to be sounded - let them gaze and hearken; the result will be well worth noting. The imagery is not to be taken literally, but in the same way as the notices in Isaiah 11:10, 12; Isaiah 13:2. When he lifteth up an ensign... when he bloweth a trumpet; rather, when an ensign is lifted up... when a trumpet sounds. On the mountains. Wherever the great event took place, the signal for it was given on the mountains of Judea (see 2 Kings 19:20-34).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah18:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor so the LORD said unto me, I will take my rest, and I will consider in my dwelling place like a clear heat upon herbs, and like a cloud of dew in the heat of harvest.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 4. - For so; rather, for thus. The word koh is prospective. I will take my rest, and I will consider; or, I will be still and look on. The rest of God is contrasted with the bustle and hurry of the Ethiopians and Assyrians. God \"sits in his holy seat,\" calm and tranquil, knowing what the result is about to be, and when it will be; he waits while the influences of heat and moisture, sunshine and dew - his own agencies - ripen Assyria's schemes, impassive, taking no part. Then, suddenly, he takes the part described in the latter portion of ver. 5, \"cuts off the shoots and hews down the branches.\" Like a clear heat upon herbs, etc.; rather, while there is clear heat in the sunshine, while there is a cloud of dew in the harvest-warmth; i.e. while surrounding influences are such as must favor the growth of Assyria's power and pride.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah18:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor afore the harvest, when the bud is perfect, and the sour grape is ripening in the flower, he shall both cut off the sprigs with pruning hooks, and take away and cut down the branches.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 5. - For afore the harvest. God can rest thus tranquil, because he can step in at any time; and this he is about to do, before Assyria reaps her harvest. When the bud is perfect, etc.; rather, when the blossom is past, and the green grape is becoming a ripening bunch. He shall cut off (comp. Isaiah 10:33, 34). The metaphor is slightly varied in this place, to suit the imagery of the preceding clause, where Assyria has been represented as a vine-stock. Formerly her \"boughs\" were to be \"lopped;\" now her \"branches\" and \"sprigs\" or \"sprouts\" are to be cut away with pruning-hooks.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah18:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThey shall be left together unto the fowls of the mountains, and to the beasts of the earth: and the fowls shall summer upon them, and all the beasts of the earth shall winter upon them.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 6. - They shall be left together unto the fowls. At length imagery is dropped. The vine is shown to be an army, slaughtered all \"together,\" and left a prey to kites and vultures, jackals and hyaenas. Shall summer... shall winter. They will furnish food to the beasts and birds of prey for the remainder of the year.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah18:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTIn that time shall the present be brought unto the LORD of hosts of a people scattered and peeled, and from a people terrible from their beginning hitherto; a nation meted out and trodden under foot, whose land the rivers have spoiled, to the place of the name of the LORD of hosts, the mount Zion.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 7. - In that time shall the present be brought; rather, a present. It would not be at all improbable that Tirkakah should, after the destruction of Sennacherib's army, send a gift to the temple of the Jews, either as a recognition of the miracle as wrought by Jehovah, or simply as a thank offering. Necho sent the armor in which he had fought at Megiddo to the temple of Apollo at Branchidae, near Miletus, as a thank offering (Herod., 2:159). We have, however, no historical record of Tirkakah's present as sent. Of a people; rather, from a people (compare the next clause, which supplies the ellipse of the preposition).

Behold, the LORD rideth upon a swift cloud, and shall come into Egypt: and the idols of Egypt shall be moved at his presence, and the heart of Egypt shall melt in the midst of it.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 1-17. - THE BURDEN OF EGYPT. It has been doubted whether this prophecy refers to the conquest of Egypt by Piankhi, as related in the monument which he set up at Napata, or to that by Esarhaddon, of which we gain our knowledge from the inscriptions of his son, Asshur-bani-pal. In the former case, we must suppose it written as early as B.C. 735; in the latter, its date might be as late as B.C. 690. The division of Egypt, \"kingdom against kingdom,\" is a circumstance rather in favor of the earlier date; but the \"cruel lord,\" and the mention of the \"princes of Zoan and Noph,\" are decisive for the later. Piankhi is anything rather than a \"cruel lord,\" being particularly mild and clement; Napata (Noph) is under him, and cannot be said to have been \"deceived\" or to have \"seduced Egypt;\" and Zoan plays no part in the history of the period. Esarhaddon, on the contrary, was decidedly a \"cruel\" prince, and treated Egypt with great severity, splitting it up into a number of governments. Zoan was one of the leading cities of the time, and Noph was the leading power on the Egyptian side, the head of the patriotic party which resisted the Assyrian monarch, but to no purpose. We may, therefore, regard this prophecy as one of Isaiah's latest, placed where it is merely on account of its head-tug - the compiler having placed all the \"burdens\" against foreign countries together. Verse 1. - The Lord rideth upon a swift cloud. Natural imagery to express the rapidity of Divine visitations (comp. Psalm 104:3). God, being about to visit Egypt with a judgment of extreme severity, is represented as entering the land in person (so in Isaiah 13:5). The idols of Egypt shall be moved. Neither Piankhi nor any other Ethiopian conqueror made war on the Egyptian idols; but the Assyrians were always bent on humbling the gods of the hostile countries (see above, Isaiah 10:10; and comp. Isaiah 36:18-20). We have no detailed account of Esarhaddon's campaign; but we find Asshur-bani-pal's first victory over Tirhakah immediately followed by the presentation to him in his camp of Egyptian deities (G. Smith, 'History of Asshur-bani-pal,' p. 20, 1. 1), i.e. of their images. These were probably taken to Nineveh, or else destroyed. At a later date, the same monarch deprived an Egyptian temple of two of its sacred obelisks (ibid., p. 54, 11. 4, 5). The heart of Egypt shall molt (coup. Isaiah 13:7; Psalm 22:14).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah19:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd I will set the Egyptians against the Egyptians: and they shall fight every one against his brother, and every one against his neighbour; city against city, and kingdom against kingdom.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 2. - I will set the Egyptians against the Egyptians. The disintegration of Egypt commenced about B.C. 760-750, towards the close of the twenty-second dynasty. About B.C. 735 a struggle began between Plan-khi, King of Upper Egypt, and Tafnekhf, King of Sais and Memphis, in which the other princes took different sides. Ten or twelve years later there was a struggle between Bocchoris and Sabaeo. From this time onwards, until Psamatik I. reestablished the unity of Egypt (about B.C. 650), the country was always more or less divided, and on the occurrence of any crisis the princes were apt to make war one up, n another. Kingdom against kingdom. During the period of disintegration, the title of\" king\" was assumed by most of the potty princes, though they were little more than chiefs of cities (see 'Records of the Past,' vol. 2. p. 100; G. Smith, 'History of Asshur-bani-pal,' pp. 20-22).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah19:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the spirit of Egypt shall fail in the midst thereof; and I will destroy the counsel thereof: and they shall seek to the idols, and to the charmers, and to them that have familiar spirits, and to the wizards.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 3. - They shall seek to the idols. The Egyptians believed that their gods gave them oracles. Menephthah claims to have been warned by Phthah, the god of Memphis, not to take the field in person against the Libyans when they invaded the Delta, but to leave the task of contending with them to his generals (Brugsch, 'History of Egypt,' vol. 2. p. 119). Herodotus speaks of there being several well-known oracular shrines in Egypt, the most trustworthy being that of Maut, at the city which he calls Buto (2. 152; comp. Isaiah 111). The charmers... them that have familiar spirits... wizards. Classes of men corresponding to the \"magicians\" and \"wise men\" of earlier times (Genesis 41:8). (On the large place which magic occupied in the thoughts of the Egyptians, see 'Pulpit Commentary' on Exodus 7:11.) There was no diminution of the confidence reposed in them as time went on; and some remains of their practices seem to survive to the present day.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah19:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the Egyptians will I give over into the hand of a cruel lord; and a fierce king shall rule over them, saith the Lord, the LORD of hosts.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 4. - The Egyptians will I give over into the hand of a cruel lord. It has been observed above that Piankhi will not answer to this description. It will, however, well suit Esarhaddon. Esarhaddon, soon after his accession, cut off the heads of Abdi-Milkut, King of Sidon, and of Sanduarri, King of Kundi, and hung them round the necks of two of their chief officers (G. Smith, 'Eponym Canon,' pp. 137-139). In an expedition which he made into Arabia, he slew eight of the sovereigns, two of them being women ('Records of the Past,' vol. 3. pp. 106, 107). On conquering Egypt he treated it with extreme severity. Not only did he divide up the country into twenty governments, but he changed the names of the towns, and assigned to his twenty governors, as their main duty, that they were \"to slay, plunder, and spoil\" their subjects (G. Smith, 'History of Asshur-bani-pal,' p. 37, 1. 7; comp. p. 16, 1. 7). He certainly well deserved the appellations of \"a cruel lord,\" \"a fierce king.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah19:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the waters shall fail from the sea, and the river shall be wasted and dried up.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 5 - The waters shall fail from the sea. By \"the sea\" it is generally allowed that the Nile must be meant, as in Isaiah 18:2 and Nahum 3:8. The failure might be caused by deficient rains in Abyssinia and Equatorial Africa, producing an insufficient inundation. It might be aggravated by the neglect of dykes and canals, which would be the natural consequence of civil disorders (see Canon Cook's 'Inscription of Piankhi,' p. 14). Wasted and dried up; rather, parched and dried up. Allowance must be made for Oriental hyperbole. The meaning is only that there shall be a great deficiency in the water supply. Such a deficiency has often been the cause of terrible famines in Egypt.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah19:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd they shall turn the rivers far away; and the brooks of defence shall be emptied and dried up: the reeds and flags shall wither.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 6. - And they shall turn the rivers far away; rather, and the rivers shall stagnate (Cheyne). Probably the canals are intended, as in Exodus 7:19 (see 'Pulpit Commentary,' ad loc.). The brooks of defense shall be emptied. Some render this \"brooks of Egypt,\" regarding matsor as here used for \"Mitsraim;\" but our translation is more forcible, and may well stand. The \"brooks of defense\" are those which had hitherto formed the moats round walled cities (comp. Isaiah 37:25; Nahum 3:8). The reeds and flags shall wither. Reeds, flags, rushes, and water-plants of all kinds abound in the backwaters of the Nile, and the numerous ponds and marshes connected with its overflow (see the 'Pulpit Commentary' on Exodus 2:3, p. 24). These forms of vegetation would be the first to wither on the occurrence of a deficient inundation.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah19:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe paper reeds by the brooks, by the mouth of the brooks, and every thing sown by the brooks, shall wither, be driven away, and be no more.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 7. - The paper reeds by the brooks, etc.; rather, the meadows on the river, along the banks of the river, and every seed-plot by the river. The banks of the Nile were partly grass-land (Genesis 41:2, 18), partly cultivated in grain or vegetables (Herod., 2:14), in either case producing the most luxuriant crops. All, however, depended on the inundation, and if that failed, or so far as it failed, the results predicted by the prophet would happen.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah19:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe fishers also shall mourn, and all they that cast angle into the brooks shall lament, and they that spread nets upon the waters shall languish.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 8. - The fishers also shall mourn. The fisherman's trade was extensively practiced in ancient Egypt, and anything which interfered with it would necessarily be regarded as a great calamity. A large class supported itself by the capture and sale of fish fresh or salted. The Nile produced great abundance of fish, both in its main stream and in its canals and backwaters. Lake Moeris also provided an extensive supply (Herod., 2:149). All they that east angle into the brooks; rather, into the river. Fishing with a hook was practiced in Egypt, though not very widely, except as an amusement by the rich. Actual hooks have been found, not very different from modern ones (Rawlinson, 'History of Ancient Egypt,' vol. 1. p. 506), and representations of angling occur in some of the tombs. Sometimes a line only is used, sometimes a rod and line (see Rawlinson, 'Herodotus,' vol. 2. pp. 101, 103, 2nd edit.). They that spread nets. Nets were very much more widely employed than lines and hooks. Ordinarily a dragnet was used; but sometimes small fry were taken in the shallows by means of a double-handled landing-net (ibid., p. 108, note 2).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah19:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTMoreover they that work in fine flax, and they that weave networks, shall be confounded.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 9. - They that work in fine flax. Linen of great fineness and delicacy was woven in Egypt, for the priests' dresses, for mummy-cloths, and for corselets. Solomon imported \"linen yarn\" from his Egyptian neighbors (1 Kings 10:28), and the Phoenicians a linen fabric for their sails' (Ezekiel 27:7). In the general decline of Egyptian prosperity, caused by the circumstances of the time, the manufacturers of linen would suffer. They that weave networks; rather, they that weave while clothes. Cotton fabrics are probably intended.

Zoan, or Tanis, which had been an insignificant city since the time of the shepherd-kings, came to the front once more at the time of the struggle between Egypt and Assyria. Esarhaddon made it the head of one of the petty kingdoms into which he divided Egypt (G. Smith, 'History of Asshur-bani-pal,' p. 21, 1. 2). Early in the reign of his son it revolted, in conjunction with Sais and Mendes, but was ere long reduced to subjection by the Assyrians. Its king, Petu-bastes, was taken to Nineveh, and there probably put to death. Its \"princes\" were, no doubt, among those who counseled resistance to Assyria. The counsel of the wise, etc.; literally, as for the wise coun-sellers of Pharaoh, their counsel is become senseless. Two classes of advisers seem to be intended - nobles, supposed to be qualified by birth; and \"wise men,\" qualified by study and education. Both would now be found equally incapable. Pharaoh. Probably Tirhakah is intended. It is possible that he was really suzerain of Egypt at the time of Sennacherib's invasion, when Shabatek was nominally king. It is certain that, after the death of Shabatok (about B.C. 698), he was recognized as sovereign both of Ethiopia and of Egypt, and ruled over both countries. Esarhaddon found him still occupying this position in B.C. 673, when he made his Egyptian expedition. Tirhakah's capital at this time was Memphis. How say ye, etc.?

There are no grounds for changing \"Noph\" into \"Moph.\" \"Noph\" is probably \"Napata,\" known as \"Nap\" in the hieroglyphic inscriptions - the original capital of the Ethiopian kings, and, when Memphis had become their capital, still probably regarded as the second city of the empire. The \"princes of Noph\" would be Tirhakah's counselors. They have also, etc. Translate, Even they have led Egypt astray, who are the corner-stone of her tribes. Strictly speaking, there were no \"tribes\" in Egypt, much less \"castes,\" but only classes, marked out by strong lines of demarcation the one from the other. Herodotus gives seven of them (2. 164) - priests, soldiers, herdsmen, swineherds, tradesmen, interpreters, and boatmen. But there were several others also, e.g., agricultural laborers, fishermen, artisans, official employee, etc.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah19:14VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe LORD hath mingled a perverse spirit in the midst thereof: and they have caused Egypt to err in every work thereof, as a drunken man staggereth in his vomit.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 14. - The Lord hath mingled a perverse spirit, etc. \"Shall there be evil in a city, and the Lord hath not done it?\" (Amos 3:6). To bring Egypt into so distracted a state, the hand of God had been necessary. He had introduced into the nation \"a spirit of perverseness.\" Those in whom this spirit was had then \"led Egypt astray in all her doings.\" They had made her \"like a drunken man,\" who \"staggers\" along his path, and slips in \"his own vomit.\" Long-continued success and prosperity produces often a sort of intoxication in a nation.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah19:15VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTNeither shall there be any work for Egypt, which the head or tail, branch or rush, may do.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 15. - Neither shall there be, etc. Translate, And there shall be for Egypt no work in which both the head and the tail, both the palm branch and the rush, may (conjointly) work.

Shall Egypt be like unto women (comp. Jeremiah 51:30). So Xerxes said of his fighting men at Salamis: \"My men have become women\" (Herod., 8:88). Because of the shaking of the hand of the Lord (comp. Isaiah 11:15 and Isaiah 30:32). The Egyptians would scarcely recognize Jehovah as the Author of their calamities, but it would none the less be his hand which punished them.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah19:17VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the land of Judah shall be a terror unto Egypt, every one that maketh mention thereof shall be afraid in himself, because of the counsel of the LORD of hosts, which he hath determined against it.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 17. - The land of Judah shall be a terror unto Egypt. In Manasseh's reign Judaea became subject to Assyria (2 Chronicles 33:11; G. Smith, 'Eponym Canon,' p. 139, 1. 13), and had to take part in the hostile expeditions, which both Esarhaddon and his son, Asshurbanipal, conducted against Egypt. Egypt had to keep her eye on Judaea continually, to see when danger was approaching her. If is not likely that Isaiah's prophecies caused the \"terror\" here spoken cf. Every one that maketh mention thereof shall be afraid; rather, when any one maketh mention thereof, they shall turn to him in fear. The very mention of Judaea by any one shall cause fear, because they will expect to hear that an expedition has started, or is about to start, from that country. Because of the counsel of the Lord of hosts. This is how Isaiah views the Assyrian attacks on Egypt, not how the Egyptians viewed them. The fear felt by the Egyptians was not a religious fear. They simply dreaded the Assyrian armies, and Judaea as the country from which the expeditions seemed to issue.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah19:18VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTIn that day shall five cities in the land of Egypt speak the language of Canaan, and swear to the LORD of hosts; one shall be called, The city of destruction.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 18-22. - THE TURNING OF EGYPT TO JEHOVAH. The chastisement of the Egyptians shall be followed, after a while, by a great change. Influences from Canaan shall penetrate Egypt (ver. 18), an altar shall be raised in her midst to Jehovah (ver. 19), and she herself shall cry to him for succor (ver. 20) and be delivered (ver. 20). Egypt shall even become a part of Jehovah's kingdom, shall \"know him,\" and serve him with sacrifice and oblation (ver. 21), and perform her vows to Jehovah, and have her supplications heard by him, and be converted and healed (ver. 22). Verse 18. - In that day. Not really the day of vengeance, but that which, in the prophet's mind, is most closely connected with it - the day of restitution - whereof he has spoken perpetually (Isaiah 1:25-27; Isaiah 2:2-4; Isaiah 4:2-6; Isaiah 6:13, etc.). The two are parts of one scheme of things, and belong in the prophet's mind to one time. Shall five cities in the land of Egypt speak the language of Canaan. It is quite true, as Mr. Cheyne remarks, that the Eastern Delta was from a very early date continually more and more Semitized by an influx of settlers from Palestine, and that Egyptian literature bears strong marks of this linguistic influence. But this is scarcely what the prophet intends to speak about. He is not interested in philology. What he means is that there will be an appreciable influx into Egypt of Palestinian ideas, thoughts, and sentiments. \"Five\" is probably used as a \"round\" number. The first manifest fulfillment of the prophecy was at the foundation of Alexandria, when the Jews were encouraged to become settlers by the concession of important privileges (Josephus, 'Contr. Ap.,' 2:4), and where they ultimately became the predominant element in the population, amounting, according to Philo ('In Flaec.,' § 6), to nearly a million souls. The next great Palestinian influx was under Ptolemy YI. (Philometor), when Onias fled from Palestine with a number of his partisans, and obtained permission to erect a Jewish temple near Heliopelis. The site of this temple is probably marked by the ruins at Tel-el-Yahoudeh ('Quarterly Statement' of Palest. Expl. Fund for July, 1880, pp. 137-139). It seems to have been a center to a number of Jewish communities in the neighborhood. In this double way Jehovah became known to Egypt before Christianity. A Christian Church was early established in Alexandria, possibly by St. Mark. Swear to the Lord of hosts; i.e. \"swear fidelity to him.\" One shall be called, The city of destruction. Some manuscripts read 'Ir-ha-Kheres, \"City of the Sun,\" for 'Ir-ha-heres, \"City of Destruction,\" in which case the reference would be plainly to Heliopelis, which was in the immediate neighborhood of Tel-el-Yahoudeh, and which in the Ptolemaic period may well have fallen under Jewish influence. Even if 'Ir-ha-heres stand as the true reading, the name may still have been given with allusion to Heliopolis, the prophet intending to say, \"That city which was known as the City of the Sun-God shall become known as the City of Destruction of the Sun-God and of idolatrous worship generally.\" That Heliopolis did actually fall under Jewish influence in the Ptolemaic period appears from a remarkable passage of Polyhistor, who says of the Exodus and the passage of the Red Sea, \"The Memphites say that Moses, being well acquainted with the district, watched the ebb of the tide, and so led the people across the dry bed of the sea; but they of Heliopolis affirm that the king, at the head of a vast force, and having the sacred animals also with him, pursued after the Jews, because they were carrying away with them the riches which they had borrowed from the Egyptians. Then, \"they say,\" the voice of God commanded Moses to smite the sea with his rod, and divide it; and Moses, when he heard, touched the water with it, and so the sea parted asunder, and the host marched through on dry ground.\" Such an account of the Exodus would scarcely have been given by Egyptians unless they were three parts Hebraized.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah19:19VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTIn that day shall there be an altar to the LORD in the midst of the land of Egypt, and a pillar at the border thereof to the LORD.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 19. - There shall be an altar to the Lord. An altar to the Lord was undoubtedly erected by Onias in the temple which he obtained leave to build from Ptolemy Philometor. Josephus says that he persuaded Ptolemy by showing him this passage of Isaiah ('Ant. Jud.,' 13:3; 'Bell. Jud.,' 7:10). And a pillar at the border thereof. It is not clear that any \"pillar\" was ever actually erected. The erection of pillars for religious purposes was forbidden by the Law (Deuteronomy 16:22). But this would be a pillar of witness (Genesis 31:52), and would mark that the land was Jehovah's. Dr. Kay suggests that \"the Jewish synagogue first, and afterwards the Christian Church at Alexandria, standing like a lofty obelisk, with the name of Jehovah inscribed upon it, at the entrance of Egypt,\" sufficiently fulfilled the prophecy.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah19:20VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd it shall be for a sign and for a witness unto the LORD of hosts in the land of Egypt: for they shall cry unto the LORD because of the oppressors, and he shall send them a saviour, and a great one, and he shall deliver them.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 20. - It shall be for a sign. The outward tokens of Jehovah-worship shall witness to God that he has in Egypt now a covenant people, and he will deal with them accordingly. He shall send them a savior, and a great one. This does not seem to point to any earthly deliverer, but to the Savior from the worst of all oppressors, sin and Satan, whom they will need equally with the rest of his people.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah19:21VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the LORD shall be known to Egypt, and the Egyptians shall know the LORD in that day, and shall do sacrifice and oblation; yea, they shall vow a vow unto the LORD, and perform it.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 21. - The Lord shall be known; rather, shall make himself known, as in Ezekiel 20:5, 9; by answering prayer, by spiritual influences, and the like. The Egyptians shall know the Lord (comp. Jeremiah 31:34, \"They shall all know me from the least of them unto the greatest\"). And shall do sacrifice and oblation; rather, shall serve with sacrifice and oblation. The bulk of the Jews settled in Egypt, together with their Egyptian proselytes, went up year by year to worship Jehovah at Jerusalem, and make offerings to him there (see Zechariah 14:16-19). Christian Egypt worshipped God with sacrifice and oblation in the same sense as the rest of the Church (Malachi 1:11).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah19:22VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the LORD shall smite Egypt: he shall smite and heal it: and they shall return even to the LORD, and he shall be intreated of them, and shall heal them.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 22. - And Jehovah shall smite Egypt, smiting and healing; i.e. Jehovah shall indeed \"smite Egypt,\" as already prophesied (vers. 1-16), but it shall be with a merciful object, in order, after smiting, to \"heal.\" His smiting shall induce them to \"return\" to him, and when they return he will forgive and save (comp. Zephaniah 3:8, 9; Jeremiah 12:14-16). Egypt was a Christian country from the third century to the seventh; and the Coptic Church (though very corrupt) still remains, knowing Jehovah, and offering the holy oblation of the Christian altar continually.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah19:23VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTIn that day shall there be a highway out of Egypt to Assyria, and the Assyrian shall come into Egypt, and the Egyptian into Assyria, and the Egyptians shall serve with the Assyrians.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 23-25. - UNION BETWEEN EGYPT, ASSYRIA, AND ISRAEL. Assyria's conversion to God will follow or accompany that of Egypt. The two will be joined with Israel in an intimate connection, Israel acting as the intermediary. There will be uninterrupted communication, common worship, and the common blessing of God extending over the three. Verse 23. - Shall there be a highway. The phraseology resembles that of Isaiah 11:16; but the purpose is different. Then the \"highway\" was to facilitate the return of the Israelites to their own land. Now the object is perfectly free communication between the three peoples. The Egyptians shall serve with the Assyrians. \"Shall serve\" means \"shall worship\" (see ver. 21). The \"Assyrians\" represent the inhabitants of the Mesopotamian regions generally. As, from the time of Alexander, Hebrew influence extended itself largely over Egypt, so, even from an earlier date, it began to be felt in the Mesopotamian countries. The transplantation of the ten tribes, or a considerable portion of them, into Upper Mesopotamia and Media, was the commencement of a diffusion of Hebrew ideas through those regions. The captivity of Judah still further impressed these ideas on the native races. Great numbers of Jews did not return from the Captivity, but remained in the countries and cities to which they had been trans ported, particularly in Babylon (Josephus, 'Ant. Jud.,' 11:1). The policy of the Seleucid princes was to establish Jewish colonies in all their great cities. In the time between Alexander and the birth of our Lord, the Hebrew community was re cognized as composed of three great sections - the Palestinian, the Egyptian, and the Syro-Babylonian. Constant communication was maintained between the three branches. Ecclesiastical regulations, framed at Jerusalem, were transmitted to Alexandria and Babylon, while collections made in all parts of Egypt and Mesopotamia for the temple service were annually carried to the Palestinian capital by trusty persons. It is thus quite reasonable to regard as an \"initial stage in the fulfillment of this prophecy\" the state of things existing at this period (Kay). The more complete fulfillment was doubtless after Pentecost, when Christianity was preached and established in Egypt and Libya on the one hand, in Parthia, and Media, and Elam, and Mesopotamia on the other (Acts 2:9, 10).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah19:24VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTIn that day shall Israel be the third with Egypt and with Assyria, even a blessing in the midst of the land:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 24. - In that day shall Israel be the third; rather, a third. Not third in rank, for ver. 25 shows that she would retain a pre-eminence, but the common intermediary, brining the other two together. A blessing in the midst of the land; rather, in the midst of the earth. Judaean monotheism, upheld by God's people in Palestine, Egypt, and Mesopotamia, would be a blessing, not only to those three countries, but to the world at large. So, and still more, would Christianity.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah19:25VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWhom the LORD of hosts shall bless, saying, Blessed be Egypt my people, and Assyria the work of my hands, and Israel mine inheritance.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 25. - Whom the Lord of hosts bless; rather, forasmuch as the Lord of hosts hath blessed him. \"Him\" must be understood collectively, of the threefold Israel, spread through the three countries, which all partake of the blessing. The three countries are able to be a blessing to the world at large, because God's blessing rests upon them. Egypt my people. Egypt's great work in Jewish times, by which she became a blessing to the world, was her translation of the Hebrew Scriptures into Greek, commanded by Egyptian kings, and executed at Alexandria, the Egyptian capital. Neo-Platonism certainly owed much to this source. Stoicism probably something. Assyria the work of my hands. Assyria did no such work as Egypt. Neither the Targum of Onkelos nor the Babylonian Talmud can be compared for a moment with the Septuagint. Still the Mesopotamian Jews were a blessing to their neighbors. They kept alive in the East the notion of one true and spiritual God; they elevated the tone of men's thoughts; they were a perpetual protest against idolatry, with all its horrors. They, no doubt, prepared the way for that acceptance of Christianity by large masses of the population in Syria, Mesopotamia, Babylonia, and even in Persia, of which we have evidence in the ecclesiastical history of the first seven centuries.

It is questioned whether the title can be regarded as Isaiah's, or as properly belonging to the work, and it is suggested that it is rather a heading invented by a collector who brought together into a volume such prophecies of Isaiah as were known to him, the collection being a much smaller one than that which was made ultimately. In favor of this view it is urgedNEWLINENEWLINE(1) that the prophecies, as we have them, do not all \"concern Judah and Jerusalem;\"NEWLINENEWLINE(2) that there is a mistake in the title, which Isaiah could not have made, none of the prophecies belonging to the reign of Uzziah. But it may be answered, that, in the scriptural sense, all and Jerusalem, prophecy \"concerns Judah and Jerusalem,\" i.e. the people and city of God; and, further, that it is quite impossible to prove that no part of the \"vision\" was seen in the reign of Uzziah. There are no means of knowing whether Isaiah collected his prophecies into a volume himself or whether the collection was the work of others. In either case, the existing title must be regarded as designed for the entire work. All the earlier prophecies - those of Hosea, Joel, Amos, Obadiah, Micah, Nahum, and Zephaniah - have some title introducing them. Verse 1. - The vision (comp. Obadiah 1:1; Nahum 1:1). The term is probably used in a collective sense, but is also intended to suggest the intrinsic unity of the entire body of prophecies put forth by Isaiah. As prophets were originally called \"seers\" (1 Samuel 9:9), so prophecy was called \"vision;\" and this latter use continued long after the other (comp. 1 Chronicles 17:15; Ezekiel 12:27; Daniel 9:23; Obadiah 1:1, etc.). Isaiah the son of Amoz (comp. Isaiah 2:1; Isaiah 13:1; Isaiah 37:2; etc.; 2 Kings 20:1; 2 Chronicles 32:32). The signification of the name Isaiah is \"the salvation of Jehovah.\" The name Amen (Amots) is not to be confused with Amos ('Amos), who seems to have been a contemporary (Amos 1:1). Concerning Judah and Jerusalem. The prophecies of Isaiah concern primarily the kingdom of Judah, not that of Israel. They embrace a vast variety of nations and countries (see especially Isaiah 13, 15. - 21, 23, 47.); but these nations and countries are spoken of \"only because of the relation in which they stand to Judah and Jerusalem\" (Kay), or at any rate to the people of God, symbolized under those names. Jerusalem occupies a prominent place in the prophecies (see Isaiah 1:8, 21; Isaiah 3:16-26; Isaiah 4:3-6; Isaiah 29. 1-8; 31:4-9, etc.). In the days of Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah. Uzziah (or Azariah, as he is sometimes called) reigned fifty-two years - probably from B.C. 811 to B.C. 759; Jotham sixteen years - from B.C. 759 to B.C. 743; Ahaz also sixteen years - from B.C. 743 to B.C. 727; and Hezekiah twenty-nine years - from B.C. 727 to B.C. 698. Isaiah probably prophesied only in the later years of Uzziah, say from B.C. 760; but as he certainly continued his prophetical career tin Sennacherib's invasion of Judaea (Isaiah 37:5), which was not earlier than B.C. 705, he must have exercised the prophet's office for at least fifty-six years. The lowest possible estimate of the duration of his ministry is forty-seven years - from the last year of Uzziah, B.C. 759, to the fourteenth of Hezekiah (Isaiah 38:5). The highest known to us is sixty-four years - from the fourth year before Uzziah's death ( B.C. 762) to the last year of Hezekiah ( B.C. 698).

The groundwork of Isaiah's entire prophecy is Judah's defection from God. God's people have sinned, done amiss, dealt wickedly. The hour of vengeance approaches. Punishment has begun, and will go on, continually increasing in severity. National repentance would avert God's judgments, but the nation will not repeat. God's vengeance will fall, and by it a remnant will be purified, and return to God, and be his true people. In the present section the indictment is laid. Judah's sins are called to her remembrance. Verse 2. - Hear, O heavens, and give ear, O earth. \"A grave and magnificent exorilium! All nature is invoked to hear Jehovah make complaint of the ingratitude of his people\" (Rosenmüller). The invocation is cast in the same form with that so common in Deuteronomy (Deuteronomy 4:26; 30:19; 31:28; 32:1), and seems to indicate familiarity with that book. The idea extends widely among sacred and other poets (see Psalm 1:3, 4; Micah 6:1, 2; Aesch., 'P. V.,' 11. 88-92). The Lord hath spoken; rather, the Lord (literally, Jehovah) speaketh (so Lowth, Cheyne, and Gesenius). The speech of Jehovah follows in vers. 2, 3. I have nourished and brought up children; literally, (my) sons I have made great and high; i.e. I have raised Israel to greatness and exalted him among the nations. Notwithstanding their disobedience, God still acknowledges them as his \"sons.\" They have rebelled against me. The verb used is generally rendered in our version \"transgressed\" (see Jeremiah 3:13; Hosea 7:13; Amos 4:4); but it may also have the stronger sense here assigned it. Lowth translates, \"revolted from me;\" Gesenius, \"fallen away from me;\" Cheyne, \"broken away from me.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah1:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe ox knoweth his owner, and the ass his master's crib: but Israel doth not know, my people doth not consider.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 3. - The ox... the ass. The ox and the ass are probably selected as the least intelligent of domesticated animals (so Jerome, Rosenmüller, and Gesenius). Yet even they recognize their owner or master. Jeremiah contrasts the brutish stupidity of Israel with the wise instinct of animals that have not been domesticated, as the stork, the turtle-dove, the crane, and the swallow (Jeremiah 8:7). Israel doth not know; i.e. does not acknowledge its Master and Owner, pays him no respect, does not recognize him as either Owner or Master. My people. Compare the formula, so frequent in Exodus, \"Let my people go\" (Exodus 7:16; 8:1, 20; 9:1, etc.). Israel was God's people by election (Genesis 15:13), by covenant (Exodus 19:5-8; Exodus 24:3-8), by pardoning grace (Exodus 33:12-17). Despite all their backslidings, he had not yet cast them off. They are still \"his people\" in Isaiah from first to last, standing in contrast with \"the nations, \"or \"the Gentiles, \"among whom they are to be \"set as a sign\" (Isaiah 66:19). Doth net consider. Gesenius translates, \"doth not consider thereof;\" Cheyne, \"is without understanding.\" Bishop Lowth retains the words of the Authorized Version. The meaning would seem to be, \"My people doth not consider me, cloth not reflect on my relation to them as Lord and Master.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah1:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAh sinful nation, a people laden with iniquity, a seed of evildoers, children that are corrupters: they have forsaken the LORD, they have provoked the Holy One of Israel unto anger, they are gone away backward.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 4. - Ah sinful nation. These are the words of Isaiah, not of Jehovah. The prophet, having delivered God's message in vers. 2 and 3, proceeds to impress and enforce it on the people by remarks of his own. He begins with a lamentation over their wickedness and impenitence; \"Ah sinful nation!\" or \"Alas for the sinful nation! \"the nation called to be holy (Exodus 19:6; Leviticus 20:26, etc.), but sunk in sin and wickedness. How sad their condition! How almost hopeless! Laden with iniquity; literally, heavy with guilt. But our version well expresses the sense. As the psalmist says, \"My sins have gone up over my head, and are like a sore burden, toe heavy for me to bear\" (Psalm 38:4; cf. Matthew 11:28). A seed of evil-doers. Not descendants of evil-doors, but \"an evil-doing seed, \"or \"race\" (σπέρμα πονηρόν, LXX.; comp. Isaiah 14:20; Isaiah 61:9; Isaiah 65:23). Children that are corrupters; literally, sons that do corruptly. It is not their corrupting of others, though that might follow, but the corruption that was in themselves, which is spoken cf. The corruption was both moral and doctrinal (see ver. 21). In corroboration of the fact, see 2 Chronicles 27:2. They have forsaken the Lord. Not by renouncing his worship, which they still continued (see vers. 11-15), but by reducing it to a formality. The people \"honored him with their lips, while their hearts were far from him\" (Isaiah 29:13). They have provoked to anger; rather, despised (Revised Version), or scorched (Kay, Cheyne), or rejected with disdain (Lowth), in allusion to their disobeying his commandments (see vers. 21-23). The Holy One of Israel. This title of God is a favorite one with Isaiah (see Isaiah 5:19, 24; Isaiah 10:17, 20; Isaiah 12:6; Isaiah 17:7; Isaiah 29:19, 23; Isaiah 30:11, 12, 15; Isaiah 31:1; Isaiah 37:23; Isaiah 41:14, 16, 20; Isaiah 43:3, 14; Isaiah 45:11; Isaiah 49:7; Isaiah 54:5; Isaiah 55:5; Isaiah 60:9, 14), and is very rarely used by the other sacred writers. We find it thrice in the Psalms (Psalm 71:22; Psalm 78:41; Psalm 89:18); once in Kings (2 Kings 19:22), but then in the mouth of Isaiah; twice in Jeremiah (Jeremiah 1:29; 51:5); and once in Ezekiel (Ezekiel 39:7). According to Isaiah's conception of God, holiness is the most essential element of his nature (see Isaiah 6:3, 5, 7). They are gone away backward; literally, they are estranged backwards; or, as Bishop Lowth paraphrases, \"they are estranged from him; they have turned their back upon him.\" Instead of looking to God, and following after him, they \"followed a multitude to do evil (Exodus 23:2).\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah1:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWhy should ye be stricken any more? ye will revolt more and more: the whole head is sick, and the whole heart faint.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 5. - Why should ye, etc.?

The Authorized Version does not express the sense, which is that suffering must follow sin - that if they still revolt, they must still be smitten for it - why, then, will they do so? Compare Ezekiel's \"Why will ye die, O house of Israel?\" (Ezekiel 18:31). The whole head... the whole heart. Mr. Cheyne translates, \"Every head... every heart;\" but Lowth, Gesenius, and Ewald agree with the Authorized Version. The prophet personifies Israel, and means to say that the whole head of the nation is diseased, its whole heart faint, or \"prostrate with languor\" (Kay). The head and heart represent respectively the intellectual and moral natures.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah1:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFrom the sole of the foot even unto the head there is no soundness in it; but wounds, and bruises, and putrifying sores: they have not been closed, neither bound up, neither mollified with ointment.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 6. - From the sole of the foot even unto the head (comp. Job 2:7). From top to bottom, the body corporate is diseased throughout - there is no soundness in it (cf. Psalm 38:3, 7) - all is one wound, one livid bruise, one festering sore. Note the use of the singular number in the original. They have not been closed; literally, they have not been pressed; which is explained to mean (Aben Ezra, Kay) that they have not had the matter formed by suppuration pressed out of them. Neither bound up; i.e. not bandaged, Neither mollified with ointment; rather, with oil. On the treatment of wounds and ulcers with oil m ancient times, see 'Hippocrat., De Ulceri. bus,' § 4; Galen., 'De Compos. Medic.,' § 2; and comp. Luke 10:34. Recent medical science has revived the practice, and wounds of all kinds are now frequently treated with nothing but carbolic oil. The general sentiment of the entire passage is that there has been no medical treatment of the wounds of any kind; they have been left to themselves, to spread corruption over the whole body - no attempt has been made to cure them.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah1:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTYour country is desolate, your cities are burned with fire: your land, strangers devour it in your presence, and it is desolate, as overthrown by strangers.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 7. - Your country is desolate. Metaphor is now dropped, and the prophet describes in strong but simple language the judgments of God, which have already followed the sins of the nation. First of all, their land is \"a desolation.\" It has been recently ravaged by an enemy; the towns have been burnt, the crops devoured. There is nothing to determine who the enemy had been. Knobel supposes the Edomites and Philistines, who invaded Judaea in the time of Ahaz (2 Chronicles 28:17, 18), to be intended; Rosenmüller suggests the Israelites under Amaziah (2 Chronicles 25:21-24); while Mr. Cheyne supposes the devastation to have been wrought by the Assyrians under Sargon. If we could be assured that the prophecies of Isaiah are arranged in chronological order, we should either have to accept Rosenmüller's view, or to suppose some invasion of Judaea to have taken place in the later years of Uzziah of which no mention is made by the authors of Kings and Chronicles; but it is impossible to be certain on what principle Isaiah's prophecies are arranged. The mention of \"strangers\" is in favor of the enemy having been actual foreigners, and therefore not the Israelites. Your cities are burned with fire. The common fate of cities taken in war. In the Assyrian sculptures we often see the torch applied to them. Your land. Mr. Cheyne translates, \"your tillage.\" Adamah means \"soil\" or \"ground\" generally; but here no doubt denotes the ground which bore crops. Strangers devour it; i.e. \"foreigners\" others than the sons of the soil - not necessarily persons of a different race, but still probably such persons. In your presence; before your eyes, as you look on - an aggravation of the affliction. It is desolate, as overthrown by strangers; literally, it is a desolation, like an overthrow by strangers. The near approach to repetition displeases moderns, who conjectureNEWLINENEWLINE(1) that zarim, strangers, has another meaning, and should be here translated by \"inundation\" or \"deluge\" (Aben Ezra, Michaelis, Lowth); orNEWLINENEWLINE(2) that it is a wrong reading, and should Be altered into sodim, a word not very different (Ewald, Cheyne). But \"the return to words whose sounds are yet lingering in the ear\" is characteristic of ancient writing, and a favorite practice of Isaiah's (Kay). The translation of the Authorized Version may therefore stand.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah1:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the daughter of Zion is left as a cottage in a vineyard, as a lodge in a garden of cucumbers, as a besieged city.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 8. - The daughter of Zion. Not \"the faithful Church\" (Kay), but the city of Jerusalem, which is thus personified. Comp. Isaiah 47:1, 5, where Babylon is called the \"daughter of the Chaldeans;\" and Lamentations 1:6; Lamentations 2:1, 4, 8, 10, where the phrase here used is repeated in the same sense. More commonly it designates the people without the city (Lamentations 2:13; Lamentations 4:22; Micah 3:8, 10, 13; Zephaniah 3:14; Zechariah 2:10; Zechariah 9:9, etc.). As a cottage; rather, as a booth (Revised Version; see Leviticus 23:42). Vineyards required to be watched for a few weeks only as the fruit began to ripen; and the watchers, or keepers, built themselves, therefore, mere \"booths\" for their protection (Job 27:18). These were frail, solitary dwellings - very forlorn, very helpless. Such was now Jerusalem. As a lodge in a garden of cucumbers. Cucumber-gardens required watching throughout the season, i.e. from spring to autumn, and their watcher needed a more solid edifice than a booth. Hence such gardens had \"lodges\" in them, i.e. permanent huts or sheds, such as those still seen in Palestine (Tristram's 'Natural History of Palestine,' p. 442). As a besieged city. Though not yet besieged, Jerusalem is as if besieged - isolated, surrounded by waste tracts, threatened.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah1:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTExcept the LORD of hosts had left unto us a very small remnant, we should have been as Sodom, and we should have been like unto Gomorrah.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 9. - Except the Lord of hosts had left unto us a very small remnant, we should have been as Sodom. Lowth and Cheyne prefer to divide the two clauses differently, and to translate, \"Except the Lord of hosts had left us a remnant, within a little we should have been like Sodom.\" The \"remnant\" is that of the few godly men who still inhabit Jerusalem. The comparison of Jerusalem with Sodom is made again in Isaiah 3:9, and is carried out at some length by Ezekiel (Ezekiel 16:44-57). It implies a condition of extreme depravity.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah1:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHear the word of the LORD, ye rulers of Sodom; give ear unto the law of our God, ye people of Gomorrah.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 10-15. - THE PEOPLE'S PLEA NO EXCUSE, BUT AN AGGRAVATION OF THEIR GUILT. The prophet supposes the people, by the mouth of their rulers, to meet the charge of rebellion with an appeal to the fact that they maintain all the outward ordinances of religion, as required by the Lawn and are therefore blameless. This draws from him a burst of indignant eloquence, which the Holy Spirit directs him to put, mainly, into the mouth of God (vers. 11-15), denouncing such a pretence of religion as an aggravation of their sin, and characterizing their whole worship as an \"abomination.\" Verse 10. - Hear the word of the Lord; i.e. \"Do not speak to no purpose, but hear.\" The rulers are supposed to have begun their plea, but the prophet stops them. Ye rulers of Sodom. Having said in the preceding verse how nearly Jerusalem had suffered the fate of Sodom and Gomorrah, the writer grows more bold, and proceeds to give Jerusalem the obnoxious names. Her \"rulers, \"literally, judges (katsin in Hebrew corresponding to kadi in Arabic), are \"rulers of Sodom;\" her people are the \"people of Gomorrah.\" There is as much wickedness, though it may be not the same wickedness, in \"the daughter of Zion\" at the existing time, as in the cities of the plain when God destroyed them. The law of our God. Not the Levitical Law, though the word used has generally that sense, but the \"instruction\" or \"direction\" that was about to be uttered (comp. Psalm 78:1; and see below, Isaiah 2:3 and Isaiah 51:4). See Mr. Cheyne's note on the passage.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah1:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTTo what purpose is the multitude of your sacrifices unto me? saith the LORD: I am full of the burnt offerings of rams, and the fat of fed beasts; and I delight not in the blood of bullocks, or of lambs, or of he goats.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 11. - To what purpose is the multitude of your sacrifices unto me? Cui bono? What good end do they serve? \"Thinkest thou that I will eat the flesh of bulls, and drink the blood of goats? \"(Psalm 1:13). God \"delights not in burnt offerings.\" From the time of Samuel he had declared, \"Behold, to obey is better then sacrifice, and to hearken than the fat of rams\" (1 Samuel 15:22). David had said of him, \"Sacrifice and meat offering thou wouldest not; burnt offerings and sacrifice for sin hast thou not required\" (Psalm 40:8, 9); and again, \"I will not reprove thee because of thy sacrifices, or for thy burnt offerings, because they were not always before me. I will take no bullock out of thy house, nor he-goat out of thy folds; for all the beasts of the forest are mine, and so are the cattle upon a thousand hills\" (Psalm 50:8-10). Not, of course, that either David or Isaiah desired to abolish sacrifice, or had any commission so to do; but they were, both of them, anxious to impress on men that sacrifice, by itself, was nothing - that self-dedication, self-renunciation, true devotion of the heart, with its necessary concomitant obedience, must accompany sacrifice, for God to be pleased therewith. The sacrifices of a people such as is described in vers. 21-23 could not but be an offence to him. Saith the Lord. The phrase employed is unusual, and almost confined to Isaiah, occurring elsewhere only in Psalm 12:5. Isaiah uses it again in ver. 18, and also in Isaiah 33:10; Isaiah 41:21; and Isaiah 66:9. It is explained to be emphatic, implying that this is what God says, and will say, concerning the matter in hand, once and forever (Kay). I am full of the burnt offerings of rams; rather, I am overfull, satiated, wearied with them. Barns formed a part of the required sacrifice on all great occasions, as at the Passover (Numbers 28:19), at the Feast of Weeks (Numbers 28:27), at the Feast of Tabernacles (Numbers 29:13, 17, 20, 23, 26, 29, 32, 36), at the Feast of Trumpets (Numbers 29:2), and on the great Day of Atonement (Numbers 29:8). They were commanded as the sole sacrifice for a trespass offering (Leviticus 5:16, 18). Under David were offered on one occasion \"a thousand rams\" (1 Chronicles 29:21); and the occasions where seven rams formed the legitimate sacrifice were many. Unaccompanied by a proper frame of mind, each such offering was an offence to God, displeased him, wearied him. The fat of fed beasts. The fat was always regarded, both by the Hebrews and the Greeks, as especially suitable for sacrifice. It was burnt upon the altar in every case, even where the greater part of the victim was consumed as food (see Leviticus 1:8, 12; Leviticus 3:3, 10, etc.; note particularly the expression in Leviticus 3:16, \"All the fat is the Lord's\"). \"Fed beasts\" are those which were kept separate in stalls or sheds for some time before the sacrifice, and given food in which there was nothing\" unclean.\" The Paschal lambs were required to be thus separated and fed for four days (Exodus 12:3, 6). I delight not in the blood. The blood, \"which is the life\" (Leviticus 17:14), was to be sprinkled on the altar in every sacrifice of a victim. This sprinkling was of the very essence of the sacrifice (Leviticus 1:5; Leviticus 3:2, 8, 13; Leviticus 4:6, 17, 25, 30, etc.). Bullocks... lambs... he-goats. These, together with rams, constituted all the sacrificial beasts of the Hebrews.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah1:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWhen ye come to appear before me, who hath required this at your hand, to tread my courts?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 12. - When ye come to appear before me. Mr. Cheyne translates, \"to see my face;\" but most other commentators (Gesenius, Delitzsch, Ewald, Kay) regard the phrase used as equivalent to that employed in Exodus 23:17; Exodus 34:23; Deuteronomy 16:16; and the passage as referring to that attendance in the temple at the three great annual festivals, which was required of all adult male Israelites. The requirement of the Law was still observed in the letter, but not in the spirit. They came with no true religious object. Hence the question which follows: Who hath required this at your hand, to tread my courts? This was not what God had enjoined - a mere bodily attendance, a trampling of his courts with their feet, when their hearts were far from him.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah1:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBring no more vain oblations; incense is an abomination unto me; the new moons and sabbaths, the calling of assemblies, I cannot away with; it is iniquity, even the solemn meeting.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 13. - Bring no more vain oblations. The command is net \"Bring no more oblations, \"as though the daily oblation was to cease; but \"bring no more oblations that are vain ones, \"i.e. empty and unreal - mere forms, without the proper corresponding spirit. The \"oblation\" spoken of is the minchah, or \"meat offering,\" cf. Leviticus 2:1-11; Numbers 28:12-31, which was a cake of fine flour mingled with oil, and generally had incense joined with it, which explains the nexus of this clause with the following one. Incense is an abomination unto me. God had commanded the use of incense in worship, as he had commanded burnt offerings and oblations (Exodus 30:1-8, 34-38; Leviticus 2:2; Leviticus 16:12, 13). But incense symbolized prayer (Psalm 141:2); and if no heartfelt prayer accompanied its use, it was emptied of all its significance, and became hateful to God - a mere form, and consequently an \"abomination.\" The new moons and sabbaths, the calling of assemblies, I cannot away with. The weekly festival of the sabbath, the monthly one of the \"new moon, \"and the annual \"assemblies\" or \"solemn feasts\" (2 Chronicles 8:13), were the main occasions of Jewish worship. As at this time conducted, God could endure none of them; all were tainted with the prevalent unreality. The construction of the passage is highly rhetorical, and indicates great excitement of feeling. Kay translates it literally, \"New moon and sabbath, the calling of assemblies, I cannot - it is ungodliness - even the solemn meeting.\" The authors of the Revised Version also suppose an aposiopesis. The solemn meeting. The word thus translated is applied only to particular days in the great festival seasons, as to the eighth day of the Feast of Tabernacles (Leviticus 23:36; Numbers 29:35; Nehemiah 8:18), and the seventh day of the Passover (Deuteronomy 16:8), or else to days specially appointed for religious services by civil authority (2 Kings 10:20; 2 Chronicles 7:9; Joel 1:14; Joel 2:15). The meaning thus is, that even the very highest 'occasions of religious worship were abused by the Israelites of the time, and made an offence to God.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah1:14VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTYour new moons and your appointed feasts my soul hateth: they are a trouble unto me; I am weary to bear them.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 14. - Your new moons. (For the ceremonies to be observed at the opening of each month, see Numbers 28:11-15.) Your appointed feasts. The \"appointed feasts\" are the great festival-times - the Feast of Unleavened Bread, the Feast of Weeks, and the Feast of Tabernacles. They do not include the sabbath or the \"new moon, \"with which they are, both here and elsewhere (1 Chronicles 23:31; 2 Chronicles 31:3), contrasted. They are a trouble unto me; literally, an encumbrance (see Deuteronomy 1:12).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah1:15VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd when ye spread forth your hands, I will hide mine eyes from you: yea, when ye make many prayers, I will not hear: your hands are full of blood.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 15. - I will hide mine eyes, etc. A time comes when the wicked are alarmed, and seek to turn to God; but it is too late. \"Then shall they call upon me, but I will not answer; they shall seek me early, but they shall not find me\" (Proverbs 1:28). When ye make many prayers; literally, multiply prayer. Full of blood (comp. ver. 21). Actual bloodshed may be pointed at, as the murder of Zechariah (2 Chronicles 24:21), and the fate which befell Isaiah himself, according to the tradition, would seem to show. But cruelty and oppression, producing poverty and wretchedness, and tending to shorten life, are no doubt also included (comp. Micah 3:10, 11). These were the special sins of the time (see vers. 17, 23).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah1:16VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWash you, make you clean; put away the evil of your doings from before mine eyes; cease to do evil;VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 16-20. - THE REQUIREMENT OF GOD - AMENDMENT OF LIFE. God, having put aside the worthless plea of outward religiousness made by his people, goes on to declare, by the mouth of his prophet, what he requires. First, in general terms (ver. 16), and then with distinct specification (ver. 17), he calls on them to amend their ways, both negatively (\"cease to do evil\") and positively (\"learn to do well\"). If they will really amend, then he assures them of forgiveness and favor; if they refuse and continue their rebellion, the sword will devour them. Verse 16. - Wash you, make you clean. The analogy of sin to defilement, and of washing to cleansing from sin, has been felt among men universally wherever there has been any sense of sin. Outward purification by water has been constantly made use of as typical of the recovery of inward purity. Hence the numerous washings of the Levitical Law (Exodus 29:4; Leviticus 1:9, 13; Numbers 19:7, 8, 19; Deuteronomy 21:6; Deuteronomy 23:11; etc.); hence the ablutions of the priests in Egypt (Herod., 2:37); hence the appropriateness of the rite of baptism; hence the symbolical washing of hands to free from complicity in blood-guiltiness (Matthew 27:24). \"Wash you, make you clean, \"could not be misunderstood by the Israelites; they would know that it was a requirement to \"wash their hands in innocency\" (Psalm 26:6; Psalm 73:13), even apart from what follows. Put away the evil of your doings from before mine eyes. Not \"hide it, \"for that was impossible; but remove it altogether - in other words, \"cease from it.\" \"Cast off all the works of darkness;\" get rid of evil, to begin with. So much is negative.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah1:17VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTLearn to do well; seek judgment, relieve the oppressed, judge the fatherless, plead for the widow.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 17. - Learn to do well. Now comes the positive; first, in the general form\" learn,\" etc.; which resembles the apostle's \"Put on the armor of light\" (Romans 13:12). Then follow the particulars. Seek judgment; or, seek out justice; i.e. endeavor to get justice done to all men; see that they \"have right.\" Relieve the oppressed. So the LXX., the Vulgate, the Syriac, and the Chaldean Versions. But the word translated \"oppressed\" is thought by many to mean \"oppressor\" (Kimchi, Gesenius, Cheyne). This is certainly its meaning in Psalm 71:4. Translate, tighten the oppressor; i.e. correct and chasten him. Judge the fatherless; rather, do justice to the orphan (Cheyne); see that he is not wronged - be his champion. Plead for the widow; i.e. plead her cause in the courts; or, if judge, and she have no advocate, lean towards her, as if her advocate. The widow and the orphan were taken under God's special protection from the time of Moses, and constantly commended to the tender care of the righteous (Exodus 22:22-24; Deuteronomy 10:18; Deuteronomy 24:17; Deuteronomy 27:19, etc.).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah1:18VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTCome now, and let us reason together, saith the LORD: though your sins be as scarlet, they shall be as white as snow; though they be red like crimson, they shall be as wool.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 18. - Come now, and let us reason together. God has from time to time permitted man to reason with him (Genesis 18:23-32; Exodus 4:1-17; Job 23:3-7; Micah 6:2); but it is difficult to see that there is any \"reasoning\" or \"controversy\" here. Mr. Cheyne translates, \"Let us bring our dispute to an end.\" Though your sins be as scarlet... like crimson; i.e. \"open, evident, glaring.\" Or there may be an allusion to their blood-guiltiness (see vers. 15, 19). They shall be as white as snow. Comp. Psalm 51:7, which is completely parallel, whether it was written before or after. There can be no better image of, purity than snow (comp. Job 9:30; Lamentations 4:7). As wool. A weaker illustration than the preceding one, but needed for the parallelism. (The resemblance of falling snow to wool is noted in Psalm 147:16.)NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah1:19VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTIf ye be willing and obedient, ye shall eat the good of the land:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 19. - If ye be willing and obedient. Rosenmüller explains this as equivalent to \"if ye be willing to obey\" (cf. Ezekiel 3:7); but perhaps it is better to give each verb its separate force: \"If you consent in your wills, and are also obedient in your actions\" (so Kay). Ye shall eat the good of the land; i.e. there shall be no invasion; strangers shall not devour your crops (see ver. 7); you shall consume them yourselves. \"The good of the land\" is a common expression for its produce (Genesis 45:18, 20; Ezra 9:12; Nehemiah 9:36; Jeremiah 2:7).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah1:20VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut if ye refuse and rebel, ye shall be devoured with the sword: for the mouth of the LORD hath spoken it.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 20. - If ye refuse and rebel; i.e. \"if ye neither consent in will, nor obey in act, \"antithetical to the two verbs in the first clause of ver. 19. Ye shall be devoured; or, ye shall be eaten. The same verb as in the latter clause of ver. 19. With the sword. The metaphor is not a common one, but occurs in Jeremiah (Jeremiah 2:30; Jeremiah 12:12; Jeremiah 46:10, 14) and Nahum (Nahum 2:13). The mouth of the Lord hath spoken it. A weighty ending, indicating the certainty of fulfillment, Jehovah, who cannot lie, has spoken; the result will assuredly follow.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah1:21VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHow is the faithful city become an harlot! it was full of judgment; righteousness lodged in it; but now murderers.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 21-23. - ISAIAH'S LAMENT OVER JERUSALEM. The exhortation to amendment has been made - the results have been set forth; the temporal reward has been promised; the temporal vengeance, unless they amend, threatened. Time must be allowed the people for the prophet's words to reach them, and do their work upon them, i.e. either soften or harden them. Meanwhile, Isaiah reflects on the condition of Jerusalem, and the unlikelihood of its rulers turning to God in consequence of his preaching. Verse 21. - How is the faithful city become an harlot! Not here an idolatress, but one that has left her first love, and turned to other attractions. Faithful once to her lord her spouse (Cant., passim), she has now cast him off - she is an adulterous wife, she no longer obeys or loves her husband. It was full of judgment; righteousness, etc. \"She that was full\" (Revised Version). Under Solomon (1 Kings 3:9-28) and again under Jehoshaphat (2 Chronicles 19:5-11). It is not clear when the systematic perversion of justice by the rulers began. Perhaps it originated in the latter part of Uzziah's reign, when the royal authority was weakened by being divided between Uzziah and Jotham (2 Chronicles 26:21). But now murderers (see the last note on ver. 15).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah1:22VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThy silver is become dross, thy wine mixed with water:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 22. - Thy silver is become dross. Primarily, \"thy great men have deteriorated.\" From pure silver, they have become mere dross, the vile refuse of the smelted ore, only fit to be cast away as worthless. But per-Imps there is some further reference to all that was once precious in Jerusalem; there had been a general deterioration - all the silver was now a debased metal of no value. Thy wine mixed with water. A parallelism; but (as so often happens) a weakened iteration of the preceding sentiment.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah1:23VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThy princes are rebellious, and companions of thieves: every one loveth gifts, and followeth after rewards: they judge not the fatherless, neither doth the cause of the widow come unto them.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 23. - Thy princes are rebellious; i.e. \"rebels against their true King, Jehovah.\" Companions of thieves. Leagued with those who are engaged in filching away the inheritance of the widow and the orphan by chicane in the law courts (see above, vers. 15-17; and compare the Homiletics on vers. 16-20). Gifts... rewards; i.e. \"bribes, \"given and taken on the condition of their perverting justice (comp. Jeremiah 22:17; Ezekiel 22:12; Micah 3:11; Micah 7:3). They judge not the fatherless, etc. They dismiss the orphan's complaint without hearing it, and are so noted for perversion of justice that the widow does not even bring her cause before them.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah1:24VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTTherefore saith the Lord, the LORD of hosts, the mighty One of Israel, Ah, I will ease me of mine adversaries, and avenge me of mine enemies:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 24-31. - THE DECLARATION OF GOD'S JUDGMENT. It is foreknown to God that Israel will not repent. He therefore fulminates his judgment; which, however, is still conditional, so far as individuals are con-corned. His vengeance will fall upon the land; but the result will be twofold. Destruction will come upon the unrighteous and the sinners (ver. 28) - they will be \"consumed\" (ver. 28), and \"confounded\" (ver. 29); but there will be some on whom the punishment will have a purifying power, whose dross it will purge away, and whom it will convert to God (vers. 25, 27). From these will rise up a new Jerusalem - a \"city of righteousness,\" a \"faithful stronghold\" (ver. 26). Verse 24. - The Lord, the Lord of hosts. In the original, Ha-Adon, Jehovah Sabaoth - i.e. \"The Lord\" (or \"Master\" of men and angels), \"the Self-Existing One of the hosts of heaven\" - i.e., their God, the only proper object of their worship. It gives peculiar weight and significance to this prophecy, that it is introduced by a triple designation of the Divine Being. The Mighty One of Israel. A very unusual designation, only found here and, with the modification of \"Jacob\" for \"Israel, \"in the following places: Isaiah 49:26; Isaiah 60:16; Genesis 49:24; Psalm 132:2, 5. God's might would be shown alike in his vengeance on his enemies, and in his purification of a remnant to serve him. I will ease me of mine adversaries; literally, I will comfort me; i.e. I will rid myself of them, and so obtain the only comfort that they will allow me to receive from them (comp. Ezekiel 5:13, \"I will cause my fury to rest upon them, and I will be comforted\").NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah1:25VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd I will turn my hand upon thee, and purely purge away thy dross, and take away all thy tin:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 25. - I will turn my hand upon thee; rather, I will bring back my hand upon thee; i.e. I will once more put forth the \"strong hand and mighty arm, with which I brought thee out of Egypt\" (Psalm 136:12), and will work another deliverance - the deliverance of Israel out of captivity. Purely purge away thy dross; literally, will purge away thy dross like borax, which was used as a flux in purifying the metal. The prophet continues the metaphor of ver. 22. And take away all thy tin; rather, thy had - the alloy with which the \"silver\" had become mixed.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah1:26VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd I will restore thy judges as at the first, and thy counsellers as at the beginning: afterward thou shalt be called, The city of righteousness, the faithful city.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 26. - I will restore thy judges as at the first (see Exodus 19:25, 26). In the early times there was no bribery, no perversion of justice (Jeremiah 2:2, 3). God will bring back a time when the nation will renew its first love, and be as it was in the days of Moses and Joshua. Thy counselors (comp. 2 Samuel 15:12; 1 Chronicles 26:14; 1 Chronicles 27:32, 33, etc.). The city of righteousness; or, of justice. The prophecy may have been fulfilled in part by the earthly Jerusalem under Zerubhabel, Ezra, and the Maccabees. but is mainly fulfilled in the heavenly Jerusalem - the Church of God, the true Israel. The faithful city (comp. ver. 21). Certainly the post-Captivity Church was \"faithful\" to Jehovah, in the way of acknowledging him, and him only, to be God, to a very remarkable degree, and in strong contrast to its inclination during pro-Captivity times.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah1:27VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTZion shall be redeemed with judgment, and her converts with righteousness.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 27. - Redeemed with judgment; rather, delivered through judgment; i.e. God's judgment shall have the effect of \"delivering\" a remnant, who shall build up Zion once more, and dwell in it. Her converts; i.e. those of her children who turn to God, shall be delivered through God's righteousness, i.e. through the righteous vengeance which he executes upon the unfaithful nation. Some, however, understand both clauses to mean that the penitent remnant shall \"deliver their own souls by their righteousness\" (comp. Ezekiel 14:14, 20; Ezekiel 18:27, etc.).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah1:28VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the destruction of the transgressors and of the sinners shall be together, and they that forsake the LORD shall be consumed.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 28. - Transgressors... sinners... they that forsake the Lord (comp. vers. 2 and 4).

In the day of suffering, sinners are ashamed of having been led away by such poor temptations as those to which they have yielded (comp. Romans 6:21, \"What fruit had ye then in those things whereof ye are now ashamed?\"). The gardens. Kay suggests \"idolatrous pleasure-gardens as those at Daphne, near Antioch, \"which is a reasonable exegesis.

The Assyrian inscriptions enable us to date this prophecy with a near approach to exactness. Ashdod was besieged by an Assyrian army twice in the reign of Sargon - in his ninth year ( B.C. 713) and in his eleventh year ( B.C. 711). On the former occasion it is probable that the arms of a general (Tartan) were employed; on the latter it is nearly certain that Sargon made the expedition in person. The capture of Ashdod, here mentioned, is consequently the first capture. Egypt and Ethiopia were at the time united under one head, Shabak, or Shabatok; and the inhabitants of Ashdod looked to this quarter for deliverance from the Assyrian power. Shortly after the first capture, they revolted, deposed the king whom Sargon had set over them, appointed another, and then proceeded, in conjunction with Philistia, Judah, Edom, and Moab, to call in the aid of the Egyptians and Ethiopians. Isaiah's mission on this occasion was to discourage Judaea from joining Ashdod and her allies in this appeal. He was instructed to prophesy that Assyria would shortly inflict a severe defeat on the two African powers, and carry into captivity large numbers of both nations. The prophecy seems to have had its accomplishment about twelve years later, when Sennacherib defeated the combined forces of Egypt and Ethiopia at Eltekeh, near Ekron (G. Smith, 'Eponym Canon,' p. 133). Verse 1. - In the year that Tartan came unto Ashdod; rather, a tartan. The word was not a proper name, but a title of office, equivalent to surena among the Parthians, and signifying \"commander-in-chief.\" The tartan held the second position in the empire. Isaiah has been accused of having confounded together the two sieges of Ashdod (Cheyne); but if one was conducted by the tartan, and the other by Sargon in person, his words would distinguish as perfectly as possible which siege he meant. When Sargon the King of Assyria sent him. The present passage furnished almost the sole trace of the existence of this monarch - one of the greatest of Assyria's sovereigns - until about the middle of the present century, when the exploration of the Assyrian ruins, and the decipherment of the Assyrian inscriptions, presented him to us in the most distinct and vivid way, as king, conqueror, and builder. He was the founder of the last and greatest of the Assyrian dynasties, the successor of the biblical Shalmaneser, and the father of Sennacherib. He reigned from B.C. 722 to B.C. 705. He was the captor of Samaria; he defeated the forces of Egypt; he warred on Susiana, Media, Armenia, Asia Minor, Cyprus; and he conquered and held in subjection Babylon. He built the great city explored by M. Botta, near Khorsabad, which is sometimes called \"the French Nineveh.\" It is now found that Ptolemy's 'Canon' contains his name under the form of Arkeanus, and that Yacut's 'Geography' mentions his great city under the form of Sarghun. But these facts were unsuspected until the recent explorations in Mesopotamia, and Isaiah's mention of him alone gave him a place in history. And fought against Ashdod, and took it. Ashdod was the strongest of the Philistine cities, and one of the most ancient (Joshua 15:47). Its name is probably derived from a root meaning \"strength.\" We hear of its having stood on one occasion a siege of twenty-nine years (Herod., 2:157). It is now known as Esdud. When Ashdod is first mentioned in the Assyrian inscriptions it is tributary to Sargon, having probably submitted to him in s c. 720, alter the battle of Raphia. It soon, however, revolts and reclaims its independence. In B.C. 713 the Assyrians proceed against it; and its capture is implied by the facts that the Assyrians depose its king, and install, one of his brothers as monarch in his room (comp. 2 Kings 23:34).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah20:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAt the same time spake the LORD by Isaiah the son of Amoz, saying, Go and loose the sackcloth from off thy loins, and put off thy shoe from thy foot. And he did so, walking naked and barefoot.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 2. - Loose the sackcloth from off thy loins. Dr. Kay supposes that Isaiah was wearing sackcloth exceptionally, as during a time of mourning. But it is more probable that the Hebrew sak represents the haircloth (\"rough garment,\" Zechariah 13:4), which, as ascetics, the Hebrew prophets wore habitually (2 Kings 1:8; Matthew 3:4). Walking naked. Probably not actually \"naked,\" for captives were not stripped bare by the Assyrians, but with nothing on besides his short tunic, as the male captives are commonly represented in the Assyrian sculptures.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah20:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the LORD said, Like as my servant Isaiah hath walked naked and barefoot three years for a sign and wonder upon Egypt and upon Ethiopia;VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 3. - My servant Isaiah. Isaiah shares this honorable title, \"my servant,\" with a select few among God's saints - with Abraham (Genesis 26:24), Moses (Numbers 12:7), Caleb (Numbers 14:24), Job (Job 1:8; Job 42:7, 8), Eliakim (Isaiah 22:20), and Zerubbabel (Haggai 2:23). It is a great acknowledgment for the Creator to make to the creature, that he really does him service. Three years. Probably from B.C. 713 to B.C. 711, or during the whole of the time that Philistia, Edom, Moab, and Judah were making representations to the Egyptians and Ethiopians, and endeavoring to obtain their aid (see G. Smith, 'Eponym Canon,' p. 130). It has been proposed, by an arbitrary emendation, to cut down the time to \"three days;\" but a three days' sign of the kind could not have been expected to have any important effect. The supposed \"impropriety\" of Isaiah's having \"gone naked and barefoot\" for three years arises from a misconception of the word \"naked.\" which is not to be taken literally (see the comment on ver. 2). The costume adopted would be extraordinary, especially in one of Isaiah's rank and position; but would not be in any degree \"improper.\" It would be simply that of working men during the greater part of the day (see Exodus 22:26, 27).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah20:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTSo shall the king of Assyria lead away the Egyptians prisoners, and the Ethiopians captives, young and old, naked and barefoot, even with their buttocks uncovered, to the shame of Egypt.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 4. - So shall the King of Assyria lead away the Egyptians prisoners, and the Ethiopians captives. In Sennacherib's annals for the year B.C. 701, twelve years after this prophecy was given, we find the following passage: \"The kings of Egypt, and the archers, chariots, and horsemen of the King of Meroe, a force without number, gathered and came to the aid of Ekron. In the neighborhood of Eltekeh their ranks were arrayed before me, and they urged on their soldiers. In the service of Asshur, my lord, I fought with them, and I accomplished their overthrow. The charioteers and sons of the kings of Egypt, and the charioteers of the King of Meres, alive in the midst of the battle, my hand captured\" (G. Smith, 'Eponym Canon,' pp. 133, 134). Young and old. The intermixture of young and old, of full-grown males with women leading children by the hand or carrying them upon the shoulder, in the Assyrian sculptures, strikes us even on the most cursory inspection of them. Naked and barefoot. Assyrian captives are ordinarily represented \"barefoot.\" Most commonly they wear a single tunic, reaching from the neck to the knees, or sometimes to the ankles, and girt about the waist with a girdle. It is probable that Egyptian and Ethiopian prisoners would be even more scantily clad, since the ordinary Egyptian tunic began at the waist and ended considerably above the knee.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah20:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd they shall be afraid and ashamed of Ethiopia their expectation, and of Egypt their glory.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 5. - They shall be afraid and ashamed.

Sargon speaks of all the four powers who at this time \"sought to Egypt,\" as \"dwelling beside the sea\" (G. Smith, 'Eponym Canon,' p. 130). Such is our expectation; rather, so hath it gone with our expectation; i.e., with Egypt and Ethiopia.NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINE","Isa.21":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah21:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe burden of the desert of the sea. As whirlwinds in the south pass through; so it cometh from the desert, from a terrible land.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 1-10. - THE BURDEN OF THE DESERT OF THE SEA. This is a short and somewhat vague, but highly poetic, \"burden of Babylon\" It is probably an earlier prophecy than Isaiah 13. and 14, and perhaps the first revelation made to Isaiah with respect to the fall of the great Chaldean capital. It exhibits no consciousness of the fact that Babylon is Judah's predestined destroyer, and is expressive rather of sympathy (vers. 3, 4) than of triumph. Among recent critics, some suppose it to refer to Sargon's capture of the city in B.C. 710; but the objection to this view, from the entire absence of all reference to Assyria as the conquering power, and the mention of \"Elam\" and \"Media\" in her place, is absolutely fatal to it. There can be no reasonable doubt that the same siege is intended as in Isaiah 13, where also Media is mentioned (ver. 17); and there are no real grounds for questioning that the event of which the prophet is made cognizant is that siege and capture of Babylon by Cyrus the Great which destroyed the Babylonian empire. Verse 1. - The desert of the sea. The Isaianic authorship of this title is doubtful, since \"the desert of the sea\" is an expression elsewhere wholly unknown to biblical writers. Some regard \"the sea\" as the Euphrates, in which case \"the desert of the sea\" may be the waste tract west of the Euphrates, extending thence to the eastern borders of Palestine. As whirlwinds in the south pass through; rather, as whirlwinds in the south country, sweeping along. The \"south country\" is that immediately to the south of Judaea. Its liability to whirlwinds is noticed in Zechariah 9:14 and in Job 37:9 (compare Major Palmer's 'Sinai,' p. 33). It cometh. What cometh? Dr. Kay says, \"God's visitation;\" Rosenmüller, \"a numerous army.\" But is it not rather the \"grievous vision\" of the next verse? From the desert. The great desert bounding Palestine on the east - a truly \"terrible land.\" Across this, as coming from Baby-Ionia to Palestine, seemed to rush the vision which it was given to the prophet to see.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah21:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTA grievous vision is declared unto me; the treacherous dealer dealeth treacherously, and the spoiler spoileth. Go up, O Elam: besiege, O Media; all the sighing thereof have I made to cease.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 2. - A grievous vision; literally, a hard vision; not, however, \"hard of interpretation\" (Kay), but rather \"hard to be borne,\" \"grievous,\" \"calamitous.\" The treacherous dealer dealeth treacherously; rather, perhaps, the robber robs (Knobel); or, the violent man uses violence (Rosenmüller). The idea of faithlessness passes out of the Hebrew boged occasionally, and is unsuitable here, more especially if it is the army of Cyrus that is intended. Go up, O Elam. The discovery that Cyrus, at the time of his conquest of Babylon, Bore the title of \"King of Ansan,\" not \"King of Persia,\" coupled with the probability that \"Ansan\" was a part of Elam, lends a peculiar interest to these words. Isaiah could not describe Cyrus as \"King of Persia,\" and at the same time be intelligible to his contemporaries, since Persia was a country utterly unknown to them. In using the term \"Elam\" instead, he uses that of a country known to the Hebrews (Genesis 14:1), adjoining Persia, and, at the time of his expedition against Babylon, subject to Cyrus. Besiege, O Media. Having given \"Elam\" the first place, the prophet assigns to Media the second. Eleven years before he attacked Babylon, Cyrus had made war upon Astyages (Istuvegu), King of the Medes, had captured him, and become king of the nation, with scarcely any opposition (see the 'Cylinder of Nabonidus'). Hence the Medes would naturally form an important portion of the force which he led against Babylon. All the sighing thereof have I made to cease. The \"sighing\" caused by Babylon to the nations, to the captives, and to the kings whose prison-doors were kept closed (Isaiah 14:17), God has in his counsels determined to bring to an end.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah21:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTTherefore are my loins filled with pain: pangs have taken hold upon me, as the pangs of a woman that travaileth: I was bowed down at the hearing of it; I was dismayed at the seeing of it.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 3. - Therefore are my loins filled with pain, etc. (comp. above, Isaiah 15:5; Isaiah 16:9-11). The prophet is horrorstruck at the vision shown him - at the devastation, the ruin, the carnage (Isaiah 13:18). He does not stop to consider how well deserved the punishment is; he does not, perhaps, as yet know how that, in smiting Babylon, God will be specially avenging the sufferings of his own nation (see the introductory paragraph). I was bowed down at the hearing, etc.; rather, I am so agonized that I cannot hear; I am so terrified that I cannot see.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah21:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTMy heart panted, fearfulness affrighted me: the night of my pleasure hath he turned into fear unto me.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 4. - My heart panted; rather, my heart trembleth, or fluttereth.

He uses historical infinitives, the most lively form of narrative. Translate, They deck the table, set the watch, eat, drink; i.e. having decked the table, they commit the task of watching to a few, and then give themselves up to feasting and reveling, as if there were no danger. It is impossible not to think of Belshazzar's feast, and the descriptions of the Greek historians (Herod., 1:191; Xen., 'Cyrop.,' 7:23), which mark at any rate the strength of the tradition that, when Babylon was taken, its inhabitants were engaged in revelry. Arise, ye princes, and anoint the shield. In the midst of the feast there enters to the revellers one from the outside, with these words, \"Rise, quit the banquet; get your shields; anoint them; arm yourselves.\" That shields were greased with fat or oil before being used in battle appears from Virg., 'AEneid,' 7:625, and other places. It was thought that the enemy's weapons would more readily glance off an oiled surface.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah21:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor thus hath the Lord said unto me, Go, set a watchman, let him declare what he seeth.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 6. - Go, set a watchman. The event is not to be immediate, it is to be watched for; and Isaiah is not to watch himself, but to set the watchman. Moreover, the watchman waits long before he sees anything (ver. 8). These unusual features of the narrative seem to mark a remote, not a near, accomplishment of the prophecy.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah21:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he saw a chariot with a couple of horsemen, a chariot of asses, and a chariot of camels; and he hearkened diligently with much heed:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 7. - And he saw... he hearkened; rather, he shall see... he shall hearken (Kay). He is to wait and watch until he sees a certain sight; then he is to listen attentively, and he will hear the crash of the falling city. A chariot with a couple of horsemen; rather, a troop of horsemen riding two and two. This is exactly how a cavalry force was ordinarily represented by the Assyrians. Chariots are not intended either here or in ver. 9. They were not employed by the Persians until a late period of their history (see 'Ancient Monarchies,' vol. 4. pp. 113, 122). A chariot of asses, and a chariot of camels; rather, men mounted on asses and on camels. It is well known that both animals were employed by the Persians in their expeditions to carry the baggage (Herod., 1:80; 4:129; Xen., 'Cyrop.,' 7:1, etc.). But neither animal was ever attached to a chariot.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah21:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he cried, A lion: My lord, I stand continually upon the watchtower in the daytime, and I am set in my ward whole nights:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 8. - And he cried, A lion; rather, he cried as a lion; i.e. with a loud deep voice (comp. Revelation 10:3). The watchman, after long waiting, becomes impatient, and can contain himself no longer. He makes complaint of his long vain watch. My lord; rather, O Lord. The watchman addresses his complaint to Jehovah.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah21:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd, behold, here cometh a chariot of men, with a couple of horsemen. And he answered and said, Babylon is fallen, is fallen; and all the graven images of her gods he hath broken unto the ground.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 9. - And, behold, here cometh, etc. Our translators make the words those of the watchman. But they are better taken as the prophet's statement of a fact, \"And behold, just then there cometh a troop of men, riding two and two\" - the sign for which he was to watch (ver. 7), or rather the first part of it. We must suppose the rest of the sign to follow, and the watchman then to listen awhile attentively. Suddenly he hears the sound of a sacked town, and he exclaims, Babylon is fallen, is fallen, etc. All the graven images of her gods he hath broken unto the ground. Recent documents, belonging to the time of Cyrus, and treating of his capture of Babylon, show that this expression is not to be understood literally. Cyrus was not an iconoclast; he did not break into pieces, or in any way destroy or insult the Babylonian idols. On the contrary, he maintained them in their several shrines, or restored them where they had been displaced; he professed himself a worshipper of the chief Babylonian gods - Bel, Nebo, and Merodach - he repaired the temple of Merodach; he prayed to Bel and Nebo to lengthen his days; he caused his son, Cambyses, to take part in the great religious ceremony wherewith the Babylonians opened the new year. Thus his conquest of Babylon did not bring upon its gods a physical, but only a moral, destruction. The Persian victory discredited and degraded them. It proclaimed to Western Asia that the idolatrous system so long prevalent in the region between Mount Zagros and the Mediterranean was no longer in the ascendant, but lay at the mercy of another quite different religion, which condescended to accord it toleration. Such was the permanent result. No doubt there was also, in the sack of the city, much damage done to many of the idols by a greedy soldiery, who may have carried off many images of gold or silver, and broken up others that were not portable, and stripped off the plates of precious metal from the idols of \"brass, and iron, and wood, and stone\" (Daniel 5:6).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah21:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTO my threshing, and the corn of my floor: that which I have heard of the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, have I declared unto you.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 10. - O my threshing, and the corn of my floor. These are the words of the prophet to Israel. Her chastisements have long been \"threshing\" Israel, separating the grain from the chaff, and will do so still more as time goes on. The prophet's message is for the comfort of those who shall have gone through the process and become the true \"children of the threshing-floor\" - pure wheat, fit to be gathered into the garner of God (Matthew 3:12).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah21:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe burden of Dumah. He calleth to me out of Seir, Watchman, what of the night? Watchman, what of the night?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 11, 12. - THE BURDEN OF DUMAH. This short \"burden\" is probably to be understood as uttered with reference to Edom, which the prophet prefers to call \"Dumah,\" i.e. \"silence,\" in reference to the desolation which he sees to be coming upon the country. Such a play upon words is very usual in the East. Isaiah has already given an instance of it in the name under which he has designated Heliopolis (Isaiah 19:18). Verse 11. - Dumah. There were at least two towns of this name ('Dict. of the Bible,' vol. 1. pp. 459, 460); but neither of them is in the district of Seir. It is best, therefore, to regard \"Dumah\" here as representing Edom, or Iaumaea (so the LXX., Jarchi, Rosenmüller, Kay, Cheyne, and others). He calleth to me; rather, one calleth to me; i.e. I seem to hear a call from Mount Seir, as of one making inquiry of me. There is no need to suppose that the inquiry was actually made. Mount Self, or the district south-south-east of the Dead Sea, was the heart of the Idumaean country, which thence extended vaguely eastward and westward. What of the night? i.e. what hour, or, rather, perhaps, what watch of the night is it? May we consider that \"the night is far spent, and the day at hand? Edom had offended Sargon by joining with Ashdod (G. Smith, 'Eponym Canon,' p. 130), and was probably at tiffs time oppressed by Sargon in consequence.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah21:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe watchman said, The morning cometh, and also the night: if ye will inquire, inquire ye: return, come.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 12. - The morning cometh, and also the night.

We may (conjecturally) understand the \"morning\" of the earlier part of Sennacherib's reign, when Edom was at peace with Assyria, merely paying a moderate tribute (G. Smith, 'Eponym Canon,' p. 132), and the \"night\" of the later period in the same king's reign, when (about B.C. 694-690) the country suffered from another Assyrian invasion, in which the king's treasures and his gods were carried off to Nineveh (ibid., p. 137). If ye will inquire, inquire ye; return, come. Some take this very literally, as meaning, \"If ye would inquire further into the meaning of this answer, do so; return to me; come again.\" But this implies that the Edomites had sent an actual messenger to make the inquiry of ver. 5, which is improbable. Others understand a reproach to Edom: \"If ye will have recourse to God in the time of trouble, do so; but then do more - return to him altogether; come, and be one with Judah.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah21:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe burden upon Arabia. In the forest in Arabia shall ye lodge, O ye travelling companies of Dedanim.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 13-17. - THE BURDEN OF ARABIA. Edom will have companions in misfortune among the Arab tribes upon her borders, Dedan, Tema, and Kedar. War will enter their territory, derange their commerce (ver. 13), cause flight and privation (vers. 14, 15), and within a year greatly diminish the number of their fighting men (vers. 16, 17). The date of the prophecy is uncertain, but can scarcely be earlier than B.C. 715, when Sargon made an expedition into Arabia (O. Smith, 'Eponym Canon,' p. 66). Verse 13. - The burden upon Arabia; rather, in Arabia. The phrase is varied from its usual form, probably because it is not Arabia generally, but only certain of the more northern tribes, on whom calamity is about to fall. In the forest... shall ye lodge. The word used is commonly translated \"forest;\" but Arabia has no forests, and the meaning here must be \"brushwood.\" Thorny bushes and shrubs are common in all parts of Arabia. The general meaning is that the caravans will have to leave the beaten track, and obtain such shelter and concealment as the scanty brushwood of the desert could afford. Ye traveling companies of Dedanim. The Dedanim, or Dedanites, were among the chief traders of the Arabian peninsula. They had commercial dealings with Tyre, which they supplied with ivory, ebony, and \"precious clothes for chariots\" (Ezekiel 27:15, 20). This trade they carried on by means of large caravans - the \"travelling companies\" of the present passage. They are thought to have had their chief settlements on the shores of the Persian Gulf, where the island of Dadan may be an echo of their name.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah21:14VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe inhabitants of the land of Tema brought water to him that was thirsty, they prevented with their bread him that fled.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 14. - The inhabitants of the land of Tema brought water; rather, bring? water, O inhabitants. Tema is reasonably identified with the modern Taima, a village of the Hauran, on the caravan route between Palmyra and Peira. Its inhabitants are exhorted to bring water to the thirsty Dedanites, as they pass along this route with their \"travelling companies.\" (For other mentions of Tome, which must not be confounded with Teman, see Job 6:19 and Jeremiah 25:23.) They prevented with their bread him that fled. Several commentators take this clause as imperative, like the last, and render, \"With his bread meet the fugitive;\" but the existing Hebrew text seems to require the rendering of the Authorized Version. Dr. Kay understands the prophet to mean that the men of Tema did not need exhortation; already of their own accord had they given of their bread to the fugitive Dedanites.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah21:15VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor they fled from the swords, from the drawn sword, and from the bent bow, and from the grievousness of war.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 15. - For they fled; rather, they have fled. The Dedanites have been attacked with sword and bow, and have fled from their assailants. Probably the enemy was Assyria, but no trace of the war has been found on the Assyrian monuments.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah21:16VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor thus hath the Lord said unto me, Within a year, according to the years of an hireling, and all the glory of Kedar shall fail:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 16. - Within a year, according to the years of an hireling (see the comment on Isaiah 16:14). All the glory of Kedar shall fail. \"Kedar\" is a name of greater note than either Dedan or Tome. It seems to be used here as inclusive of Dedan, perhaps as a designation of the northern Arabians generally. The people of Kedar, like those of Dedan, carried on trade with Tyro (Ezekiel 27:21). They dwelt partly in tents (Psalm 120:5; Jeremiah 49:29), partly in villages (Isaiah 42:11), and were rich in flocks and herds and in camels. Though not mentioned in the inscriptions of Sargon, Sennacherib, or Esarhaddon, the contemporaries of Isaiah, they hold a prominent place in those of Esarhaddon's son and successor, Asshurbanipal, with whom they carried on a war of some considerable duration in conjunction with the Nabathaeans (G.

What aileth thee now, that thou art wholly gone up to the housetops?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 1-14. - A PROPHECY AGAINST JERUSALEM. The prophet, present in Jerusalem, either actually, or at any rate in spirit, sees the inhabitants crowded together upon the housetops, in a state of boisterous merriment (vers. 1, 2). Outside the walls is a foreign army threatening the town (vers. 5-7). Preparations have been made for resistance, which are described (vers. 8-11); but there has been no turning to God. On the contrary, the danger has but made the bulk of the people reckless. Instead of humbling themselves and putting on sackcloth, and weeping, and appealing to God's mercy, they have determined to drown care in drink and sensual enjoyment (vers. 12, 13). Therefore the prophet is bidden to denounce woe upon them, and threaten that Jehovah will not forgive their recklessness until their death (ver. 14). There is nothing to mark very distinctly the nationality of the foreign army; but it is certainly represented as made up of contingents from many nations. Delitzsch holds that the Assyrian armies were never so made up, or, at any rate, that the nations here mentioned never served in its ranks ('Site of Paradise,' p. 237); but this is, perhaps, assuming that our knowledge on the subject is more complete and exact than is really the case. It is almost impossible to imagine any other army than the Assyrian besieging Jerusalem in Isaiah's time. Moreover, the particulars concerning the preparations made against the enemy (vers. 9-11) agree with those mentioned in 2 Chronicles 32:3-5 and 30 as made by Hezekiah against Sennacherib. And the second section of the chapter has certainly reference to this period. It seems, therefore, reasonable to regard the siege intended as that conducted by Sennacherib in his fourth year ( B.C. 701), of which we have a brief account in his annals (G. Smith, 'Eponym Canon,' p. 135, 11. 15-18). Verse 1. - The burden of the valley of vision. \"The valley of vision\" is only mentioned here and in ver. 5. It must have been one of the deep depressions near Jerusalem troll which there is a good view of the town. The LXX. render, \"the burden of the valley of Zion.\" What aileth thee now? Jerusalem is addressed by the prophet, who assumes the role of a spectator, surprised at what he sees, and asks an explanation. That thou art wholly gone up to the housetops. Partly, no doubt, they went to watch the enemy and his movements, as Rosenmüller says; but still more for feasting and revelry (Judges 16:27; Nehemiah 8:16). The flat roofs of Oriental houses are often used as places of recreation and entertainment, especially in the evening (Shaw, 'Travels,' p. 211; Chardin, 'Voyages en Perse,' vol. 4. p. 116; Layard, 'Nineveh,' vol. 1. p. 177, etc.).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah22:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThou that art full of stirs, a tumultuous city, a joyous city: thy slain men are not slain with the sword, nor dead in battle.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 2. - A joyous city (comp. ver. 13). Thy slain men are not slain with the sword. It is a blockade rather than a siege. Men die, not of wounds, but of privations (Lamentations 4:9). Sennacherib himself says, \"Hezekiah, like a caged bird, within Jerusalem, his royal city, I confined; towers round about him I raised; and the exit of the great gate of his city I shut\" (G. Smith, 'Eponym Canon,' p. 135, II. 15-18).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah22:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAll thy rulers are fled together, they are bound by the archers: all that are found in thee are bound together, which have fled from far.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 3. - All thy rulers are fled together; rather, all thy chief men. We must make allowance for Oriental hyperbole. The meaning is that numbers of the principal men, regarding resistance as vain, had endeavored to make their escape from the doomed town, but had been captured and bound by the enemies' archers. All that are found in thee; rather, belonging to thee. The reference is to those who had made their escape and were fleeing far away. The archers seize them, and bind them all together. We often see a number of captives bound together by a single rope in the Egyptian bas-reliefs. Which have fled from far; rather, which were flying far away.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah22:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTTherefore said I, Look away from me; I will weep bitterly, labour not to comfort me, because of the spoiling of the daughter of my people.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 4. - Therefore said I. The prophet turns from the description of the scene before him to an account of his own feelings. Look away from me, he says; \"leave me free to vent my sorrow without restraint; I wish for no consolation - only leave me to myself.\" Because of the spoiling. The word used sometimes means\" destruction;\" but\" spoiling\" is a better rendering here. Sennacherib describes his \"spoiling\" of Jerusalem on this occasion as follows: \"Thirty talents of gold, eight hundred talents of silver, precious carbuncles, great... stones, couches of ivory, lofty thrones of ivory, skins of buffaloes, horns of buffaloes, weapons, everything, a great treasure, and his daughters, the eunuchs of his palace, male musicians, and female musicians, to Nineveh, the city of my dominion, did Hezekiah send after me\" (G. Smith, 'Eponym Canon,' p. 135, II. 29-37). To what straits Hezekiah was reduced in order to collect a sufficient amount of the precious metals we learn from 2 Kings 18:15, 16.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah22:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor it is a day of trouble, and of treading down, and of perplexity by the Lord GOD of hosts in the valley of vision, breaking down the walls, and of crying to the mountains.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 5. - It is a day... By the Lord; rather, there is a day to the Lord; or, the Lord has a day. God has in reserve such a day; and it will assuredly arrive in due course. Hence the prophet's grief. In the valley of vision. We may suppose that Hezekiah, before he made the submission recorded in 2 Kings 18:14 and in the 'Cylinder of Sennacherib,' col. 4:11. 28, 29, tried the chances of battle against the Assyrians in this valley, and that Isaiah had a prophetic vision of the fight. Breaking down the walls; rather, undermining. The Assyrian sculptures show numerous examples of this practice. Sometimes swords or spears are used to dislodge the stones of the wall, sometimes crow-bars or axes (see 'Ancient Monarchies,' vol. 2. p. 82). Crying. Some regard this word, and also that translated \"the walls\" in the preceding clause, as proper names, and render the passage, \"Kir undermineth, and Shoa is at the mount\" (Ewald, Cheyne, Luzzatto). But it seems unlikely that \"Kit\" would be mentioned twice.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah22:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Elam bare the quiver with chariots of men and horsemen, and Kir uncovered the shield.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 6. - Elam bare the quiver. Elam, the country extending from the Zagros range to the Lower Tigris, and watered by the Choaspes, Eulaeus, Pasitigris, and other rivers, was an independent kingdom from a very early date (Genesis 14:1, 9), and in Isaiah's time was generally hostile to Assyria. Sargon, however, relates that he conquered a portion of the country, planted colonies in it from the more western parts of his empire, and placed both colonists and natives under the governor of Babylon ('Records of the Past,' vol. 9. p. 16). It is thus quite possible that both Sargon and Sennacherib may have had a contingent of Elamites in their armies. With chariots of men and horsemen; rather, with troops of men (who were) horsemen (comp. Isaiah 21:7). Kir uncovered the shield. \"Kir\" is mentioned in 2 Kings as the place to which Tiglath-Pileser transported the inhabitants of Damascus (2 Kings 16:9), and by Amos (Amos 9:7) as the original country from which the Syrians were derived. It has been recently identified with Kirkhi, near Diarbekr, or with Kirruri, in the Urumiyah country (Cheyne); but neither identification is marc than possible. (On uncovering shields as a preliminary to engaging in battle, see Caesar, 'Do Bell. Gall.,' 2:21.)NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah22:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd it shall come to pass, that thy choicest valleys shall be full of chariots, and the horsemen shall set themselves in array at the gate.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 7. - And it shall come to pass, etc. This verse and the next are closely connected, and introduce the new subject of the preparations which the Jews made for their defense. Translate, And it came to pass, when thy choicest valleys were full of chariots (or, troops), and the horsemen had set themselves in array toward the gate, that then did he draw off the cavorting of Judah, etc.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah22:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he discovered the covering of Judah, and thou didst look in that day to the armour of the house of the forest.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 8. - The covering of Judah was that which hid their weakness either from themselves or from the enemy - probably the former. God drew this aside, and they suddenly saw their danger, and began to think how they could best defend themselves. Arms were the first things needed. The armor of the house of the forest. \"The house of the forest\" was probably that portion of the palace of Solomon which he had called \"the house of the forest of Lebanon\" (1 Kings 7:2-5). This was, it would seem, used as an armor (1 Kings 10:17; 1 Kings 14:27; Isaiah 39:2).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah22:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTYe have seen also the breaches of the city of David, that they are many: and ye gathered together the waters of the lower pool.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 9. - Ye have seen also.... are many; rather, ye saw also were many. The breaches of the city of David. \"The city of David\" may be here a name for Jerusalem generally, as \"the city where David dwelt\" (Isaiah 29:1), or it may designate the eastern hill, where David fixed his residence (2 Samuel 5:7; Nehemiah 3:15, 16, 25; Nehemiah 12:37). In 2 Chronicles 32:5 we read that Hezekiah at this time \"built up all the wall that was broken, and raised it up to the towers, and another wall without, and repaired Mille in the city of David,\" where a particular part of Jerusalem seems certainly to be meant. Ye gathered together the waters of the lower pool. The arrangements made by Hezekiah with respect to the water-supply at the time of Sennacherib's invasion, seem to have been the following: He found on the north of the city, where the Assyrian attack was certain to be delivered, in the vicinity of the Damascus gate, a pool or reservoir (Isaiah 7:3), fed by a conduit from some natural source, which lay open and patent to view. The superfluous water ran off from it by a \"brook\" (2 Chronicles 32:4), which passed down the Tyropoeon valley, and joined the Kedron to the southeast of Ophel. His first step was to cover over and conceal the open reservoir, and also the\" brook\" which ran from it, at least as far as the northern city wall, to prevent their use by the Assyrians. He then further made a conduit underground (2 Chronicles 32:30) within the city, along the Tyropoeon depression, to a second reservoir, or \"pool,\" also within the city, which could be freely used by the inhabitants (see ver. 11; and comp. Ecclus. 48:17). Further, it is probable that he carried a conduit from this second pool, under the temple area, to the\" fount of the Virgin\" on the eastern side of Ophel, and thence further conveyed the water by a tunnel through Ophel to the \"pool of Siloam.\" (This last may be the work here alluded to.) The inscription recently discovered at this peel is probably of Hezekiah's time (see 'Quarterly Statement' of Palest. Expl. Fund for April, 1881, p. 70).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah22:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd ye have numbered the houses of Jerusalem, and the houses have ye broken down to fortify the wall.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 10. - Ye have numbered... have broken down; rather, ye numbered... ye broke down. The \"numbering\" was probably in order to see how many could be spared for pulling down. The repair of the walls with materials thus furnished was a sign of extreme haste and urgency. It would seem from vers. 7, 8 that the repairs were not begun until the town was invested.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah22:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTYe made also a ditch between the two walls for the water of the old pool: but ye have not looked unto the maker thereof, neither had respect unto him that fashioned it long ago.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 11. - Ye made also a ditch; rather, a lake, or reservoir (see the comment on ver. 9). But ye have not looked unto the maker thereof; i.e. you have not looked to God, who in his eternal counsels foreknew and decreed all the steps that you are taking for your defense (see below, Isaiah 37:26).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah22:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd in that day did the Lord GOD of hosts call to weeping, and to mourning, and to baldness, and to girding with sackcloth:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 12. - In that day. The day alluded to in ver. 7, when the choice valleys in the neighborhood of Jerusalem were first seen to be full of a hostile soldiery, and the Assyrian horsemen were observed drawing themselves up opposite the gates. Such a sight constituted an earnest call upon the people for immediate repentance. Baldness (comp. Isaiah 15:2; Micah 1:16; Amos 8:10). It has been said that \"baldness\" was forbidden by the Law (Cheyne); but this is not so, absolutely. Baldness was wholly forbidden to the priests (Leviticus 21:5; comp. Ezekiel 44:20); and certain peculiar modes of shaving the hair, the beard, and the eyebrows, practiced by idolatrous nations, were prohibited to all the people (Leviticus 19:27; Deuteronomy 14:2). But such shaving of the head as was practiced by Job (Job 1:20) and other pious men, was not forbidden to laymen, any more than the wearing of sackcloth. It was regarded as a natural mode of exhibiting grief.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah22:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd behold joy and gladness, slaying oxen, and killing sheep, eating flesh, and drinking wine: let us eat and drink; for to morrow we shall die.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 13. - And behold joy and gladness (comp. ver. 2). \"Let us eat and drink, for to-morrow we die,\" is a common sentiment, if not a common expression. It has been supposed to have given rise to the Egyptian practice of carrying round the model of a mummy to the guests at feasts. According to the Greeks, Sardanapalus had a phrase very like it engraved upon his tomb ('Ancient Monarchies,' vol. 2. p. 500). Sailors have often acted upon it, when they found it impossible to save their ship. On seeing their city invested, a portion of the inhabitants of Jerusalem, despairing of safety, did as sailors have done so frequently.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah22:14VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd it was revealed in mine ears by the LORD of hosts, Surely this iniquity shall not be purged from you till ye die, saith the Lord GOD of hosts.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 14. - It was revealed in mine cars by the Lord of hosts; rather, the Lord of hosts revealed himself in mine ears, saying. This iniquity shall not be purged from you till ye die. The sin of turning a call to repentance into an excuse for rioting and drunkenness is one which God will not pardon. It implies a hardness of heart which cannot fail to issue in final impenitence.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah22:15VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThus saith the Lord GOD of hosts, Go, get thee unto this treasurer, even unto Shebna, which is over the house, and say,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 15-24. - PROPHECY ON THE DEPOSITION OF SHEBNA AND THE ELEVATION OF ELIAKIM. In its first and simplest application, this section predicts the fall of one state official and the advancement of an-other - matters, no doubt, of some importance in the court history of the time, but scarcely (with reverence be it said) of such moment as to be worthy either of prophetic announcement or of divinely inspired record. It has, therefore, been generally felt that there must be a secondary application of the passage. According to some, the two officials represent respectively the two cove-hunts, the old and the new; according to others, they stand for the two great parties in the Jewish slate of the time - that which put its trust in Jehovah, and that which leant upon heathen alliances. Verse 15. - The Lord God of hosts. This form, Adonay Jehovah Tsabaoth - rarely used by Isaiah, but occurring above in vers. 5, 12, and 13 - seems to show that this section is in its right place, being intended as a sequel to the description of Sennacherib's siege. This treasurer. The word \"this\" is contemptuous. That translated \"treasurer\" is of doubtful import. The key to it is probably to be found in the cognate noun, translated \"storehouse\" in 2 Chronicles 32:28, and \"store\" in 1 Kings 9:19; 2 Chronicles 8:4, 6; 2 Chronicles 16:4; 2 Chronicles 17:12. Translate, this storekeeper. Shebna (see below, Isaiah 36:2, 11, 22; Isaiah 37:2; and comp. 2 Kings 18:18, etc.). The name, which is not found elsewhere, is thought to be Syriac rather than Hebrew, and Shebna himself is conjectured to have been a foreign adventurer, perhaps \"a refugee from Damascus\" (Cheyne). (See the next verse.) Which is over the house. An office like the imperial praefectus palatio\" at Rome, or the Frankish \"mayor of the palace\" (see Genesis 41:40; 1 Kings 4:6; 1 Kings 18:3). At this time it seems to have been the highest office that a subject could hold (2 Chronicles 26:21; 2 Kings 18:18, etc.).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah22:16VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWhat hast thou here? and whom hast thou here, that thou hast hewed thee out a sepulchre here, as he that heweth him out a sepulchre on high, and that graveth an habitation for himself in a rock?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 16. - What hast thou here? i.e. what business, or what right? It seems, certainly, to be implied that Shebna was wholly unconnected with Jerusalem. Whom hast thou here? i.e. what relations? what family? To be justified in hewing out a large tomb, Shebna should have had a numerous family for whom graves would be needed. Otherwise, his excavation of a grand sepulcher was merely selfish and ostentatious. As he that heweth him out a sepulcher on high. Jewish tombs of any pretension were generally excavations in the solid rock, on the side of some hill or mountain, and had often a very elevated position. Tombs exist on the slopes of all the hills about Jerusalem, but are most numerous on the eastern side of the temple mount, which slopes steeply to the Kedron valley. A square-topped doorway leads into a chamber, generally square, from which recesses, six or seven feet long, two broad, and three high, are carried into the rock horizontally, either on a level with the floor, or with a platform, or shelf, halfway up one of the walls. These recesses have been called loculi. After a body had been placed in one, it was commonly closed by a stone, which fitted into the end, and thus shut off the body from the chamber. Chambers had sometimes twelve such loculi. An habitation (comp. Ecclesiastes 12:5). We must not suppose, however, that the Jews, like the Egyptians and Etruscans, regarded the soul as inhabiting the tomb. The soul descended into sheol; the grave was the \"habitation\" of the body only.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah22:17VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBehold, the LORD will carry thee away with a mighty captivity, and will surely cover thee.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 17. - The Lord win carry thee away with a mighty captivity; rather, the Lord will hurl thee away, O man, with a hurling; i.e. \"will hurl thee away to a distance.\" It is not said that Shebna would be a captive. Will surely cover thee; literally, will cover thee with a covering; i.e. \"will make thee obscure\" (Rosenmüller) - a fitting punishment for one who aimed at attracting attention and making himself famous (ver. 16).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah22:18VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHe will surely violently turn and toss thee like a ball into a large country: there shalt thou die, and there the chariots of thy glory shall be the shame of thy lord's house.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 18. - He will surely violently turn and toss thee, etc.; literally, rolling he will roll thee with rolling like a ball, etc. Into a large country. Assyria, or perhaps Egypt. If Shebna was disgraced on account of his recommending the Egyptian alliance, he may not improbably have taken refuge with Tirhakah. There the chariots of thy glory shall be the shame of thy lord's house; rather, there shall be the chariots of thy glory, O thou shame of thy lord's house. His chariots, in which he gloried, should accompany him, either as spoil taken by the enemy, or as the instruments of his flight.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah22:19VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd I will drive thee from thy station, and from thy state shall he pull thee down.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 19. - I will drive thee from thy station; rather, from thy post, or office (comp. 1 Chronicles 23:28). Shall he pull thee down. Jehovah scorns to be meant in both clauses (comp. Isaiah 34:16). The full accomplishment of this prophecy is nowhere declared to us. We merely find that, by the time of Rabshakeh's arrival at Jerusalem as Sennacherib's envoy (Isaiah 36:2-4), Shebna had lost his post as prefect of the palace, and filled the lower position of scribe or secretary. He may, however, have been subsequently further degraded, and thereupon he may have fled to Egypt, as Jeroboam did (1 Kings 11:40).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah22:20VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd it shall come to pass in that day, that I will call my servant Eliakim the son of Hilkiah:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 20. - In that day. In the day of Shebna's deposition from his office of prefect of the palace. My servant Eliakim. On the dignity of this title, when given by God himself, see the comment on Isaiah 20:3.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah22:21VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd I will clothe him with thy robe, and strengthen him with thy girdle, and I will commit thy government into his hand: and he shall be a father to the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and to the house of Judah.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 21. - With thy robe... with thy girdle. The dress of office worn by Shebna would be taken from him, and Eliakim would be invested therewith. The \"robe\" is the long-sleeved cloak or tunic worn commonly by persons of rank; the \"girdle\" is probably an ornamental one, like those of the priests (Exodus 28:39), worn over the inner tunic. He shall be a father; i.e. a protector, counselor, guide (comp. Job 29:16, \"I was a father to the poor: and the cause which I knew not I searched out\"). It is, perhaps, implied that Shebna had not conducted himself as a \"father.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah22:22VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the key of the house of David will I lay upon his shoulder; so he shall open, and none shall shut; and he shall shut, and none shall open.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 22. - The key of the house of David will I lay upon his shoulder. A key would seem to have been the special badge of the prefect's office, which included the control of the stores (ver. 15), and the general management of the household. It was, perhaps, a part of the form of investiture, that the key should be first laid on the prefect's shoulder and then delivered into his hand. Among the Greeks the priests of Ceres are said to have borne a key on their shoulder, permanently, as a badge of office (Callimach., 'Hymn. ad Cererem,' 1. 45). The reference to this passage in Revelation 3:7 is sufficient to show that Eliakim, the \"servant of Jehovah\" (ver. 20), is, to a certain extent, a type of Christ; perhaps also of his faithful ministers (Matthew 16:19; John 20:23).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah22:23VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd I will fasten him as a nail in a sure place; and he shall be for a glorious throne to his father's house.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 23. - I will fasten him as a nail in a sure place (comp. Ezra 9:8; Zechariah 10:4). The idea intended to be expressed is firmness and fixity of tenure. He shall be for a glorious throne to his father's house (compare the next verse). All his relations, even the most remote, shall derive honor from him, and bask in the sunshine of his prosperity. So shall all members of the family of God, made sons of God by adoption in Christ, participate in the final glory of Christ in his eternal kingdom.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah22:24VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd they shall hang upon him all the glory of his father's house, the offspring and the issue, all vessels of small quantity, from the vessels of cups, even to all the vessels of flagons.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 24. - All the glory. According to scriptural notions, the \"glory\" of a family consists very much in its size (Genesis 15:5; Psalm 127:5, etc.). And Christ's glory in his final kingdom will consist greatly in the number of the saved (Revelation 7:4-9). The offspring and the issue; i.e. the flourishing scions, and the despised seedlings alike. The word translated \"issue\" is a term of contempt (see Ezekiel 4:15). From the vessels of cups; rather, of bowls (comp. Exodus 24:6). To all the vessels of flagons; rather, of pitchers. \"A numerous, undistinguished, family connection\" seems to be intended (Delitzsch).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah22:25VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTIn that day, saith the LORD of hosts, shall the nail that is fastened in the sure place be removed, and be cut down, and fall; and the burden that was upon it shall be cut off: for the LORD hath spoken it.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 25. - SEQUEL OF THE PROPHECY CONCERNING ELIAKIM. This verse has been truly called \"an enigma\" (Kay). It is impossible to understand it of Shebna. \"The nail that was fastened in a sure place\" can only refer to the nail said to have been so fastened in ver. 23. Are we, then, to understand that Eliakim too will experience a reverse of fortune? But then all the force of the contrast between him and Shebna would be gone. Is it not possible that the prophet, seeing in Eliakim a type of the Messiah, and becoming more and more Messianic in his utterances, has ended by forgetting the type altogether, and being absorbed in the thought of the antitype? He, the nail, so surely fixed in his eternal place, would nevertheless be \"removed\" for a time, and then \"he cut down and fall\" (comp. Isaiah 52:14; Isaiah 53:8). At the same time would be \"cut off\" the burden which Messiah bore (Isaiah 53:12, \"He bare the sin of many\"). Verse 25. - In that day. Not the day of Shebna's fall, certainly (ver. 20), but some ether. Is not the day that of Christ's earthly mission, when it seemed as if his people were about to acknowledge him (Matthew 21:1-11; Mark 11:1-10; Luke 19:29-40), and his throne to be established, but suddenly Messiah was \"cut off\" (Daniel 9:26) - stricken for the transgression of his people (Isaiah 53:8)? The burden that was upon it shall be cut off. The great burden upon the Messiah was the load of human sin which he had to bear. \"He himself bare our sins in his own body on the tree\" (1 Peter 2:24). By his death this burden was \"cut off\" (1 John 2:2; 2 Corinthians 5:19; Ephesians 2:16; Colossians 2:14). For the Lord hath spoken it. The double attestation, at the beginning and at the end of the verse, is a mark of the vast importance of the announcement contained in it, which is, in fact, the germ of the great doctrine of the atonement.NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINE","Isa.23":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah23:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe burden of Tyre.

We here reach the last of the \"burdens\" - the concluding chapter of the series of denunciatory prophecies which commenced with Isaiah 13. It is an elegy \"in three stanzas, or strophes\" (Cheyne) - the first extending from ver. 1 to ver. 5; the second, thence to ver. 9; and the third from ver. 10 to ver. 14. An undertone of sadness, and even of commiseration, prevails throughout it, the prophet viewing Tyre as a fellow-sufferer with Israel, persecuted and oppressed by the fame enemy, Assyria, which was everywhere pushing her conquests, and had recently extended her dominion even over Babylon (ver. 13). This last allusion fixes the date of the prophecy to a time subsequent to B.C. 710, when the Assyrian monarch, Sargon, first conquered the country, and took the title of king (G. Smith, 'Epanym Canon,' p. 86). Verse 1. - Howl (comp. Isaiah 13:6, 31). The expression is common in the prophets (see Jeremiah 4:8; Jeremiah 25:34, etc.: Ezekiel 21:12; Ezekiel 30:2; Joel 1:5, 11, 13; Zephaniah 1:11; Zechariah 11:2, etc.). Ye ships of Tarshish. \"Ships of Tarshish\" are first mentioned in connection with the trade carried on by Solomon. Apparently, the term there designates a certain class of ship rather than those engaged in a particular trade (see the comment on 1 Kings 22:48 in the 'Speaker's Commentary,' vol. 2. p. 623). Here, however, Phoenician ships, actually engaged in the trade with Tartessus, may be intended. Tartessus was a very ancient Phoenician settlement in the south of Spain, beyond the Pillars of Hercules, and was the center of a most important and lucrative commerce (see 1 Kings 10:22; Herod., i. 163; Ezekiel 27:12, etc.). In the present passage the returning fleet of merchantmen is addressed, and told that the harbour to which they are hastening is closed, the city desolate. From the land of Chittim. \"Chittim\" here, as in Genesis 10:4, and elsewhere generally, is probably Cyprus, whose most ancient capital was called by the Greeks Kitten (see Joseph, 'Ant. Jud,' 1:6, § 1). The name \"Chittim\" is not improbably a variant of \"Khittim,\" \"the Hittites,\" who may have been the first to colonize the island. A fleet from the Western Mediterranean would naturally touch at Cyprus on its way to Tyro, and would there learn the calamity.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah23:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBe still, ye inhabitants of the isle; thou whom the merchants of Zidon, that pass over the sea, have replenished.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 2. - Be still; rather, be silent, as in the margin. It would be idle to complain or lament. Ye inhabitants of the isle. Tyro was situated on a small isle, which Alexander joined to the mainland by means of a mole (Arrian, 'Exp. Alex.,' 2:23). It is uncertain, however, whether this isle is meant here, or the strip of Phoenician coast, since the Hebrew 'i has both meanings. Thou whom the merchants of Zidon... have replenished. During the flourishing period of Tyro (B.C. 1025-585), Zidon, though it had generally kings of its own, played a secondary part to Tyre, and for the most part acquiesced in Tyrian supremacy. Its best sailors served in the Tyrian fleet (Ezekiel 27:8), and its merchants were content to enrich the recognized \"chief city.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah23:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd by great waters the seed of Sihor, the harvest of the river, is her revenue; and she is a mart of nations.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 3. - By great waters; rather, on great waters; i.e. on the waters of the Mediterranean (cf. Psalm 107:23; Ezekiel 27:26). The Egyptian vessels conveyed the corn intended for exportation to the ports at the mouths of the Nile, where it was transhipped aboard Phoenician craft, which carried it on the open sea to the countries needing it. We never hear of the Egyptians disputing the trade of the Mediterranean with the Phoenicians and the Greeks, though they certainly had trading-vessels at times on the waters of the Red Sea. The seed of Sihor; i.e. the corn of the Nile valley. \"Si-her,\" or rather \"Shihor,\" is the only proper name by which the Nile is designated in the Hebrew Scriptures. It means \"the dark,\" \"the turbid,\" and may be compared with the modern \"Bahr-el-azrak,\" used of the Eastern or Abyssinian Nile, and with the term\" Nilus\" itself, if that signifies \"the dark blue stream.\" It occurs, as the name of the Nile, only in Joshua 13:3; 1 Chronicles 13:5; Jeremiah 2:18; and the present place. Is her revenue; i.e. \"produces a portion of her annual income.\" And she is a man of nations (so Gesenius and Ewald). Delitzsch and Mr. Cheyne translate, \"It is the gain of the nations,\" referring \"it' to the corn which the Tyrians exported.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah23:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBe thou ashamed, O Zidon: for the sea hath spoken, even the strength of the sea, saying, I travail not, nor bring forth children, neither do I nourish up young men, nor bring up virgins.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 4. - Be thou ashamed, O Zidon. Zidon, the most ancient and venerable of the Phoenician cities (Genesis 10:15; Joshua 11:8; Joshua 19:28; Judges 18:7; Justin, 18:3, etc.), is called upon to feel shame because Tyre is captured. The ruin of the metropolitan city would be felt as a disgrace by all the lesser towns, and by Zidon especially. The sea... even the strength of the sea; rather, the stronghold of the sea; i.e. Tyre herself. Tyre declares that she is childless, has neither son nor daughter, is as if she had never travailed nor brought forth children. I travail not, etc.; rather, I have not travailed, nor brought forth, nor nourished up, etc. My children being dead or taken from me, it is as if I had never borne them.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah23:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAs at the report concerning Egypt, so shall they be sorely pained at the report of Tyre.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 5. - As at the report concerning Egypt; rather, when the rumor shall reach Egypt (see the Septuagint, the Vulgate, Gesenius, Knobel, Cheyne, etc.). They shall be sorely pained. The Egyptians bore no great affection towards any foreign nation. They were a people whose charity began and ended at home. But the fall of Tyre was always a shock to them, and was felt to portend evil to themselves. The Asiatic power which was strong enough to capture the island-fortress would be a formidable enemy to Egypt itself, and might be expected at no distant date to attempt the conquest of the Nile valley.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah23:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTPass ye over to Tarshish; howl, ye inhabitants of the isle.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 6. - Pass ye over to Tarshish. The advice was good, and may, perhaps, have been followed to some extent. When Sennacherib attacked Elulaeus of Sidon ( B.C. 701), that monarch fled across the sea ('Records of the Past,' vol. 1. p. 35), probably to Cyprus. When Alexander finally ruined Tyre, a part of the population made its escape on shipboard to Carthage (Arrian,' Exp. Alex.,' 2:24, § 8). An escape of the kind is represented in the Assyrian sculptures (Layard, 'Monuments of Nineveh,' first series, pl. 7l).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah23:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTIs this your joyous city, whose antiquity is of ancient days? her own feet shall carry her afar off to sojourn.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 7. - Is this your joyous city? literally, your joyous one; i.e. Can this wretched heap of ruins be the rich and joyous Tyre? Whose antiquity is of ancient days. Though regarded as less ancient than Zidon (Justin, 18:3), Tyro nevertheless claimed a very remote antiquity. Herodotus was told (about B.C. 450) that its temple of Hercules (Melkarth) had been built two thousand three hundred years previously (Herod., 2:44). Q. Curtius makes the city to have been founded by Agenor, the father of Cadmus, who was supposed to have lived three hundred years before the Trojan War ('Vit. Alex.,' 4:4). It must be noted, however, on the other hand, that there is no mention at all of Tyro in Homer, and none in Scripture until the time of Joshua (Joshua 19:29), about B.C. 1300. Her own feet shall carry her afar off to sojourn (so Lowth, Rosenmüller, Gesenius, Ewald, Kay). Others render the passage, \"whose feet were wont to carry her afar off to sojourn.\" In the one case the coming flight and exile, in the other the past commercial enterprise of the city, is pointed at.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah23:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWho hath taken this counsel against Tyre, the crowning city, whose merchants are princes, whose traffickers are the honourable of the earth?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 8. - Who hath taken this counsel? Who can have conceived the thought of destroying a city at once so powerful and so conducive to the advantage of other states? The answer is given in the next verse. The crowning city; i.e. \"the dispenser of crowns.\" Either to the governors of her colonies, or perhaps to the other cities of Phoenicia Proper. It is not quite clear whether the kings of those cities needed the sanction of Tyro to confirm them on their thrones, or not. The Hebrew word used must certainly be rendered \"crowning,\" and not \"crowned.\" Whose merchants are princes. Not actually sovereigns, but the chief men in the state under the king. Traffickers; literally, Canaanites. But the ethnic name seems to have early acquired the secondary meaning of \"traders\" (see Proverbs 31:24; Job 41:6).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah23:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe LORD of hosts hath purposed it, to stain the pride of all glory, and to bring into contempt all the honourable of the earth.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 9. - The Lord of hosts hath purposed it; rather, hath counseled it. The word is the same as that used in the opening clause of ver. 8. God has conceived the thought of destroying Tyre, for the reasons which the prophet proceeds to specify:NEWLINENEWLINE1. To stain the pride of all glory; or, of all beauty. Not that \"glory\" or \"beauty\" are displeasing to him, or provoke his envy, as the heathen thought (Herod., 7:10, § 4) but that those who \"pride\" themselves on their glory and beauty offend him.NEWLINENEWLINE2. To bring into contempt all the honorable of the earth; i.e. to render contemptible those whom the world honors, though they do not deserve honor.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah23:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTPass through thy land as a river, O daughter of Tarshish: there is no more strength.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 10. - Pass through thy laud as a river; rather, overflow thy land, as the Nile. Shake off all restraint; that is, give thy desires free vent - be no longer cramped and confined by the restrictions of the metro-polls. Tartessus is addressed, as the leading colony, and perhaps the one most oppressed; and in her person all the colonies are called on to shake themselves free of the mother city. There is no more strength; rather, there is no more a girdle; i.e. there is nothing that need restrain yon - the power of Tyre is gone!NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah23:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHe stretched out his hand over the sea, he shook the kingdoms: the LORD hath given a commandment against the merchant city, to destroy the strong holds thereof.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 11. - He stretched out his hand over the sea, By \"he\" we must understand \"Jehovah\" (see ver. 9). God has smitten Tyro - the great maritime power - destroyed its dominion, and set its subject cities free. He shook the kingdoms; i.e. not only Tyre, but the other cities of the Phoenician coast, each of which had its own king (Herod., 7:98; Strab., 16. p. 754). Against the merchant city; rather, against Canaan. Phoenicia is called \"Canaan,\" as England is often called \"Britain.\" So the \"SyroPhoenician woman\" of Mark 7:26 is \"a woman of Canaan\" in Matthew 15:22.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah23:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he said, Thou shalt no more rejoice, O thou oppressed virgin, daughter of Zidon: arise, pass over to Chittim; there also shalt thou have no rest.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 12. - He said. Jehovah continues his threatenings. The oppressed virgin, daughter of Sidon - or rather, the oppressed virgin-daughter of Sidon - may he either. Tyre, which, according to some, was built by fugitives from Zidon, or Phoenicia generally, of which Zidon, as the \"firstborn\" (Genesis 10:15), was a sort of mother. Pass over to Chittim (comp. ver. 6). Chittim (Cyprus) was a nearer refuge than Tarshish, and far more easily reached; but, on the other hand, it was much less safe. Sargon and Esarhaddon both of them exercised dominion over it; and when Abdi-Milkut, King of Sidon, fled there in the reign of the latter, the Assyrian monarch pursued him, caught him, and \"cut off his head\" (G. Smith, 'Eponym Canon,' p. 137). Still, it was so often sought by princes flying from Phoenicia when attacked by Assyria, that cuneiform scholars call it \"the usual refuge of the Phoenician kings\" ('Transactions of Bibl. Archaeology Society,' vol. 4. p. 86). There also shalt thou have no rest. Cyprus submitted to Sargon ('Records of the Past,' vol. 7. p. 26), and again to Esarhaddon (ibid., vol. 8. p. 108). It was included in the dominions of Asshur-bani-pal (G. Smith, 'History of Asshur-bani-pal,' pp. 31, 32). After Nebuchadnezzar's conquest of Tyre, it was annexed by Egypt (Herod., 2:182), on the conquest of which country by Cambyses it became Persian. The Phoenicians had \"no rest\" there after Assyria had once found her way to the island.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah23:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBehold the land of the Chaldeans; this people was not, till the Assyrian founded it for them that dwell in the wilderness: they set up the towers thereof, they raised up the palaces thereof; and he brought it to ruin.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 13. - Behold the land of the Chaldeans (comp. Isaiah 13:19; Isaiah 47:1, 5; Isaiah 48:14, 20). Like Jeremiah and Ezekiel, Isaiah knows the people as Chahleans (Kasdim), the capital as Babylon. Kaldi, in the inscriptions, is a rare word, and the name of a not very important tribe. Yet Berosus uses the term to designate the whole nation. This people was not; rather, is not; i.e. \"is no more a people\" - \"has ceased to exist.\" Sargon conquered Babylon in B.C. 710, and made himself king, ruling it, together with Assyria, until B.C. 705, when it rebelled and recovered its independence. Sennacherib reconquered it in B.C. 704, and again in B.C. 700, when he made his eldest son viceroy. Esarhaddon ruled over both countries, as did Asshur-bani-pal. Though later (about B.C. 620-610) Babylon reasserted her independence, and became a great empire, yet Isaiah was justified, at almost any period of his life after B.C. 710, in speaking of her as non-existent. Till the Assyrian founded it for them that dwell in the wilderness. There is no \"till\" in the original. The clause is separate and independent, not connected grammatically with the preceding. Nor does it assert that the Assyrians \"founded\" Babylon for any one, but only that they \"established\" it, or \"appointed\" it to be a habitation for \"the beasts of the desert\" (comp. Isaiah 13:21; Isaiah 34:14; Jeremiah 1:39, etc.). The prophet views the Assyrians as intending to reduce Babylon to ruins, and leave it waste and uninhabited. The towers thereof; i.e. the siege-towers requisite for reducing so strong a city. They raised up; rather, they made bare (cf. Habakkuk 3:9). He brought it to ruin. \"He\" is \"the Assyrian.\" The case of Babylon is adduced to increase the alarm of Tyro, by reminding the inhabitants of what the Assyrians had done to a town greater and stronger than their own. The allusion is probably to certain severities of Sargon's in B.C. 710, which, however, are rhetorically exaggerated. It was never the policy of the Assyrians to depopulate or destroy Babylon.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah23:14VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHowl, ye ships of Tarshish: for your strength is laid waste.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 14. - Howl, ye ships of Tarshish (comp. ver. 1). The ships that traded with Tarshish, not those belonging to Tarshish, are intended. Your strength is laid waste; rather, your stronghold; i.e. Tyre itself. The elegy ends as it began, with a statement of the bare fact. Alexander's destruction of the city was the final and complete fulfillment of the prophecy. The captures by Esarhaddou (G. Smith, 'Eponym Canon,' pp. 139-142), by Asshur-bani-pal (ibid., pp. 144.145), and by Nebuchadnezzar, were anticipations of the final one, and partial fulfillments of the prophecy.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah23:15VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd it shall come to pass in that day, that Tyre shall be forgotten seventy years, according to the days of one king: after the end of seventy years shall Tyre sing as an harlot.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 15-18. - TYRE'S RESTORATION TO PROSPERITY AND CONVERSION TO JEHOVAH. After an interval, expressed by the symbolic number of\" seventy years,\" Tyre is to rise from her ashes, and become once more a prosperous state, resuming her former occupation of a \"merchant city,\" and once more making great gains, which she will devote to the service of Jehovah. St. Jerome thought that this prophecy had not been accomplished in his day. If so, it cannot be said to have been accomplished yet; unless, indeed, Tyre may be regarded as representing the commercial spirit, which. under Christianity, is not necessarily alien from religion, but shows itself sometimes altogether friendly to the Church, supplying ways and means for ten thousand philanthropic and praiseworthy enterprises (ver. 18). Verse 15. - Tyro shall be forgotten; i.e. \"shall cease to occupy men's thoughts, as a factor in politics - shall pass out of their calculations, and count for nothing.\" Seventy years. \"Forty years\" and \"seventy years\" are the chief representatives in Scripture of an indefinite time. The week of creation seems to have given to seven its quasi-sacred character, which passed from the primary number to the corresponding decimal one. The sacred use of \"seventy\" appears first in the \"seventy elders\" who accompanied Moses to the covenant-feast on Sinai (Exodus 24:9). After this, \"seventy 'talents are mentioned as the weight of the bronze offerings for the tabernacle (Exodus 38:29), and \"seventy\" shekels as the weight of the silver bowls offered by the heads of tribes when the tabernacle was set up (Numbers 7:13-85). The \"indefinite\" us, of \"seventy\" is most apparent in such expressions as that of Genesis 4:24, \"If Cain shall be avenged sevenfold, surely Lamech seventy and sevenfold;\" and that of Matthew 18:22, \"I say not unto thee, Until seven times: but, Until seventy times seven.\" \"Seventy\" seems also to be indefinite in Exodus 15:27; Numbers 33:9; Judges 1:7; Judges 12:13; 2 Samuel 24:15; 1 Kings 5:15: 1 Chronicles 21:14, etc. It is absurd to count the \"seventy years\" of the present passage, as some do, from the accession of Nebuchadnezzar to the death of Nabonidus, for neither did Tyro begin to be forgotten in the first year of the one prince, nor did she immediately recover herself on the death of the other. According to the days of one king; or, like the days of one king. The period, whatever its length, should be to Type \"like the days of one king;\" i.e. unchanging, without hope. Oriental kings prided themselves on maintaining an unaltered policy (cf. 2 Kings 25:27; Isaiah 14:17). Shall Tyre sing as an harlot; literally, it shall be to Tyre as [in] the song of the harlot. A particular song seems to be meant, part of which the prophet proceeds to quote in the next verse.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah23:16VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTTake an harp, go about the city, thou harlot that hast been forgotten; make sweet melody, sing many songs, that thou mayest be remembered.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 16. - Take an harp. Harlots in the East, and indeed in the West also in ancient times (Her., 'Epist.,' 1:14, 1. 25), were expected to be musicians. The harp and the guitar were their usual instruments. Forgotten harlot. In addressing. Tyro as a \"harlot,\" the prophet does not seem to mean more than that her aims were, or at any rate had been, selfish and worldly, such as sever between man and God. She had pursued wealth for the enjoyments that it brought her, not in order to make a good use of it. Hers had been the covetousness which is \"idolatry\" (Colossians 3:5).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah23:17VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd it shall come to pass after the end of seventy years, that the LORD will visit Tyre, and she shall turn to her hire, and shall commit fornication with all the kingdoms of the world upon the face of the earth.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 17. - The Lord will visit Tyre. In mercy, not in judgment (cf. Jeremiah 27:22; Jeremiah 29:10). She shall turn to her hire; i.e. \"to her commerce,\" to her former mode of life. But with the difference noted in ver. 18.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah23:18VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd her merchandise and her hire shall be holiness to the LORD: it shall not be treasured nor laid up; for her merchandise shall be for them that dwell before the LORD, to eat sufficiently, and for durable clothing.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 18. - Her merchandise and her hire shall be holiness to the Lord. There is nothing intrinsically wrong or debasing in commerce. Rightly pursued, and engaged in with the view of devoting the profits made in it to good and pious ends, the commercial life may be as religious, and as acceptable to God as any other. The world has known many merchants who were Christians, in the highest sense of the word. Solomon in his best days was a merchant (1 Kings 9:27, 28; 1 Kings 10:22), but one who employed the wealth which he derived from commerce to the honor and glory of God. It shall not be treasured nor laid up. The merchants shall not lay it up in their own coffers, but expend it wisely and religiously. It shall be for them that dwell before the Lord; i.e. it shall be applied to religious uses - to the sustentation of ministers, the relief of the poor and necessitous among God's people, and other similar purposes. Such an employment of the gains made sanctifies commerce, and makes it a good and a blessed thing.NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINE","Isa.24":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah24:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBehold, the LORD maketh the earth empty, and maketh it waste, and turneth it upside down, and scattereth abroad the inhabitants thereof.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 1-20. - GOD'S JUDGMENTS ON THE WORLD AT LARGE. From special denunciations of woe upon particular nations - Baby-loll, Assyria, Philistia, Moab, Syria of Damascus, Egypt and Ethiopia, Arabia, Judea, Tyre - the prophet passes to denunciations of a broader character, involving the future of the whole world. This section of his work extends from the commencement of Isaiah 24. to the conclusion of Isaiah 27, thus including four chapters. The world at large is the general subject of the entire prophecy; but the \"peculiar people\" still maintains a marked and prominent place, as spiritually the leading country, and as one in whose fortunes the world at large would be always vitally concerned (see especially Isaiah 24:23; Isaiah 25:6-8; Isaiah 26:1-4; Isaiah 27:6, 9, 13). Verse 1. - Behold, the Lord maketh the earth empty. Several critics (Lowth, Ewald, Gesenius, Knobel) prefer to render, \"maketh the land empty;\" but the broader view, which is maintained by Rosenmüller, Kay, Cheyne, and others, seems preferable. The mention of \"the world\" in ver. 4, and of \"the-kings of the earth\" in ver. 21, implies a wider field of survey than the Holy Land. Of course the expression, \"maketh empty,\" is rhetorical, some remarkable, but not complete, depopulation being pointed at (comp. ver. 6). Turneth it upside down (comp. Ezekiel 21:27). Scattereth abroad the inhabitants. The scanty population left is dispersed, and not allowed to collect into masses.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah24:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd it shall be, as with the people, so with the priest; as with the servant, so with his master; as with the maid, so with her mistress; as with the buyer, so with the seller; as with the lender, so with the borrower; as with the taker of usury, so with the giver of usury to him.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 2. - It shall be, as with the people, so with the priest, etc. There shall be \"no respect of persons\" - no favor shown to men of any particular rank or station. All shall suffer equally. The author is obliged to take as examples distinctions of rank known to him; but he carefully selects such as are of almost universal occurrence. There was scarcely any nation of antiquity in which there were not \"priests and people,\" \"masters and slaves,\" \"buyers and sellers,\" \"lenders and borrowers,\" \"takers and givers of usury.\" By \"usury\" is meant, not exorbitant interest, but interest simply, of whatever amount.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah24:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe land shall be utterly emptied, and utterly spoiled: for the LORD hath spoken this word.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 3. - The land; rather, the earth. The same word is used as in ver. I (arets). Utterly spoiled; i.e. \"wasted by rival armies, which have carried fire and sword over the whole of it.\" Compare the declaration of our Lord, \"Ye shall hear of wars and rumors of wars: see that ye be not troubled; for all these things must come to pass, but the end is not yet. For nation shall rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom.., all these are the beginning of sorrows\" (Matthew 24:6-8).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah24:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe earth mourneth and fadeth away, the world languisheth and fadeth away, the haughty people of the earth do languish.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 4. - The earth... fadeth away. As a flower that fades and withers up (comp. Isaiah 1:30; Isaiah 28:1, 4; Isaiah 34:4, etc.; Psalm 1:3; Psalm 37:2). The world. Tabel has never any narrower sense than the entire \"world,\" and must be regarded as fixing the meaning of arets in passages where (as here) the two are used as synonymous. The haughty people; or, the high ones. All the great are brought down, and laid low, that \"the Lord alone may be exalted in that day\" (cf. Isaiah 2:11-17).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah24:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe earth also is defiled under the inhabitants thereof; because they have transgressed the laws, changed the ordinance, broken the everlasting covenant.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 5. - The earth also is defiled. Hitherto the prophet has been concerned with the mere fact of a terrible judgment to be sent by God upon the whole world. Now he sets forth the cause of the fact. It is the old cause, which has reduced so many lauds to desolation, and which in the far-off times produced the Flood, viz. the wickedness of man (Genesis 6:5-13). The earth is \"defiled\" or \"polluted\" by the sins of its inhabitants, and has to be purged from the defilement by suffering. They have transgressed the laws. Apart from both Judaism and Christianity, all mankind have been placed by God under a double law:NEWLINENEWLINE1. The \"law written in their hearts\" (Romans 2:15), which speaks to them through their consciences, and lays them under an obligation that cannot be gainsaid.NEWLINENEWLINE2. The law of positive commands, given to the entire human race through the common progenitors, Adam and Noah, which is obligatory upon all to whom it has been traditionally handed down; but which has been only very partially handed down, and it is not generally felt as obligatory. Mankind has in all ages largely transgressed both laws, and both would seem to be pointed at in the present passage. The transgression of the \"law written in the heart\" is doubtless that which especially calls down God's vengeance, and makes him from time to time execute wrath on the whole world. Changed the ordinance; rather, broken, violated. Transgression in act is intended, not formal abrogation of the Divine ordinances. Broken the everlasting covenant. Mr. Cheyne supposes an allusion to the covenant made with Noah (Genesis 9:16); but it seems better to understand that \"everlasting covenant\" which exists between God and man, in virtue of the nature wherewith God has endowed man, and of the laws which he Ires impressed upon man's con. science. Sophocles well says of these laws, that they areNEWLINENEWLINEὑψίποδες οὐρανίαν δι αἰθέρὰΝΛ´τεκνοθέντες ῶν ὌλυμποςNEWLINEπατὴρ μόνος οὐδέ νιν θνατὰNEWLINEφύσις αηνέρων ἔτικτεν οὐδὲNEWLINEμήν ποτε λάθα κατακοιμάσει Or -NEWLINENEWLINE\"Laws that walk on high, begot and bredNEWLINEIn upper air, whose only sire is Heaven;NEWLINENor did the race of mortals give them birth,NEWLINENor will oblivion ever cause them sleep.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah24:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTTherefore hath the curse devoured the earth, and they that dwell therein are desolate: therefore the inhabitants of the earth are burned, and few men left.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 6. - The curse; rather, a curse. God has pronounced a curse upon the earth on account of man's perversity; and hence the calamities which the earth is about to suffer. Are desolate; rather, are held as guilty (see Zechariah 11:5; and compare the marginal rendering of Psalm 5:10; Psalm 34:21). Are burned; or, scorched - shriveled up by the \"burning anger\" (Isaiah 30:27)and \"fiery indignation\" (Hebrews 10:27) of Jehovah.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah24:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe new wine mourneth, the vine languisheth, all the merryhearted do sigh.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 7. - The new wine mourneth.

Men will still drink; they will seek to drown their care in wine; but they will not have the heart to attempt a song as they drink. Even in their cups they will be silent. Strong drink shall be bitter. By \"strong drink\" (shekar) seems to be meant any intoxicating liquor whatever, including wine. Many such liquors were drunk in Palestine (see 'Dict. of the Bible,' vol. 1. pp. 458, 459). All were more or less pleasant to the taste; but they would taste bitter to those who were warped and soured by the calamities of the time, which would prevent all enjoyment.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah24:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe city of confusion is broken down: every house is shut up, that no man may come in.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 10. - The city of confusion is broken down. No special city seems to be intended. \"Est urbis nomen collective capiendum\" (Rosenmüller). Chaos (tohu) reigns in the cities, where there is no civic life, no government, no order, nothing but confusion. Every house is shut up; bolted and barred against intruders. There is no confidence, no friendly intercourse, no visiting.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah24:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThere is a crying for wine in the streets; all joy is darkened, the mirth of the land is gone.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 11. - There is a crying for wine in the streets. Wine, though still manufactured (see vers. 7, 9) is scarce, but is much sought after. Men clamor for it at the doors of the wine-shops, but are unable to obtain it. They crave for its exhilarating effects, or perhaps for the oblivion which it brings when drunk to excess. If they could obtain it, they would act as the Jews in the siege of Jerusalem (Isaiah 22:13). But they cannot. Hence even the factitious merriment, which wine is capable of producing, is denied now to the inhabitants of the earth, with whom all joy is darkened, from whom all mirth is gone.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah24:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTIn the city is left desolation, and the gate is smitten with destruction.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 12. - The gate is smitten with destruction. The very gates of the towns, generally guarded with such care, are broken down and lie in ruins.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah24:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWhen thus it shall be in the midst of the land among the people, there shall be as the shaking of an olive tree, and as the gleaning grapes when the vintage is done.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 13. - When thus it shall be; rather, for so shall it be. In the time described the condition of the earth shall be like to that of an olive-ground when the beating is done, or of a vineyard when (he grapes are gathered. That is, a small and scattered remnant of inhabitants shall alone be left, like the few grapes and olives that were the portion of the gleaners (cf. Isaiah 17:6). There shall be. These words are not needed, and should be erased. The nexus is, \"so it shall be as the shaking [rather, 'beating'] of an olive tree.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah24:14VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThey shall lift up their voice, they shall sing for the majesty of the LORD, they shall cry aloud from the sea.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 14. - They shall lift up their voice. Even in this time of depression and ruin there shall he a \"remnant,\" which will be faithful to God, and which, from the midst of the sufferings and calamities of the period, will \"lift up its voice,\" in songs of adoration and praise, to Jehovah, and sing, or \"send forth a cry.\" This chorus of praise will go forth - to a large extent - from the sea; i.e. from the Mediterranean.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah24:15VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWherefore glorify ye the LORD in the fires, even the name of the LORD God of Israel in the isles of the sea.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 15. - Wherefore glorify ye the Lord in the fires. The reading baiyyim, \"in the fires,\" is doubtful. If it be regarded as sound, we must understand the \"fiery trials\" which were coming on the faithful remnant. But the LXX. seems to have had the reading baiyyim, \"in the islands\" or \"in the coasts;\" and so Lowth, Hitzig, and Mr. Oheyne.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah24:16VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFrom the uttermost part of the earth have we heard songs, even glory to the righteous. But I said, My leanness, my leanness, woe unto me! the treacherous dealers have dealt treacherously; yea, the treacherous dealers have dealt very treacherously.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 16. - Glory to the righteous. The righteous remnant perceive that the calamities which have come upon the earth are ushering in a time of honor and glory for themselves; and they console themselves by making this fact the burden of some of their songs. Their honor, it must be remembered, is bound up with God's glory; which will not shine forth fully till their salvation is complete, and they \"reign with him\" in glory (2 Timothy 2:12). But I said, My leanness. The thought of this joyful time, when the saints shall reign with their Lord in a new heaven and a new earth, recalls the prophet (contrast being one of the laws of the association of ideas) to the misery of the present, and his own participation therein. A time of suffering, of wasting, and pining away must be endured - for how long he knows not - before the joyous consummation, towards which he stretches in hope and confident expectancy, can be reached. This is the period of his \"leanness.\" The treacherous dealers, or ungodly of the earth, will bear sway during this period, and will deal treacherously and cruelly with God's saints, persecuting them incessantly in a thousand ways. Have dealt. The perfect of prophetic certainty.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah24:17VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFear, and the pit, and the snare, are upon thee, O inhabitant of the earth.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 17. - Fear, and the pit, and the snare, are upon thee. Man will be like a hunted animal, flying from pursuit, and in danger at each step of falling into a pit or being caught in a snare (comp. Jeremiah 48:43, 44, where the idea is borrowed from this place, and applied to a particular nation).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah24:18VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd it shall come to pass, that he who fleeth from the noise of the fear shall fall into the pit; and he that cometh up out of the midst of the pit shall be taken in the snare: for the windows from on high are open, and the foundations of the earth do shake.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 18. - The noise of the fear; i.e. the sound of the pursuers. Hunters pursued their game with shouts and cries. The windows from on high are open (comp. Genesis 7:11). It is not actually another flood that is threatened, but it is a judgment as sweeping and destructive as the Flood.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah24:19VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe earth is utterly broken down, the earth is clean dissolved, the earth is moved exceedingly.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 19. - The earth is utterly broken down. The material globe itself breaks up and perishes. It is \"the crack of doom.\" Mr. Cheyne remarks that \"the language imitates the cracking and bursting with which the present world shall pass away.\" The Authorized Version is very feeble compared to the original.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah24:20VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe earth shall reel to and fro like a drunkard, and shall be removed like a cottage; and the transgression thereof shall be heavy upon it; and it shall fall, and not rise again.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 20. - The earth... shall be removed like a cottage; rather, sways to and fro like a hammock, Rosenmüller observes, \"Alludit ad pensiles lectos, quos, metu ferrarum, in arboribus sibi parare solent, istis in terris, non custodes solum hortorum camporumve, sed et iter facientes.\" The transgression thereof shall be heavy upon it; i.e. the earth perishes on account of men's sins. It shall fall, and not rise again. The present earth is to disappear altogether, and to be superseded by \"a new heaven and a new earth\" (Revelation 21:1).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah24:21VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd it shall come to pass in that day, that the LORD shall punish the host of the high ones that are on high, and the kings of the earth upon the earth.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 21-23. - THE SUPRAMUNDANE JUDGMENT, AND FINAL ESTABLISHMENT OF GOD'S KINGDOM. Upon the destruction of the world there is to supervene a visitation of those who have been specially instrumental in producing the great wickedness that has brought the world to an end. These most guilty ones are classified under two heads: they consist ofNEWLINENEWLINE(1) the host of the high ones that are on high (literally, \"the host of the height in the height\"); andNEWLINENEWLINE(2) the kings of the earth upon the earth. These are to be \"gathered together in the pit,\" and \"shut up in the prison,\" and finally, after a long imprisonment, punished (vers. 21, 22). Then the visible reign of the Lord of hosts is to be established \"in Mount Zion and in Jerusalem,\" and he is to rule in the presence of his \"ancients\" in glory (ver. 23). Verse 21. - In that day. About that time - in connection with the series of events just related. The Lord shall punish the host of the high ones. It is generally allowed that these high ones, set m contrast as they are with the \"kings of the earth,\" must belong to the class of supramundane intelligences, spiritual beings of a high order. Some have inclined to identify them with the \"patron-spirits of nations,\" spoken of by Daniel (Daniel 10:13, 20, 21); but those \"patron-spirits\" are among the elect and unfallen angels; they protect nations, but do not lead them into sin or wickedness; they have no need to be \"visited,\" and will certainly not be \"shut up in prison\" with the wicked kings of the earth. The spirits here spoken of must belong to the class of fallen spirits - they must be included among those \"principalities and powers,\" of whom St. Paul speaks (Ephesians 6:12), whom he calls \"the rulers of the darkness of this world,\" and to whom he ascribes \"spiritual wickedness in high places.\" The punishment of such spirits is, perhaps, shadowed forth in the eighty-second psalm; it was distinctly taught in the Book of Enoch; and it is glanced at by St. Jude in his Epistle (ver. 6). And the kings. Kings, especially kings in the Oriental sense, have an enormous influence over the nations which they govern, and therefore a heavy responsibility. The kings of the nations are viewed here as having brought about the general corruption and wickedness which has necessitated the destruction of the earth.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah24:22VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd they shall be gathered together, as prisoners are gathered in the pit, and shall be shut up in the prison, and after many days shall they be visited.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 22. - In the pit; literally, in a dungeon. Mr. Cheyne suggests that sheol, or \"hell,\" is meant; but the context points to some narrower confinement. In the prison; rather, in prison (comp. 2 Peter 2:4; Jude 1:6). After many days. In the Revelation (Revelation 20:2) Satan is bound \"a thousand years;\" i.e. an indefinite term. The imprisonment of the present passage is scarcely the same, but it is analogous. God's purposes require sometimes long periods of inaction. Shall they be visited; or, published. The word is the same as that translated \"punish\" in ver. 21. \"Visiting\" for good is scarcely to be thought of.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah24:23VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen the moon shall be confounded, and the sun ashamed, when the LORD of hosts shall reign in mount Zion, and in Jerusalem, and before his ancients gloriously.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 23. - The moon shall be confounded, and the sun ashamed. Some interpret this in the light of Joel 2:31; Joel 3:15; Matthew 24:29; Revelation 6:12, as pointing to that physical change, real or phenomenal, in the shining of the sun and moon, which is to be one of the antecedent signs of Christ's coming at the last day. But the expressions used suggest rather a contrast between the dazzling splendor of Christ's actual appearance and the normal brightness of sunlight and moonlight. The greater and lesser lights will \"pale their ineffectual fires\" before the incomparable brightness of the \"Sun of Righteousness\" (Malachi 4:2). When the Lord of hosts shall reign in Mount Zion, and in Jerusalem. The spiritual Zion and the heavenly Jerusalem can alone be meant, since the earth is no more (ver. 20). (On these, see Revelation 21, 22.) Before his ancients; or, his elders. Four and twenty elders, clothed in white raiment, with crowns of gold upon their heads, are represented in the Apocalypse as sitting round about the throne of God perpetually (Revelation 4:4), and worshipping God and the Lamb (Revelation 4:10; Revelation 5:8, 14).NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINE","Isa.25":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah25:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTO LORD, thou art my God; I will exalt thee, I will praise thy name; for thou hast done wonderful things; thy counsels of old are faithfulness and truth.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 1-12. - ISAIAH'S SONG OF PRAISE ON THE ESTABLISHMENT OF GOD'S KINGDOM. AS in Isaiah 12, after describing the first setting up of Christ's kingdom and the call of the Gentiles, the prophet broke out into song, through joy at the tidings he was commissioned to announce, so now, having proclaimed the final establishment of the same kingdom in the heavenly Zion, he is again carried away by the sense of exultant gladness into a fresh Lobgesang, which he utters in his own person - not, as the former one, in the person of the Church. His song divides itself into three sections:NEWLINENEWLINE(1) vers. 1-5, a thanksgiving for deliverance;NEWLINENEWLINE(2) vers. 6-8, a commemoration of blessings granted; andNEWLINENEWLINE(3) vers. 9-12, exultation in the security obtained. Verse 1. - Thou art my God; I will exalt thee (comp. Exodus 15:2 and Psalm 118:28). To Isaiah the \"Song of Moses\" seems to have been a pattern thanksgiving, from which he delighted to draw his phrases when he was bent on formally singing praise to God. Compare the following: Exodus 15:2 with Isaiah 12:2, \"He is become my salvation;\" the same with Isaiah 25:1, \"He is my God; I will exalt him;\" Exodus 15:6 with Isaiah 13:16, \"Hath dashed in pieces;\" Exodus 15:7 with Isaiah 47:14, \"Consumed them as stubble;\" Exodus 15:11 with Isaiah 46:5, \"Who is like,\" etc.? the same with Isaiah 25:1, \"Doing wonders;\" Exodus 15:16 with Isaiah 8:13, \"Fear and dread;\" Exodus 15:18 with Isaiah 24:23, \"The Lord shall reign.\" Wonderful things; thy counsels of old are, etc.; rather, thou hast wrought wonders, counsels of old, faithfulness and truth. The wonders for which God is praised were decreed in his counsels from all eternity; their accomplishment shows forth God's \"faithfulness\" and \"truth.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah25:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor thou hast made of a city an heap; of a defenced city a ruin: a palace of strangers to be no city; it shall never be built.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 2. - Thou hast made of a city an heap. No particular city is pointed at. The prophet has in his mind the fate of all those cities which have been enemies of Jehovah and persecutors of the saints upon earth. A defended city; i.e. \"a fenced, or fortified, city.\" A palace of strangers. As the \"city\" of this passage is not an individual city, so the \"palace\" is not an individual palace. All the palaces of those who were \"strangers\" to God and his covenant have ceased to be - they are whelmed in the general destruction (see Isaiah 24:20). They will never rise again out of their ruins.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah25:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTTherefore shall the strong people glorify thee, the city of the terrible nations shall fear thee.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 3. - Therefore shall the strong people glorify thee; rather, strong peoples. God's judgments on the nations specially hostile to him would cause some among the heathen peoples to range themselves on his side. Perhaps Persia is mainly intended (see Isaiah 44:28; Isaiah 45:1, etc.; and comp. Ezra 1:1-4; Ezra 6:3-12, etc.). The city of the terrible nations; rather, cities of terrible nations. Though the noun is singular, the verb is plural, showing that the word \"city\" is again used distributively.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah25:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor thou hast been a strength to the poor, a strength to the needy in his distress, a refuge from the storm, a shadow from the heat, when the blast of the terrible ones is as a storm against the wall.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 4. - The poor... the needy. The \"poor and needy\" are especially the afflicted saints, whom the ungodly of the earth have so long injured and oppressed. God is ever a \"Strength\" and \"Refuge\" to such (comp. Isaiah 14:30; Isaiah 29:19; and see also Psalm 72:12-14). A Refuge from the storm (comp. Isaiah 4:6; and the Psalms passim). A Shadow from the heat. The idea is a little enlarged in Isaiah 32:2. Its germ is, perhaps, to be found in Psalm 121:5, 6. No writer accumulates striking images with such force and beauty as Isaiah. Primarily, the entire imagery has reference to what God will have done for his people when the final consummation arrives. Secondarily, a precious encouragement is held out to all who are undergoing their earthly trial and probation, who are taught where to look for a sure refuge in time of trouble.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah25:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThou shalt bring down the noise of strangers, as the heat in a dry place; even the heat with the shadow of a cloud: the branch of the terrible ones shall be brought low.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 5. - Thou shalt bring down. The past foreshadows the future. What God had done in \"bringing down\" the enemies of his saints, he would do again and again. He could as easily bring to naught the clamorous uprising of heathen nations (strangers) against his people, as temper the sun's heat by the interposition of a thick cloud. The branch; rather, the song (comp. Isaiah 24:16; Job 35:10; Psalm 95:2; Psalm 119:51). The exultant chant of triumph which the ungodly are sure to raise as they deem their victory over the people of God complete, will be stopped in mid-career, and \"brought low,\" or reduced to silence, by the crushing overthrow predicted in Isaiah 24.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah25:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd in this mountain shall the LORD of hosts make unto all people a feast of fat things, a feast of wines on the lees, of fat things full of marrow, of wines on the lees well refined.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 6-8. - The blessings of the final state are now touched upon, as a special subject for thanksgiving. They are not enumerated; but a certain number are set forth, as specimens from which we may form a conception of the general condition of the \"saved.\" These are:NEWLINENEWLINE(1) a heavenly feast, in which they will all participate (ver. 6);NEWLINENEWLINE(2) a removal of the \"veil,\" or \"covering,\" which is in this life over all things, causing men to have an indistinct vision, and an erroneous estimate of their value;NEWLINENEWLINE(3) the abolition of death, which will no longer hang over them as a thing to be feared; andNEWLINENEWLINE(4) the cessation of tears, or the entire freedom of the saved from all sorrow. Verse 6. - In this mountain; i.e. the heavenly Zion - the \"mountain of the Lord's house\" (Isaiah 2:2; comp. Isaiah 24:23). Unto all people; rather, unto all peoples. There is no restriction of salvation to any particular race or nation - \"Jew, Greek, barbarian, Scythian, bond, free\" (Colossians 3:11), are equally invited, and some of each come in (comp. Daniel 7:14; Matthew 8:11; Revelation 5:9; Revelation 7:9). The Church of the redeemed contains men and women of all \"nations and kindreds, and peoples, and tongues.\" A feast of fat things. It follows from many passages of Holy Scripture that there is something in the final beatitude of man which is best represented to us in our present condition by the image of a \"feast\" - something very different, no doubt, from the festive joy of which our Teutonic ancestors hoped to partake in the halls of Odin, but yet figured to us most fitly and appropriately by terms ordinarily used to describe earthly feasting. Our Lord tells of a \"marriage supper,\" to which he will invite his friends (Matthew 22:2-12); and the scene of the \"marriage supper of the Lamb, \"according to St. John in the Revelation\" (Revelation 19:7-9), is heaven. There man, it would seem, will partake of a sacrificial feast with his glorified Lord (Matthew 26:29) - will eat the \"heavenly manna,\" which is \"angels' food\" (Psalm 78:25), and drink a spiritual drink which may be called \"the fruit of the vine,\" deriving from this \"eating\" and \"drinking\" life and joy and strength. It has been already observed, in the Commentary upon Exodus (p. 581), that the sacrificial meal on Sinai, whereto the seventy elders were admitted (Exodus 24:9-11), prefigured this heavenly feasting, and throws a certain light upon it. All gross and carnal ideas must, of course, be subtracted from the conception of the heavenly festivity; but it seems to be true to say that our author, and also St. John and our Lord himself, imply that in the world to come there will be a feast, at which God will be the Host, and all men, priests and laity alike, his guests, and receive from him the choicest and most exquisite gifts - gifts which will make them supremely happy (see Mr. Cheyne's note on the passage, p. 148). A feast of wines on the lees. 'Wine which remained on its Ices, and was not poured off them into another vessel, was considered to be of especial strength (see Jeremiah 48:11). Its defect was a want of clearness. The wine of the heavenly banquet is to be at once strong and perfectly clear or \"well refined.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah25:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he will destroy in this mountain the face of the covering cast over all people, and the vail that is spread over all nations.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 7. - He will destroy... the face of the covering. According to some, the \"covering cast ever all people\" is death, and the second clause of the verse is a mere repetition of the first. But, though the heads of criminals were covered when they were led to execution (Esther 7:8), yet death itself is never elsewhere called a \"covering.\" May not the prophet have in view that \"veil\" or \"covering\" of misconception and prejudice, whereof St. Paul speaks as lying \"on the hearts of the Jewish nation,\" and preventing them from discerning the true sense of Scripture (2 Corinthians 3:15)? Certainly one of the great curses of humanity while here is its inability to see things as they really are - its colored, distorted, prejudiced, views of life and death, of this world and the next, of self-interest, duty, happiness. This \"veil\" is certainly to be done away; for \"now we see through a glass darkly, but then face to face; now we know in part, but then shall we know even as we are known\" (2 Corinthians 13:12).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah25:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHe will swallow up death in victory; and the Lord GOD will wipe away tears from off all faces; and the rebuke of his people shall he take away from off all the earth: for the LORD hath spoken it.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 8. - He will swallow up death in victory; rather, he will abolish death forever. Hosea, a contemporary, was inspired to write! \"Will ransom Israel from the power of the grave; I will redeem them from death: O death, I will be thy plagues; O grave, I will be thy destruction\" (Hosea 13:14); but otherwise this was the first announcement that death was to disappear and to cease to be a possibility. It was an enormous advance on the dim and vague conceptions of a future life hitherto current (Job 19:25, 27; Psalm 17:15) to have such an announcement made as this. Hitherto men had been \"through fear of death all their life subject to bondage\" (Hebrews 2:15). Now they were taught that, in the resurrection-life, there would be no tear, no possibility of death. The joyous outburst of the apostle, when he quotes the present passage (2 Corinthians 15:54), is the natural thanksgiving song of reassured humanity, on recognizing its final deliverance from the unspeakable terror of death and annihilation. The Lord God will wipe away tears from all faces. A recent commentator asks, \"What place is left for tears?\" But surely death is not the only cause of human mourning. Our own sins, the sins and sufferings of our dear ones, are the main provocatives of our tears. When it is promised, as here and in Revelation 7:17 and Revelation 21:4, that \"there shall be no more pain, neither sorrow nor crying,\" the revelation is made that there shall be no more sin; for where sin is, sorrow must be. The rebuke of his people shall he take away. It will be among the lesser satisfactions of the final condition of the saved that they are no longer subject to reproach. In this life they have to endure continually reproach, rebuke, contumely (Psalm 74:10; Psalm 89:50, 51, etc.). In the resurrection-life they will be exempt from any such annoyance. The Lord hath spoken it. God's word has gone forth. There can be no retractation. The blessings promised are certain to be obtained.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah25:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd it shall be said in that day, Lo, this is our God; we have waited for him, and he will save us: this is the LORD; we have waited for him, we will be glad and rejoice in his salvation.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 9-12. - After thanksgiving for deliverance in the past, and commemoration of blessings in the present, confidence is expressed in the future.NEWLINENEWLINE(1) The redeemed declare their joy that they have \"waited for God,\" trusted in him, and looked to him for salvation. They feel that they \"have their reward.\"NEWLINENEWLINE(2) The prophet declares his conviction that the enemies of God's elect are henceforth powerless. They are personified under the name of \"Moab,\" and regarded as still animated by sentiments of hostility; but their absolute impotency for working evil is insisted on (vers, 11, 12). Verse 9. - It shall be said; literally, one shall say; i.e. the redeemed generally shall thus express themselves. We have waited for him. During all the weary time of their oppression and persecution, the godly remnant (Isaiah 24:13-15) was \"waiting fur the Lord,\" i.e. trusting in him, expecting him to arise and scatter his enemies, won-daring that he endured so long the \"contradiction of sinners against himself\" (Hebrews 12:3), but content to abide his determination of the fitting season for coming forward as their Avenger, and now quite satisfied that he has avenged them in his own good time and in his own good way. We will be glad and rejoice (comp. Psalm 118:24 and Song of Solomon 1:4).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah25:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor in this mountain shall the hand of the LORD rest, and Moab shall be trodden down under him, even as straw is trodden down for the dunghill.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 10. - In this mountain shall the hand of the Lord rest. The protecting hand of God will ever be stretched out over the spiritual Zion - the Church of the Redeemed - to defend it and keep it safe throughout eternity. Moab shall be trodden down. Various reasons have been given for the selection of Moab to represent the enemies of the redeemed. Perhaps, as the Moabites were, on the whole, the bitterest of all the adversaries of the Jews (see 2 Kings 24:2; Ezekiel 25:8-11), they are regarded as the fittest representatives of the human adversaries of God. For the dung-hill; rather, in the water of a dung-pit. The image is, perhaps, selected with conscious reference to Psalm 83, where the psalmist prays that the \"children of Lot\" and their helpers may become \"as the dung of the earth\" (ver. 10).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah25:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he shall spread forth his hands in the midst of them, as he that swimmeth spreadeth forth his hands to swim: and he shall bring down their pride together with the spoils of their hands.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 11. - He shall spread forth his hands... as he that swimmeth. Moab will endeavor to save himself from sinking in the water of the dung-pit; but in vain. God will bring down his pride, or abase his haughtiness, together with all the plots and snares that he contrives. A continued plotting of the enemies of God against his Church seems to be assumed, even after the Church is established in the spiritual Zion under the direct protection and rule of Jehovah.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah25:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the fortress of the high fort of thy walls shall he bring down, lay low, and bring to the ground, even to the dust.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 12. - The fortress of the high fort... shall he bring down, etc.; rather, hath he bowed down, laid low, brought down to earth. The past mercies of God in abasing the pride of the Church's foes, rather than any further mercies of the same kind, seem to be here spoken cf. Mr. Cheyne suggests that the verse is out of place.NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINE","Isa.26":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah26:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTIn that day shall this song be sung in the land of Judah; We have a strong city; salvation will God appoint for walls and bulwarks.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 1-18. - A SONG OF THE REDEEMED IN MOUNT ZION. The prophet, having (in Isaiah 25.) poured forth his own thankfulness to God for the promise of the Church's final redemption and triumph, proceeds now to represent the Church itself in the glorified state as singing praise to God for the same. Verse 1. - In that day. In the \"day of God\" (2 Peter 3:12), the period of the \"restitution of all things\" (Acts 3:21). In the land of Judah; i.e. in the \"new earth\" - whose city will be the \"heavenly Jerusalem,\" and wherein will dwell \"the Israel of God\" - the antitype whereof the literal \"land of Judah\" was the type. A strong city; literally, a city of strength. In the Revelation of St. John the new Jerusalem is represented as having \"a wall great and high\" (Revelation 21:12), and \"twelve gates,\" three on each side. The intention is to convey the idea of complete security. In the present passage the city has \"gates\" (ver. 2), but no \"walls\" - walls and bulwarks being unnecessary, since the saving might of God himself would be its sure defense against every enemy.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah26:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTOpen ye the gates, that the righteous nation which keepeth the truth may enter in.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 2. - Open ye the gates. The command is given by God to his angels within the city, or perhaps by some angels to others, to \"open the gates,\" and let the saints march in and take possession (comp. Psalm 118:19, 20, which seems to represent the same occasion; and Psalm 24:7-10, which tells of another occasion on which the angelic warders were bidden to throw open the gates of the celestial city. The righteous nation which keepeth the truth; literally, a righteous nation. A people, made up of all kindreds and nations and tongues, which should henceforth be \"the people of God\" They are \"righteous,\" as washed clean from all taint of sin in the blood of the Lamb. They \"keep the truth,\" or \"keep faithfulness,\" as under all circumstances clinging loyally to God.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah26:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThou wilt keep him in perfect peace, whose mind is stayed on thee: because he trusteth in thee.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 3. - Thou wilt keep him, etc.; literally, the steadfast mind thou wilt keep in peace, in peace; i.e. \"in perfect peace\" (comp. Psalm 112:7, 8). The writer's mind throughout the first paragraph of his\" song\" (vers. 1-4)\"is running\" (as Mr. Cheyne well observes) \"on the security and immovableness of the new Jerusalem.\" All is peace and sure defense on God's side; all is trust and perfect confidence on the side of man. The first words of the verse may be taken in various ways - the above rendering (which seems to us the best) is that of Delitzsch and Kay.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah26:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTTrust ye in the LORD for ever: for in the LORD JEHOVAH is everlasting strength:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 4. - Trust ye in the Lord. The faithful exhort each other to perfect trust, in the new Jerusalem, as in the old (see Psalm 115:9-11). In the Lord Jehovah; literally, in Jab Jehorah (comp. Isaiah 12:2). Is everlasting strength; literally, is the Rock of ages. A certain refuge throughout all eternity is, no doubt, intended (see the comment on Isaiah 17:10).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah26:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor he bringeth down them that dwell on high; the lofty city, he layeth it low; he layeth it low, even to the ground; he bringeth it even to the dust.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 5. - He bringeth down; rather, he hath brought down. The redeemed praise God for his past mercies. He brought down in his own good time all the proud and lofty ones who exalted themselves against him and oppressed his saints, making cities desolate (Isaiah 24:10, 12) and giving over their inhabitants to destruction (Isaiah 24:6). Them that dwell on high; i.e. \"that exalt themselves.\" It is net eminence, but pride, that provokes the Divine anger. The heathen judged differently (see Herod., 7:10, § 4). The lofty city (comp. Isaiah 24:10, 12; Isaiah 25:2, 3). The \"world-city\" (as it has been called); i.e. the idealized stronghold of the adversaries of God in this world, is intended.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah26:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe foot shall tread it down, even the feet of the poor, and the steps of the needy.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 6. - The foot shall tread it down; rather, trode it down. The feet of the poor, and the steps of the needy; i.e. the feet of God's people, the weak and afflicted of this world, trod down ultimately, or brought to destruction and ruin, the great world-power - not so much that they were victorious in an actual physical contest, as that they, finally triumphed through God's judgment on the world-power, which brought it to naught, and left it for his people to show their contempt by trampling upon the smoking ruins.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah26:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe way of the just is uprightness: thou, most upright, dost weigh the path of the just.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 7. - The way of the just is uprightness; or, the path for the just is straight. It is one of the main blessings of the righteous that God \"makes their way straight before their face\" (Psalm 4:8), \"leads them in a plain path\" (Psalm 27:11), \"shows them the way they are to walk in\" (Psalm 143:8), so that they are for the most part free from doubt and perplexity as to the line of conduct which it behooves them to, pursue. If this is so in the present life, still more will it be the uniform condition of the just in another sphere. Then God will of a surety \"direct all their paths\" (Proverbs 3:6). Thou, most upright, dost weigh; literally, O upright One, thou dost weigh. The term \"upright\" is applied to God in Deuteronomy 32:4; Psalm 25:8; and Psalm 92:16. By \"weighing the path of the just\" is meant keeping it, as Justice keeps her scales, straight and level.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah26:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTYea, in the way of thy judgments, O LORD, have we waited for thee; the desire of our soul is to thy name, and to the remembrance of thee.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 8. - Yea, in the way of thy judgments... have we waited for thee; rather, we waited. During the long years of our affliction and persecution in the world, we waited in the constant expectation that \"thy judgments\" would fall upon our persecutors. We were not impatient. We knew that thou wouldst visit us at the tilting time. The desire of our soul is to thy Name; rather, the desire of our soul was to thy Name. During all the weary time of waiting, we longed for thee, and thy Name, or rather what thy Name indicates, thy own true self. In default of thy actual presence, we desired to have thee ever in remembrance.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah26:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWith my soul have I desired thee in the night; yea, with my spirit within me will I seek thee early: for when thy judgments are in the earth, the inhabitants of the world will learn righteousness.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 9. - In the night; i.e. \"the long night of their affliction.\" The sentiment is identical with that of the preceding verse. Will I seek thee early; rather, did I seek thee. For when thy judgments, etc. It was not a mere selfish desire for the cessation of persecution that caused the righteous to long for the time when God's judgments would be manifested upon the earth, but a conviction that so only would an impression be made on the persecutors, and a certain number of them be induced to learn righteousness. A desire for the conversion of sinners to God characterizes God's saints generally, and none more than Isaiah, who is here expressing what he conceives will be the thoughts of the redeemed, and naturally judges their thoughts and feelings by his Own.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah26:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTLet favour be shewed to the wicked, yet will he not learn righteousness: in the land of uprightness will he deal unjustly, and will not behold the majesty of the LORD.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 10. - Let favor be showed to the wicked. This is a further explanation of the reason why the righteous had so earnestly desired the coming of God's judgments upon the earth. They had felt that further mercy and long-suffering wine thrown away upon the wicked, and \"only did them harm\" (Kay). When \"favor was showed them,\" they did but persist in unrighteousness. In the land of uprightness will he deal unjustly. Even good example does not convert the wicked man. Though he live in a \"land of righteousness,\" where God and his Law are acknowledged, where true religion is professed, where the gospel is preached, he will continue wicked, he will \"deal unjustly;\" he will not behold - or, consider - the majesty of the Lord.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah26:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTLORD, when thy hand is lifted up, they will not see: but they shall see, and be ashamed for their envy at the people; yea, the fire of thine enemies shall devour them.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 11. - When thy hand is lifted up, they will not see. The original is more graphic. It runs, \"Lord, thy hand is lifted up, [but] they see not. They shall see to their shame thy jealousy for thy people; yea, fire shall devour thy adversaries\" God's jealousy \"burns like fire\" (Psalm 79:9; Zephaniah 1:18) in the cause of his people.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah26:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTLORD, thou wilt ordain peace for us: for thou also hast wrought all our works in us.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 12. - Lord, thou wilt ordain peace for us; i.e. henceforth thou wilt give us an existence of perfect peace (see ver. 3), untroubled by adversaries. For thou also hast wrought all our works in us; rather, all our work for us. The \"work\" intended seems to be, as Mr. Cheyne observes, \"the work of their deliverance.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah26:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTO LORD our God, other lords beside thee have had dominion over us: but by thee only will we make mention of thy name.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 13. - Other lords. The saved had not always been faithful to Jehovah. Some, no doubt, had actually been idolaters, as many of the early Christians (1 Corinthians 12:2; 1 Thessalonians 1:9, etc.). Others had given their hearts for a time to other vanities, and turned away from God. Now, in the new Jerusalem, they confess their short comings, and acknowledge that only through God's mercy - by thee - are they in the condition to celebrate his Name.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah26:14VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThey are dead, they shall not live; they are deceased, they shall not rise: therefore hast thou visited and destroyed them, and made all their memory to perish.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 14. - They are dead, etc.; literally. Dead, they shall not live (i.e. return to life); deceased, they shall not arise. The power of the idol-gods is altogether passed away. It was for this end - therefore - that God had visited and destroyed them, and made their very memory to perish. How strange it seems that the \"great gods\" whom so many millions worshipped in former times - Bel, and Asshur, and Ammon, and Zeus, and Jupiter - should have passed so completely away as to be almost wholly forgotten!NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah26:15VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThou hast increased the nation, O LORD, thou hast increased the nation: thou art glorified: thou hadst removed it far unto all the ends of the earth.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 15. - Thou hast increased the nation; i.e. the \"righteous nation\" of ver. 2 - not the Jewish people merely, but \"the Israel of God\" - who are to be \"a great multitude, that no man can number, of all nations, and kindreds, and people, and tongues\" (Revelation 7:9). Thou hadst removed it. This rendering gives a very good sense. It makes the redeemed pass in thought from their present state of happiness and glory to that former time of tribulation and affliction when they were a remnant, scattered over the face of the earth (Isaiah 24:13-15), driven into its uttermost corners (Isaiah 24:16), oppressed and down-trodden by their enemies. But it is doubtful whether the Hebrew will bear the rendering. Most modern commentators translate, \"Thou hast extended far all the borders of the land,\" which is certainly the more natural meaning of the words. If we accept this view, we must regard the clause as continuing the idea contained in the former part of the verse - the nation is increased in number, and its borders are advanced - it is \"a multitude that no man can number,\" and it has no narrower limits than the \"new earth,\" which has been given to it for its habitation (Revelation 21:1).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah26:16VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTLORD, in trouble have they visited thee, they poured out a prayer when thy chastening was upon them.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 16. - Lord, in trouble have they visited thee. Here, at any rate, the redeemed go back in thought to their time of trouble. They remember that what brought them back to God from that alienation which they have confessed (ver. 13) was the affliction which they so long endured. Their present bliss is the result of their former woe, and recalls the thought of it. They poured out a prayer; rather, as in the margin, a secret speech, or a low whisper (Kay); comp. Isaiah 29:4. The word elsewhere means \"the muttering of a charm,\" but must here signify the \"whispered prayer\" of one in deep humiliation.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah26:17VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTLike as a woman with child, that draweth near the time of her delivery, is in pain, and crieth out in her pangs; so have we been in thy sight, O LORD.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 17. - Like as a woman with child (comp. Isaiah 13:8; Isaiah 21:3). Isaiah uses the metaphor to express any severe pain combined with anxiety. So have we been in thy sight; rather, so have we been at thy presence. When thou wert visiting us in anger, and laying thy chastisements upon us.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah26:18VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWe have been with child, we have been in pain, we have as it were brought forth wind; we have not wrought any deliverance in the earth; neither have the inhabitants of the world fallen.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 18. - We have as it were brought forth wind. Our pains have been idle, futile - have effected nothing. We have not given deliverance (literally, \"salvation\") to our land; we have not effected the downfall of our heathen enemies. That downfall was God's work (Isaiah 24:16-20).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah26:19VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThy dead men shall live, together with my dead body shall they arise. Awake and sing, ye that dwell in dust: for thy dew is as the dew of herbs, and the earth shall cast out the dead.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 19-21. - THE PROPHET'S COMMENT ON THE SONG OF THE JUST. Having concluded his \"song of the just\" in a minor key with a confession of human weakness, the prophet proceeds to cheer and encourage his disciples by a clear and positive declaration of the doctrine of the resurrection: \"Thy dead, O Israel, shall live.\" He then adds a recommendation for the present - a recommendation to privacy and retirement, until the judgments of God which he has predicted (Isaiah 24.) are shown forth upon the earth. Verse 19. - Thy dead men shall live. A universal resurrection of\" some to everlasting life, and some to shame and everlasting contempt\" (Daniel 12:2), is not yet announced; but only a resurrection of the just, perhaps only of the just Israelites. The object is encouragement, especially encouragement of those whom the prophet directly addresses - the religious Israelites of his own day. It is enough for them at the present time to know that, whether the day of the Lord comes in their time or no, when it comes, they will have a part in it. The assurance is given, and is made doubly sure by repetition. The prophet does not say, Together with my dead body they will arise; for there is nothing in the Hebrew corresponding to \"together,\" and the ellipse of 'ira, \"with,\" though suggested by Kimchi, is impossible; nor is it likely that he intends to speak of his own dead body at all. He may, perhaps, call the past generations of just Israelites \"my dead,\" i.e. the dead with whom he is in sympathy; or the supposed personal suffix may be merely paragogic, as Rosenmüller argues. In any case the two clauses must be regarded as identical in meaning - an instance of \"synonymous parallelism.... Thy dead men shall live; my dead shall arise.\" Awake and sing; rather, awake and shout for joy (comp. Psalm 35:27; Psalm 67:4, etc.). Ye that dwell in dust (comp. Daniel 12:2, \"Many that sleep in the dust of the earth shall awake\"). Thy dew is as the dew of herbs; i.e. refreshing, vivifying, potent to make even dead bones live. \"Thy dew\" may be said with reference to Jehovah, for changes in the person addressed are frequent in Isaiah; or with reference to the people of Israel, meaning, \"the dew which Jehovah will shed on thee,\" i.e. on thy dead.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah26:20VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTCome, my people, enter thou into thy chambers, and shut thy doors about thee: hide thyself as it were for a little moment, until the indignation be overpast.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 20. - Come, my people... into thy chambers. As when a storm comes, prudence counsels men to seek shelter (Exodus 9:19), so now the prophet advises his people to put themselves under cover during the coming tempest. His meaning, probably, is that they should retire into the privacy of communion with God, withdrawing from public affairs and the distractions of a worldly life. Shut thy doors about thee (comp. 2 Kings 4:33; Matthew 6:6). For a little moment (so in Isaiah 10:25; and again in Isaiah 54:7, 8). God's estimate of time, we must remember, is not as man's (Psalm 90:4; 2 Peter 3:8).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah26:21VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor, behold, the LORD cometh out of his place to punish the inhabitants of the earth for their iniquity: the earth also shall disclose her blood, and shall no more cover her slain.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 21. - The Lord cometh out of his place (comp. Micah 1:3). In the Psalms God is represented as \"bowing the heavens and coming down,\" bringing them, as it were, with him. Here (and in Micah) he quits his place in heaven, as a king quits his own country when he proceeds to take vengeance on rebels in another. The expressions are, both of them, accommodations to human modes of thought. To punish the inhabitants of the earth for their iniquity; literally, to visit the iniquity of the inhabitant of the earth upon him. The earth also shall disclose her blood; literally, her bloods; i.e. her bloodsheddings; the many murders committed by man upon her surface. Isaiah denounced \"murderers\" in his first chapter (ver. 27). Manasseh's murders were the main cause of the first destruction of Jerusalem (2 Kings 24:4). The second destruction was equally a judgment for the innocent blood that had been shed upon the earth, \"from the blood of righteous Abel unto the blood of Zacharias son of Bars-chins\" (Matthew 23:35). Bloodshed \"cries to God for vengeance\" (Genesis 4:10), and will be one of the main causes of the world's final destruction (Revelation 16:6; Revelation 18:20). And shall no more cover her slain. \"There is nothing covered that shall not\" in the last day \"be revealed, and hid that shall not be known\" (Matthew 10:26). Every murder, however secret, will be brought to light, and every murderer, however unsuspected previously, denounced and punished.NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINE","Isa.27":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah27:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTIn that day the LORD with his sore and great and strong sword shall punish leviathan the piercing serpent, even leviathan that crooked serpent; and he shall slay the dragon that is in the sea.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 1. - THE TRIPLE JUDGMENT ON THE POWERS OF DARKNESS. The crowning judgment of all is now briefly described. \"In that day\" - the day of God's vengeance - when all his other enemies have been put down, Jehovah shall finally visit with his sword three mighty foes, which are described under three figures - the first as \"Leviathan, the swift serpent;\" the second as \"Leviathan, the crooked serpent; \"and the third as \"the dragon that is in the sea.\" It has been usual to see in these three monsters three kingdoms inimical to God - either Assyria, Babylon, and Egypt; or Assyria, Egypt, and Tyre; or Media, Persia, and Egypt. But this diversity of interpretation shows that there is no particular fitness in the emblems to symbolize any special kingdoms or world-powers, while the imagery itself and the law of climax alike point to something higher than world-powers being intended. \"Leviathan,\" in Job 3:8, where the word first occurs, represents a supra-mundane power - probably \"the dragon, the enemy of light, who in old Eastern traditions is conceived as ready to swallow up sun and moon, and plunge creation in original chaos or darkness\" ('Speaker's Commentary,' vol. 4. p. 28); and the \"dragon\" is a customary emblem of Satan himself (Psalm 91:13; Isaiah 51:9; Revelation 12:7, 9), the prince of darkness. The triple vengeance here is parallel to the triple punishment, in the apocalyptic vision (Revelation 19:20; Revelation 20:10), of \"the devil,\" \"the beast,\" and \"the false prophet,\" who have been termed by commentators \"the three great enemies of God's kingdom\" (see 'Speaker's Commentary on the New Testament,' vol. 4. p. 802). Verse 1. - The Lord with his sore and great and strong sword. The \"sword\" of Jehovah is first heard of in the Pentateuch, where it is called\" glittering\" (Deuteronomy 32:41). It is spoken of by David (Psalm 7:12), and frequently by Isaiah (see Isaiah 31:8; Isaiah 34:5, 6; 46:16). Mr. Cheyne supposes the idea to have been taken from the Baby-Ionian mythology, and seems to think it half material. But it is merely on a par with other anthrepomorphisms. The word rendered \"sore\" probably means \"well-tempered,\" \"keen.\" Leviathan. Etymologically, the term \"Leviathan\" appears to mean \"that which is coiled\" or \"twisted,\" whence it would seem to have been primarily applied, as in the present verse, to serpents. In Job 41:1-34, however, it manifestly designates the crocodile, while in Psalm 104:26 it must be used of some kind of cetacean. Thus its most appropriate English rendering would be \"monster.\" The piercing serpent; rather, the fleet, or fugitive serpent. It is a general characteristic of the snake tribe to glide away and hide themselves when disturbed. Even leviathan that crooked serpent; rather, and also leviathan that crooked serpent. It is quite clear that two distinct foes of God are pointed at - one characterized as \"fleet,\" the other as \"tortuous.\" And he shall slay the dragon. Here is mention of a third enemy, probably Satan himself (see the introductory paragraph to this section).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah27:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTIn that day sing ye unto her, A vineyard of red wine.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 2-6. - GOD'S CARE FOR HIS VINEYARD. This piece may be called a companion picture to Isaiah 5:1-7, or a joy-song to be set over against that dirge. In both the figure of the vineyard is employed to express the people of God, and God is \"the Lord of the vineyard.\" But whereas, on the former occasion, all was wrath and fury, menace and judgment, here all is mercy and loving-kindness, protection and promise. The difference is, no doubt, not with God, \"with whom is no variableness, neither shadow of turning\" (James 1:17), but with the vineyard, which is either not the same, or, if the same, then differently circumstanced. The vineyard of Isaiah 5. is beyond all doubt the Jewish Church in the time of Isaiah, or in the times shortly after. The vineyard of the present place is either the Christian Church, or the Jewish Church reformed and purified by suffering. It is not the Church triumphant in heaven, since there are still \"briars and thorns\" in it, and there are still those belonging to it who have to \"make their peace with God.\" The prophet has come back from his investigations of the remote future and the supra-mundane sphere to something which belongs to earth, and perhaps not to a very distant period. His second \"song of the vineyard\" may well comfort the Church through all her earthly struggles. Verse 2. - Sing ye unto her. Our translators have, strangely enough, inverted the order of the two clauses, which stand thus in the Hebrew: \"A vineyard of red wine; sing ye unto it, \"or \"sing ye of it.\" The \"vineyard of red wine\" is one that produces abundance of rich fruit.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah27:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTI the LORD do keep it; I will water it every moment: lest any hurt it, I will keep it night and day.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 3. - I the Lord do keep it; or, guard it (comp. Isaiah 26:3; Isaiah 42:6; Isaiah 49:8; Psalm 121:5). Vineyards were considered to require special watching, since they were liable to damage both from thieves and foxes (Song of Solomon 2:15). It was usual to build towers in them, from which a watch could be kept (Isaiah 5:2; Matthew 21:33). I will water it every moment (compare the threat in Isaiah 5:6, \"I will command my clouds that they rain no rain upon it\"). The Church needs and receives \"the continual dew of God's blessing.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah27:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFury is not in me: who would set the briers and thorns against me in battle? I would go through them, I would burn them together.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 4. - Fury is not in me; i.e. \"I am not now angered against my vineyard, as on the former occasion (Isaiah 5:4-7); or at any rate my anger now is not fury.\" (Isaiah frequently ascribes \"fury\" to God, as in Isaiah 34:2; Isaiah 42:25; Isaiah 51:17, 20, 22; Isaiah 59:18; Isaiah 63:3, 5, 6; Isaiah 66:15.) Who would set the briars and thorns against me in battle? The \"briars and thorns\" are apparently unrighteous members of the Church, who have fallen below their privileges. God asks, \"Who will set the briars and thorns in array against me?\" in a tone of contempt. \"Who will dare to do battle against me with such weak material?\" And then he adds a forecast of the result in such a case: \"I would move forward; I would burn them all together\" (comp. Isaiah 10:17).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah27:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTOr let him take hold of my strength, that he may make peace with me; and he shall make peace with me.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 5. - Or let him take hold of my strength. There is another alternative. If the \"thorns and the briars\" are not prepared to contend in battle against God, let them adopt a different course. Let them \"lay hold of God's strength,\" place themselves under his protection, and make their appeal to him, and see if they cannot \"make their peace with him.\" A truly evangelical invitation! The enemies of God are entreated to cease from striving against him, and are taught that the door of repentance is still open to them. God is willing to be reconciled even to his enemies. Let them make peace with him, make peace with him. The reiteration constitutes an appeal of extreme earnestness and tenderness, which none could reject but the utterly impenitent.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah27:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHe shall cause them that come of Jacob to take root: Israel shall blossom and bud, and fill the face of the world with fruit.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 6. - He shall cause them that come of Jacob to take root; rather, in the days to come Jacob shall strike root. Jacob, lately the vineyard, is now compared to a single vine, which becomes strong by striking its roots deep into the soil, and then, as a consequence, blossoms and buds, and fills the face of the world with fruit. So the Israel of God, firmly rooted in the soil of God's favor, would blossom with graces of all kinds, and bring forth the abundant fruit of good works.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah27:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHath he smitten him, as he smote those that smote him? or is he slain according to the slaughter of them that are slain by him?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 7-11. - THE COMING JUDGMENT UPON JUDAH A CHASTISEMENT IN WHICH MERCY IS BLENDED WITH JUSTICE. A coming judgment upon Judah has been one of the main subjects of Isaiah's prophecy from the beginning. It has been included in the catalogue of \"burdens\" (see Isaiah 22.). It will have to be one of the prophet's main subjects to the end of his \"book.\" Hence he may at any time recur to it, as he does now, without special reason or excuse. In this place the special aspect under which the judgment presents itself to him is that of its merciful character,NEWLINENEWLINE(1) in degree (vers. 7, 8);NEWLINENEWLINE(2) in intention (ver. 9).NEWLINENEWLINEWhile noting this, he feels, however, bound to note also, that the judgment is, while it lasts, severe (vers. 10, 11). Verse 7. - Hath he smitten him; etc.? i.e. \"Has God smitten Judah, as he '(God) smote Judah's smiters?\" Judah's chief smiters were Assyria and Babylon. The judgments upon them would be more severe than that upon Judah. They would be destroyed; Judah would be taken captive, and restored. Them that are slain by him; rather, them that slew him (so Lowth, Ewald, Knobel, and Mr. Cheyne). But, to obtain this meaning, the pointing of the present text must be altered. The law of parallelism seems, however, to require the alteration.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah27:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTIn measure, when it shooteth forth, thou wilt debate with it: he stayeth his rough wind in the day of the east wind.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 8. - Our translators have entirely mistaken the meaning of this verse. The proper rendering is, In measure, when thou puttest her away, thou wilt contend with her; he sighed with his keen breath in the day of the east wind. \"In measure\" means \"with forbearance and moderation\" - the punishment being carefully adjusted to the degree of the offence. God was about to \"put Judah away\" - to banish her into a far country; but still he would refrain himself - he would \"not suffer his whole displeasure to arise,\" or give her over wholly to destruction. In the day of the east wind, or of the national catastrophe, when his breath was fierce and hard against his people, he would \"sigh\" at the needful chastisement. As Dr. Kay well says, \"Amid the rough and stern severity which he breathed into the tempest, there was an undertone of sadness and grief.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah27:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBy this therefore shall the iniquity of Jacob be purged; and this is all the fruit to take away his sin; when he maketh all the stones of the altar as chalkstones that are beaten in sunder, the groves and images shall not stand up.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 9. - By this; i.e. \"by the punishment inflicted.\" God accepts punishment as an expiation of sin; and this punishment of Judah was especially intended to be expiatory, and to remove at once his guilt, and the evil temper which had led him into sin. Its fruit would be a revulsion from idolatry, which would show itself in a fierce determination to destroy all idolatrous emblems and implements, altars, groves, images, and the like. This spirit was strongly shown in the Maccabee period (see 1 Macc. 5:44, 68 1 Macc. 10:84 1 Macc. 13:47, etc.). He maketh all the stones of the altar as chalkstones. A calcining of the stones into lime is probably intended. It was usual to subject the idolatrous objects to the action of fire, and then to stamp them into powder (2 Kings 23:4, 6, 11, 12, 15, etc.). The groves and images (comp. 1 Kings 15:13; 1 Kings 16:33; 2 Kings 17:10; 2 Chronicles 14:3; and see the comment on Isaiah 17:8).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah27:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTYet the defenced city shall be desolate, and the habitation forsaken, and left like a wilderness: there shall the calf feed, and there shall he lie down, and consume the branches thereof.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 10. - Yet the defensed city shall be desolate. Though her punishment is in mercy, as a chastisement which is to purge away her sin, yet Jerusalem shall for a time be desolate, void, without inhabitant, left like a wilderness. Forsaken; or, put away; the same word that is used in ver. 8 of Jerusalem. There shall the calf feed. A familiar image of desolation (comp. Isaiah 5:17; Isaiah 17:2; Isaiah 32:14, etc.).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah27:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWhen the boughs thereof are withered, they shall be broken off: the women come, and set them on fire: for it is a people of no understanding: therefore he that made them will not have mercy on them, and he that formed them will shew them no favour.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 11. - When the boughs thereof are withered, they shall be broken off. By a sudden introduction of metaphor, the city becomes a tree, the prophet's thought going back, perhaps, to ver. 6. \"Withered boughs\" are indications of internal rottenness, and must be \"broken off\" to give the tree a chance of recovery. Samaria may be viewed as such a \"bough,\" if the \"tree\" be taken as \"the Israel of God\" in the wider sense. Otherwise, we must suppose a threat against individual Judaeans. The women come. Weak women are strong enough to break off dead branches; they fall at a touch, and \"their end is to be burned\" (Hebrews 6:8). For it is a people of no understanding. It was folly, madness, to turn away from Jehovah, and go after other gods. Only through having \"no understanding\" could Israel have been so foolish (comp. Deuteronomy 32:28; 2 Kings 17:15; Jeremiah 4:22). He that made them... he that formed them (scrap. Isaiah 43. ], 7). God \"hateth nothing that he has made\" (Collect for Ash Wednesday). He made all men, but he \"made\" and \"formed\" Israel with exceptional care, and exceptional care leads on to exceptional love. Will not have mercy... will show them no favor; i.e. \"will not spare.\" No contradiction of vers. 7, 8 is intended. God will have \"measure\" and \"mercy\" in his punishment of Israel, but will not so have mercy as not to punish severely.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah27:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd it shall come to pass in that day, that the LORD shall beat off from the channel of the river unto the stream of Egypt, and ye shall be gathered one by one, O ye children of Israel.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 12, 13. - JUDAH PROMISED RESTORATION. The general practice of Isaiah is to append to gloomy prophecies words of encouragement He does this even when heathen nations are denounced (Isaiah 18:7; Isaiah 19:18-25; Isaiah 23:17, 18); and still more when he is predicting judgments upon Israel (Isaiah 2:2-4; Isaiah 6:13; Isaiah 10:20-34; Isaiah 24:23; Isaiah 29:18-24, etc.). The encouragement in this place is a promise of return after dispersion, and of re-establishment on the \"holy mount at Jerusalem\" (ver. 19). Verse 12. - The Lord shall beat off; i.e. \"gather in his harvest.\" The metaphor is taken either from the beating of olive trees to obtain the berries (see Isaiah 17:6), or from the beating out of the grain by a threshing-flail (Judges 6:11; Ruth 2:17; and below. Isaiah 28:27). Perhaps the best translation would be, The Lord shall thresh. From the channel of the river; rather, from the strong stream of the river. As usual, \"the river\" (hannahar) is the Euphrates (comp. Genesis 31:21; Exodus 23:31; Deuteronomy 11:24; Joshua 24:2, 3, 14, 15, etc.). Its \"strong stream,\" or \"flood,\" is contrasted with the scant thread of water which was alone to be found in the \"Torrens AEgypti.\" The stream of Egypt (nachal Mizraim) is generally allowed to be the modern Wady el Arish, which was appointed to be the southern boundary of the Holy Land (Numbers 34:5; 1 Kings 8:65). The Lord would collect within these limits all that were of Israel. He would also, as appears from the next verse, subsequently overstep the limits.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah27:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd it shall come to pass in that day, that the great trumpet shall be blown, and they shall come which were ready to perish in the land of Assyria, and the outcasts in the land of Egypt, and shall worship the LORD in the holy mount at Jerusalem.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 13. - The great trumpet shall be blown; rather, a great trumpet (comp. Matthew 24:31; 1 Corinthians 15:52; 1 Thessalonians 4:16). This imagery, and the return of the Israelites from Egypt and Assyria, point rather to the final gathering of Israel into the Church triumphant than to the return from the Babylonian captivity. Egypt and Assyria were certainly not the countries from which they came chiefly at that time. But they are the countries from which they will chiefly come when Jehovah \"sets his hand again the second time to recover the remnant of his people\" (Isaiah 11:11). The outcasts (comp. Isaiah 11:12).NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINE","Isa.28":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah28:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWoe to the crown of pride, to the drunkards of Ephraim, whose glorious beauty is a fading flower, which are on the head of the fat valleys of them that are overcome with wine!VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 1-4. - A WARNING TO SAMARIA. The prophet has now east his eagle glance over the whole world and over all time. He has denounced woe upon all the principal nations of the earth (Isaiah 13-23.), glanced at the destruction of the world itself (Isaiah 24:17-20), and sung songs over the establishment of Christ's kingdom, and the ingathering of the nations into it (Isaiah 25-27.). In the present chapter he returns to the condition of things in his own time and among his own people. After a brief warning, addressed to Samaria, he turns to consider the condition of Judah, which he accuses of following the example of Samaria, of perishing through self-indulgence and lack of knowledge (vers. 7-12). He then proceeds to expostulate seriously with the \"rulers of Jerusalem,\" on whom lies the chief responsibility for its future. Verse 1. - Woe to the crown of pride, to the drunkard; rather, of the drunkards, The \"drunkards of Ephraim,\" or of the ten tribes, were at once intoxicated with wine (Amos 4:1; Amos 6:6) and with pride (Amos 6:13). As the external aspect of affairs grew mere and more threatening through the advances of Tiglath-Pileser and Shalmaneser, they gave themselves up more and more to self-indulgence and luxury, lay upon beds of ivory, drank wine from bowls, feasted to the sound of the viol, and even invented fresh instruments of music (Amos 6:4, 5). At the same time, they said in their hearts, \"Have we not taken by our own strength?\" (Amos 6:13). They persisted in regarding themselves as secure, when even ordinary political foresight might have seen that their end was approaching. Whose glorious beauty is a fading flower; rather, and to the fading flower of his glorious beauty. The \"glorious beauty\" of Samaria was a beauty of magnificent luxury. \"Summer\" and \"winter houses,\" distinct each from the other (Amos 3:15); \"ivory palaces\" (1 Kings 22:39; Amos 3:15); a wealth of \"gardens, vineyards, fig-orchards, and olive yards\" (Amos 4:9); residences of \"hewn stone\" (Amos 5:11); feasts enlivened with \"the melody of viols\" (Amos 5:23); \"beds of ivory\" (Amos 6:4); \"wine in bowls\" (Amos 6:6); \"chief ointments\" (Amos 6:6); constituted a total of luxurious refinement beyond which few had proceeded at the time, and which Isaiah was fain to recognize, in a worldly point of view, as \"glorious\" and \"beautiful.\" But the beauty was of a kind liable to fade, and it was already fading under the sirocco of Assyrian invasion. Which are on the head of the fat valleys; rather, which is on the head (or, which decks the head) of the rich valley. Samaria was built on a hill of an oval form, which rose up in the midst of a fertile valley shut in by mountains. The prophet identifies the valley with the kingdom itself, and then personifies it, and regards its head as crowned by the fading flower of Samaria's beauty.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah28:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBehold, the Lord hath a mighty and strong one, which as a tempest of hail and a destroying storm, as a flood of mighty waters overflowing, shall cast down to the earth with the hand.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 2. - The Lord hath a mighty and strong one. God has in reserve a mighty power, which he will let loose upon Samaria. The wicked are \"his sword\" (Psalm 17:13), and are employed to carry out his sentences. In the present ease the \"mighty and strong one\" is the Assyrian power. As a tempest of hail, etc. The fearfully devastating force of an Assyrian invasion is set forth under three distinct images - a hailstorm, a furious tempest of wind, and a violent inundation - as though so only could its full horror be depicted. War is always a horrible scourge; but in ancient times, and with a people so cruel as the Assyrians, it was a calamity exceeding in terribleness the utmost that the modern reader can conceive. It involved the wholesale burning of cities and villages, the wanton destruction of trees and crops, the slaughter of thousands in battles and sieges, the subsequent massacre of hundreds in cold blood, the plunder of all classes, and the deportation of tens of thousands of captives, who were carried into hopeless servitude in a strange land. With the hand; i.e. \"with force,\" \"violently.\" So in Assyrian constantly (compare the use of the Greek χερί).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah28:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe crown of pride, the drunkards of Ephraim, shall be trodden under feet:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 3. - The crown of pride, the drunkards; rather, of the drunkards (comp. ver. 1). The \"crown of pride\" is scarcely \"Samaria,\" as Delitzsch supposes, it is rather the self-complacent and boastful spirit of the Israelite people, which will be \"trodden under foot\" by the Assyrians.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah28:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the glorious beauty, which is on the head of the fat valley, shall be a fading flower, and as the hasty fruit before the summer; which when he that looketh upon it seeth, while it is yet in his hand he eateth it up.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 4. - And the glorious beauty, etc. Translate, And the fading flower of his glorious beauty, which is on the head of the fat valley, shall be like an early fig (that comes) before the harvest. Such an \"early fig\" is a tempting delicacy, devoured as soon as seen (comp. Hosea 9:10; Nahum 3:12; Jeremiah 24:2, etc.). The \"beauty\" of Samaria would tempt the Assyrians to desire it so soon as they saw it, and would rouse an appetite which would be content with nothing less than the speedy absorption of the coveted morsel. Samaria's siege, once begun, was pressed without intermission, and lasted less than three years (2 Kings 18:9, 10) - a short space compared to that of other sieges belonging to about the same period; e.g., that of Ashdod, besieged twenty-nine years (Herod., 2. 157); that of Tyre, besieged thirteen years ('Ancient Monarchies,' vol. 3:492).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah28:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTIn that day shall the LORD of hosts be for a crown of glory, and for a diadem of beauty, unto the residue of his people,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 5, 6. - THE FALL OF SAMARIA COINCIDENT WITH AN OFFER OF FAVOR TO JUDAH. Her sister's fate was the most powerful of all possible warnings to Judah against treading in her steps. Samaria had perished through want of faith in Jehovah. She had turned to other gods; she had trusted in her own \"glory\" and \"beauty;\" and she had trusted in Egypt. If Judah would do the exact opposite, she might be saved. If she would take Jehovah for her \"Crown of glory\" and \"Diadem of beauty,\" he was willing to be so taken. He was willing to impart a \"spirit of judgment\" to her rulers, and \"strength\" to her armed force. Verse 5. - In that day shall the Lord of hosts be, etc. This is an offer, and something more than an offer. It is implied that, to some extent, the offer would be accepted. And clearly the closing of the clouds around Samaria was coincident with the dawn of a brighter day in Judah. Hezekiah came to the throne only three years before the fatal siege of Samaria began. His accession must have been nearly contemporaneous with that expedition of Shal-maneser against Hoshea, when he \"shut him up, and bound him in prison\" (2 Kings 17:4). Yet he was not daunted by his neighbor's peril. He began his reign with a political revolution and a religious reformation. He threw off the yoke of Assyria, to which his father had submitted (2 Kings 18:7), and he cleared the land of idols and idol-worship. It was the dawn of a day of promise, such as the prophet seems to point to in these two verses. Unhappily, the dawn was soon clouded over (vers. 7-9). The residue of his people; i.e. Judah. All admit that \"they also,\" in ver. 7, refers to Judah, and Judah only; but the sole antecedent to \"they also\" is this mention of the residue of God's people.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah28:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd for a spirit of judgment to him that sitteth in judgment, and for strength to them that turn the battle to the gate.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 6. - For a spirit of judgment. How far Judah had departed from the spirit of just judgment was made apparent in the very opening chapter of Isaiah's prophecy (vers. 15-27). To him that sitteth in judgment; rather, that sitteth on the judgment-seat (Cheyne). For strength to them that turn the battle to the gate; i.e. \"to those who repulse an enemy, and drive him back to his own city's gate\" (comp. 2 Kings 18:8, \"He smote the Philistines, even unto Gaza \").NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah28:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut they also have erred through wine, and through strong drink are out of the way; the priest and the prophet have erred through strong drink, they are swallowed up of wine, they are out of the way through strong drink; they err in vision, they stumble in judgment.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 7-10. - JUDAH'S SINFULNESS. The reformation effected by Hezekiah was but a half-reformation. It put away idolatry, but it left untouched a variety of moral evils, as:NEWLINENEWLINE1. Drunkenness. Judah was no whir behind Ephraim in respect of this vice. The very priests and \"prophets\" gave way to the disgusting habit, and came drunk to the most solemn functions of religious teaching and hearing causes.NEWLINENEWLINE2. Scorn and mockery of God's true prophets. The teaching of Isaiah was made light of by the officials of the priestly and prophetic orders, who claimed to be quite as competent to instruct men in their duties as himself. They seem to have ridiculed the mode of his teaching - its catch-words, as they thought them, and its insistence on minutiae. Verse 7. - They also. Judah, no less than Ephraim (see vers. 1, 3). It has been questioned whether literal intoxication is meant, and suggested that Judah \"imitated the pride and unbelief and spiritual intoxication of Ephraim\" (Kay). But the numerous passages which tax both the Israelites and the Jews of the period with drunkenness (Isaiah 5:11, 22; Isaiah 22:13; Isaiah 56:12; Hosea 4:11; Hosea 7:5; Amos 6:6, etc.), are best understood literally. Orientals (e.g, the Persians) are often given to such indulgence. Have erred through wine; rather, reel with wine. Are out of the way; or, stagger. The verbs express the physical effects of intoxication. The priest and the prophet. Priests were forbidden by the Law to drink any wine or strong drink previously to their taking part in the service of the tabernacle (Leviticus 10:9), and the prohibition was always understood to apply afortiori to the temple (Ezekiel 44:21). Prophets might have been expected to act in the spirit of the command given to priests. By \"prophets\" here Isaiah means, not persons especially called of God, but official members of the prophetical order. Of these there were always many in Judah, who had no strong sense of religion (see Isaiah 29:10; Jeremiah 5:13, 31; Ezekiel 13:2-16; Amos 2:12; Micah 3:11; Zephaniah 3:4, etc.). They err in vision; rather, they reel in the vision. They are drunken, even in the very exercise of their prophetical office - when they see, and expound, their visions. They stumble in judgment; or, they stagger when pronouncing judgment (Delitzsch). Persons in authority had been specially warned not to drink wine before the hearing of causes (Proverbs 31:4, 5).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah28:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor all tables are full of vomit and filthiness, so that there is no place clean.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 8. - So that there is no place clean.

A sudden and abrupt transition. The best explanation seems to be that suggested by Jerome, and followed by Bishop Lowth and most commentators, viz. that the prophet dramatically introduces his adversaries as replying to him with taunting speeches. \"Whom does he think he is teaching?\" they ask. \"Mere children, just weaned from their mother's milk, and taken away from the breast? Does he forget that we are grown men - nay, priests and prophets? And what poor teaching it is! What 'endless petty feazing'! (Delitzsch) - precept upon precept,\" etc. The intention is to throw ridicule upon the smallness and vexatious character of the prophet's interminable and uninterrupted chidings (Delitzsch). Knowledge... doctrine. Technical terms in Isaiah's teaching, which his adversaries seem to have ridiculed as \"catch-words.\" The term translated \"doctrine\" means properly \"tidings,\" and involves the idea that the prophet obtained the teaching so designated by direct revelation from God.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah28:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor precept must be upon precept, precept upon precept; line upon line, line upon line; here a little, and there a little:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 10. - For precept must be upon precept; rather, for it is precept upon precept (Lowth, Cheyne). The whole teaching is nothing but an accumulation of precept upon precept, rule upon rule, one little injunction followed up by another, here a little, there a little. The objectors profess to find in the prophet's teaching nothing grand, nothing broad - no enunciation of great leading principles; but a perpetual drizzling rain of petty maxims and rules, vexatious, cramping, confining; especially unsuitable to men Who had had the training of priests and prophets, and could have appreciated a grand theory, or a new religious standpoint, but were simply revolted at a teaching which seemed to them narrow, childish, and wearisome. It has been said that in the language of this passage \"we may hear the heavy babbling utterance of the drunken scoffers\" (Delitzsch); but in this we have perhaps an over-refinement. Isaiah probably gives us, not what his adversaries said of him over their cups, but the best arguments which they could hit on in their sober hours to depreciate his doe-trine. The arguments must be allowed to be clever.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah28:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor with stammering lips and another tongue will he speak to this people.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 11-13. - JUDAH'S PUNISHMENT. God will retort on the Jews their scorn of his prophet, and, as they will not be taught by his utterances, which they find to be childish and unrefined, will teach them by utterances still more unrefined - those of the Assyrians, which will be quite as monotonous and quite as full of minutiae as Isaiah's. Verse 11. - With stammering lips and with another tongue. The Assyrian language, though a Semitic idiom nearly allied to Hebrew, was sufficiently different to sound in the ears of a Jew like his own tongue mispronounced and barbarized.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah28:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTTo whom he said, This is the rest wherewith ye may cause the weary to rest; and this is the refreshing: yet they would not hear.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 12. - To whom he said; rather, because he said to them. God had from remote times offered to his people \"rest\" and \"refreshing\" - or a life of ease and peace in Palestine - but on condition of their serving him faithfully and observing his Laws (Deuteronomy 28:1-14). But they had re-jeered this \"rest,\" since they had refused to observe the condition on which it was pro-raised. Because they had thus acted, God now brought upon them war and a conqueror.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah28:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut the word of the LORD was unto them precept upon precept, precept upon precept; line upon line, line upon line; here a little, and there a little; that they might go, and fall backward, and be broken, and snared, and taken.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 13. - The word of the Lord was to them; rather, shall be to them. God will now speak to them, not by his prophet, but by the Assyrian conqueror, who will do what they said Isaiah had done, i.e. lay upon them command after command, rule alter rule, a constant series of minute injunctions, under which they will chafe and fret and at last rebel, but only to be \"snared and taken.\" It is uncertain whether the reference is to the immediate future and to the Assyrians proper only, or whether the Babylonians are not taken into account also, and their oppression of Judaea pointed to. The yoke of Babylon was probably quite as difficult to endure as that of Assyria; and we find that, in the space of eighteen years, it produced at least three rebellions.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah28:14VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWherefore hear the word of the LORD, ye scornful men, that rule this people which is in Jerusalem.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 14-22. - THE REBUKE OF JUDAH'S NOBLES. The power of the nobles under the later Jewish monarchy is very apparent throughout Isaiah's prophecy. It is they, and not the king, who are always blamed for bad government (Isaiah 1:10-23; Isaiah 3:12-15, etc.) or errors of policy (Isaiah 9:15, 16; Isaiah 22:15-19, etc.). Isaiah now turns from a denunciation of the priests and prophets, who especially opposed his teaching, to a threatening of the great men who guided the course of public affairs. He taxes them with being \"men of scorn\" (ver. 14), i.e. scorners of Jehovah, and with\" a proud and insolent self-confidence\" (Delitzsch). They have made, or are about to make, secret arrangements which will, they believe, secure Judaea against suffering injury at the hands of the Assyrians, and are quite satisfied with what they have done, and fear no evil. Isaiah is instructed that their boasted arrangements will entirely fail in the time of trial - their \"refuge\" (Egypt) will be found a refuge of lies (ver. 17), and the \"overflowing scourge\" (Assyria) will pass through the land, and carry all before it (ver. 18). There will then ensue a time of \"vexation\" and discomfort (vers. 19, 20) - God's anger will be poured out upon the land in strange ways (ver. 21). He therefore warns the rulers to lay aside their scorn of God, and humble themselves, lest a worse thing happen to them (ver. 22). Verse 14. - Ye scornful men; literally, ye men of scorn. The word used is rare, but will be found in the same sense in Proverbs 1:22 and Proverbs 29:8. A cognate participle occurs in Hosea 7:5. That rule this people. (On the authority of the nobles at this period, see the introductory paragraph.)NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah28:15VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBecause ye have said, We have made a covenant with death, and with hell are we at agreement; when the overflowing scourge shall pass through, it shall not come unto us: for we have made lies our refuge, and under falsehood have we hid ourselves:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 15. - We have made a covenant with death (comp. Job 5:23; Hosea 2:18). The words are a boast, expressed somewhat enigmatically, that they have secured their own safety by some secret agreement. The exact nature of the agreement they are disinclined to divulge. With hell are we at agreement. A \"synonymous parallelism,\" merely strengthening the previous assertion. When the overflowing scourge shall pass through. Assyrian invasion has been compared to a \"flood\" (Isaiah 8:7; Isaiah 28:2), and to a \"rod\" or \"staff\" in Isaiah 10:24. Here the two metaphors are joined together. It shall not come to us. Some means will be found - what, they do not say, either for diverting the flood, or for stemming it. For we have made lies our refuge. Here the Divine reporter departs from the language of those whose words he is reporting, and substitutes his own estimate of the true nature and true value of that \"refuge\" on which they placed such entire reliance. It appears by Isaiah 30:1-7 and Isaiah 36:6-9 that that refuge was Egypt. Now, Egypt was a \"bruised reed,\" not to be depended on for keeping her engagements. To trust in her was to put confidence in \"lies\" and \"falsehood.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah28:16VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTTherefore thus saith the Lord GOD, Behold, I lay in Zion for a foundation a stone, a tried stone, a precious corner stone, a sure foundation: he that believeth shall not make haste.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 16. - Behold, I lay in Zion for a foundation a stone. In contrast with the insecure refuge and false ground of confidence whereon the nobles relied, the prophet puts forward the one sure \"Rock\" on which complete dependence may be placed - which he declares that Jehovah is laying, or \"has laid,\" in Zion as a tried stone, a precious corner stone, a sure foundation. The imagery is, no doubt, drawn from the practice of Oriental kings, and notably Solomon, to employ foundation-stones of enormous size and weight at the corners of buildings. Some of those uncovered at the corners of Solomon's temple by the Palestine Exploration Fund are more than thirty-eight feet long, and weigh above a hundred tons (see 'Our Work in Palestine,' pp. 38, 115). But the reference cannot, of course, be to the material structure of the temple as Israel's true refuge. Rather, Jehovah himself would seem to be the Rock (Isaiah 26:4; Isaiah 30:29, etc.) intended; and hence the application to Christ by the writers of the New Testament (Romans 9:33; Ephesians 2:20; 1 Peter 2:6-8) was natural and easy. But it may be questioned whether the passage was to Isaiah himself \"Messianic,\" or meant more than that God had set his Name and his presence at Jerusalem from the time that the temple was built there, and that it was a mistake to look elsewhere titan to him for deliverance or security. He that believeth shall not make haste. The LXX. have \"He that believeth shall not be ashamed\" or \"confounded;\" and St. Paul (Romans 9:33) follows this rendering. It is conjectured that the Hebrew had originally yabish instead of yakhish.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah28:17VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTJudgment also will I lay to the line, and righteousness to the plummet: and the hail shall sweep away the refuge of lies, and the waters shall overflow the hiding place.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 17. - Judgment also will I lay to the line, said righteousness to the plummet; rather, justice also will I set for my rule, and righteousness for my plumb-line; i.e. I will execute justice and judgment on the earth with all strictness and exactness. The scorners had implied that, by their clever devices, they would escape the judgment of God (ver. 15). The hail (comp. ver. 2). The storm of Assyrian invasion will overwhelm Egypt, which is a \"refuge of lies,\" false and untrustworthy (see the comment on ver. 15). The hiding-place. Mr. Cheyne adds, \"of falsehood,\" supposing a word to have fallen out of the text. Such an addition seems almost required to complete the parallelism of the two clauses, and also for the balance between this verse and ver. 15.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah28:18VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd your covenant with death shall be disannulled, and your agreement with hell shall not stand; when the overflowing scourge shall pass through, then ye shall be trodden down by it.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 18. - And your covenant with death shall be disannulled; or, wiped out. The entire clever arrangement, by which they thought to avert the danger from themselves and from Judaea, shall come to naught. When the overflowing scourge shall pass through, then ye shall be trodden down by it. As the prophet continues, his metaphor becomes still more mixed. \"Treading down\" was so familiar an expression for destroying, that, perhaps, its literal sense was overlooked (comp. Isaiah 5:5; Isaiah 7:25; Isaiah 10:6; Daniel 8:13; Micah 7:10; Zechariah 10:5, etc.).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah28:19VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFrom the time that it goeth forth it shall take you: for morning by morning shall it pass over, by day and by night: and it shall be a vexation only to understand the report.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 19. - From the time that it goeth forth it shall take you; rather, as often as it passes along, it shall take you away; i.e. as often as the flood of Assyrian invasion sweeps through Palestine, it shall thin the population by death and captivity. We know of at least eight passages of the flood through Judaea - one under Sargon, two under Sennacherib, three or four under Esarhaddon, and two under Asshur-bani-pal. There may have been more. Morning by morning; i.e. frequently - time after time. Shall it pass over; rather, pass along, or pass through. It shall be a vexation only to understand the report; rather, it will be sheer terror to understand the doctrine. There is an allusion to ver. 9. They had thought scorn of Isaiah's \"doctrine,\" when he taught it them by word of mouth; they will understand it but too well, and find it\" nothing but a terror,\" when it is impressed on them by the preaching of facts.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah28:20VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor the bed is shorter than that a man can stretch himself on it: and the covering narrower than that he can wrap himself in it.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 20. - For the bed, etc. We have a proverb, \"As a man makes his bed, so must he lie in it.\" The Jews will have made themselves a bed in which they can have no comfort or ease, and consequently no rest. But they will only have themselves to blame for it.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah28:21VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor the LORD shall rise up as in mount Perazim, he shall be wroth as in the valley of Gibeon, that he may do his work, his strange work; and bring to pass his act, his strange act.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 21. - The Lord shall rise up as in Mount Perazim. The \"Mount Perazim\" of this passage is probably the same as the \"Baal-Perazim\" of 1 Chronicles 14:11, where David completely defeated the Philistines by the Divine help. This victory is connected with another over the same nation in the valley of Gibeon (1 Chronicles 14:13-16). Now, however, God was to be on the side of the enemies of his people, who were to suffer as the Philistines had suffered in the olden time. This punishment of Ida own people by the sword of foreigners was strange work on God's part - a strange act. But it was their strange conduct which caused God's strange action. They had become as it were, Philistines.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah28:22VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTNow therefore be ye not mockers, lest your bands be made strong: for I have heard from the Lord GOD of hosts a consumption, even determined upon the whole earth.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 22. - Be ye not mockers. As they had shown themselves previously (vers. 9, 10). Lest your bands be made strong; or, lest your fetters grow strong. The prophet views Judah as still, to some extent, an Assyrian dependency, held in light bonds; and warns his countrymen that an attempt to break the light bonds may result in Assyria's making them stronger and heavier. A consumption... determined upon the whole earth; rather, a consummation (comp. Isaiah 10:22, 23).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah28:23VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTGive ye ear, and hear my voice; hearken, and hear my speech.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 23-29. - A PARABLE TO COMFORT BELIEVERS. Isaiah is always careful to intermingle promises with his threats, comfort with his denunciations. Like his great Master, of whom he prophesied, he was fain not to \"break the bruised reed\" or \"quench the smoking flax.\" When he had searched men's wounds with the probe, he was careful to pour in oil and wine. So now, having denounced the sinners of Judah through three long paragraphs (vers. 7-22), he has a word of consolation and encouragement for the better disposed, whose hearts he hopes to have touched and stirred by his warning. This consolation he puts in a parabolic form, leaving it to their spiritual insight to discover the meaning. Verse 23. - Give ye ear (comp. Psalm 49:1; Psalm 78:1). A preface of this kind, enjoining special attention and thought, was appropriate to occasions when instruction was couched in a parabolic form.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah28:24VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTDoth the plowman plow all day to sow? doth he open and break the clods of his ground?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 24. - Doth the plowman plow all day? The Church of God, go often called a vineyard, is here compared to an arable field, and the processes by which God educates and disciplines his Church are compared to those employed by man in the cultivation of such a piece of ground, and the obtaining of a harvest, from it. First of all, the ground must be ploughed, the face of the earth \"opened\" and the \"clods broken.\" This, however, does not go on forever; it is for an object - that the seed may be sown; and, as soon as the ground is fit for the sowing to take place, the preparation of the soil ceases. Doth he open and break, etc.? Harrowing succeeds to ploughing in the natural order of things, the object of the harrowing being to break and pulverize the clods.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah28:25VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWhen he hath made plain the face thereof, doth he not cast abroad the fitches, and scatter the cummin, and cast in the principal wheat and the appointed barley and the rie in their place?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 25. - When he hath made plain the face thereof; i.e. leveled it - brought the ground to a tolerably even surface. Doth he not cast abroad the fitches? The Hebrew word translated \"fitches\" - i.e. \"vetches\" - is qetsach, which is generally allowed to represent the Nigella sativa, a sort of ranun-cuhs, which is cultivated in many parts of the East for the sake of its seeds. These are black, and have an aromatic flavor. Dioscorides (3:83) and Pliny (19:8) say that they were sometimes mixed with bread. And scatter the cummin. \"Cummin\" (Cuminum sativum) is \"an umbelliferous plant, something like fennel.\" The seeds - or rather, berries - have \"a bitterish warm taste, with an aromatic flavor\" ('Dict. of the Bible,' vol. 1. p. 372). They seem to have been eaten as a relish with various kinds of food. And cast in the principal wheat; rather, and put in wheat in rows. Drill-ploughs, which would deposit grain in rows, were known to the Assyrians ('Ancient Monarchies,' vol. 2. p. 198). And the rie in their place. Cussemeth, the word translated \"rie,\" is probably the Holeus sorghum, or \"spelt,\" which is largely cultivated in Palestine and other parts of the East, and is the ordinary material of the bread eaten by the poorer classes (see the 'Pulpit Commentary' on Exodus, pp. 219, 220). For \"in their place,\" Kay translates, \"in its own border.\" The wheat and the barley and the spelt would all be sown separately, according to the direction of Leviticus 19:19, \"Thou shalt not sow thy field with mingled seed.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah28:26VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor his God doth instruct him to discretion, and doth teach him.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 26. - For his God doth instruct him. Through the reason which God has given to men, they deal thus prudently and carefully with the pieces of land which they cultivate.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah28:27VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor the fitches are not threshed with a threshing instrument, neither is a cart wheel turned about upon the cummin; but the fitches are beaten out with a staff, and the cummin with a rod.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 27. - For the fitches are not threshed with a threshing-instrument. The Nigella sativa is too lender a plant to be subjected to the rude treatment of a threshing-instrument, or \"threshing-sledge.\" Such instruments are of the coarsest and clumsiest character in the East, and quite inapplicable to plants of a delicate fabric. Karsten Niebuhr thus describes the Arabian and Syrian practices: \"Quand le grain dolt etre battu, les Arabes de Yemen posent le bled par terre en deux tangles, epis center epis, apres quoi ils font trainer par-dessus une grosse pierre tiree par deux boeufs. La machine dent on se sert en Syrie consiste en quelques planches garnies par-dessous d'une quantite de pierres a fusil\" ('Description de l'Arabie,' p. 140). Neither is a cart wheel turned about upon the cummin. The allusion is to aim the coarse mode of threshing practiced in Palestine and elsewhere, by driving a cart with broad wheels over the grain. But the fitches are beaten out with a staff, and the cummin with a rod. Canon Tristram says, \"While the cummin can easily be separated from its case by a slender rod, the harder pod of the Nigella requires to be beaten by a stout staff\" ('Natural History of the Bible,' p. 445).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah28:28VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBread corn is bruised; because he will not ever be threshing it, nor break it with the wheel of his cart, nor bruise it with his horsemen.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 28. - Bread corn is braised; literally, bread; but no doubt the corn, from which bread is made, is meant. Most critics regard the clause as interrogative, \"Is bread corn bruised?\" - and the answer as given in the negative by the rest of the sentence, \"No; he will not continue always threshing it, nor crunch it with his cart-wheel and his horses - he will not bruise it.\" Even where the rougher modes of threshing are employed, there is moderation in their employment. Care is taken not to injure the grain. Here the main bearing of the whole parable appears. The afflictions which God sends upon his people are adapted to their strength and to their needs. In no case are they such as to crush and injure. Only such violence is used as is required to detach the good seed from the husks. Where the process is most severe, still the \"bread-corn\" is not \"bruised.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah28:29VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThis also cometh forth from the LORD of hosts, which is wonderful in counsel, and excellent in working.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 29. - This also (comp. ver. 26). This prudent dealing of the husbandman with his produce is the result of the wisdom implanted in him by God. The prophet goes no further, but leaves his disciples to draw the conclusion that God's own method of working will be similar. Wonderful in counsel (comp. Isaiah 9:6). Excellent in working; rather, great in wisdom (comp. Job 6:13: 12:16; Proverbs 2:7; Proverbs 3:21; Proverbs 8:14; Proverbs 18:1; Micah 6:9). Proverbs 8:14 is especially in point, since there the same two qualities are ascribed to God as in the present passage.NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINE","Isa.29":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah29:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWoe to Ariel, to Ariel, the city where David dwelt! add ye year to year; let them kill sacrifices.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 1-4. - A WARNING TO JERUSALEM. Expostulation is followed by threats. The prophet is aware that all his preaching to the authorities in Jerusalem (Isaiah 28:14-22) will be of no avail, and that their adoption of measures directly antagonistic to the commands of God will bring on the very evil which they are seeking to avert, and cause Jerusalem to be actually besieged by her enemies. In the present passage he distinctly announces the siege, and declares that it will commence within a year. Verse 1. - Woe to Ariel, to Ariel, the city where David dwelt! \"Ariel' is clearly a mystic name for Jerusalem, parallel to \"Sheshach\" as a name for Babylon (Jeremiah 25:26) and \"'Ir-ha-heres\" as a name for Heliopolis (Isaiah 19:18). It is generally explained as equivalent to Art-El, \"lion of God;\" but Delitzsch suggests the meaning of \"hearth of God,\" or \"altar of God,\" a signification which \"Ariel\" seems to have in Ezekiel 43:15, 16. But there is no evidence that \"Ariel\" was ever employed in this sense before the time of Ezekiel. Etymologically, \"Ariel\" can only mean \"lion of God,\" and the name would in this sense be sufficiently descriptive of the Jewish capital, which had always hitherto been a sort of champion of Jehovah - a warrior fighting his battles with a lion's courage and fierceness. Dwelt; literally, pitched his tent - an expression recalling the old tent-life of the Hebrews (comp. 1 Kings 12:16). And ye year to year; rather, a year to a year; i.e. the coming year to the present one. The intention is to date the commencement of the siege. It will fall within the year next ensuing. Let them kill sacrifices. The best modern authorities translate, \"Let the feasts run their round\" (Kay, Cheyne, Delitzsch); i.e. let there be one more round of the annual festival-times, and then let the enemy march in and commence the siege.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah29:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTYet I will distress Ariel, and there shall be heaviness and sorrow: and it shall be unto me as Ariel.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 2. - Yet will I distress Ariel; rather, and then will I distress Ariel. The sense runs on from the preceding verse. There shall be heaviness and sorrow. Mr. Cheyne's \"moaning and bemoaning\" represents the Hebrew play upon words better. The natural consequence of the siege would be a constant cry of woe. And it shall be unto me as Ariel. It would be better to translate, \"Yet she shall be unto me as Ariel.\" The meaning is that, though distressed and straitened, Jerusalem shall still through all be able by God's help to answer to her name of \"Ariel\" - to behave as a lien when attacked by the hunters.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah29:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd I will camp against thee round about, and will lay siege against thee with a mount, and I will raise forts against thee.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 3. - I will camp against thee round about; i.e. \"I will bring armed men against thee who shall encamp around the entire circuit of thy walls.\" There was small chance of forcing an entrance into Jerusalem on any side except the north; but, order to distress and harass her, an enemy with numerous forces would dispose them all round the walls, thus preventing all ingress or egress (see Luke 19:43). And... lay siege against thee with a mount; or, with a mound. Artificial mounds were raised up against the walls of cities by the Assyrians, as a foundation from which to work their battering rams with greater advantage against the upper and weaker portion of the defenses (see 'Ancient Monarchies,' vol. 2. p. 80). And... raise forts against thee. \"Forts\" were usually movable, and accompanied the battering-ram for its better protection. Archers in the forts cleared the walls of their defenders, while the ram was employed in making a breach (see Layard, 'Monuments of Nineveh,' Second Series, p. 21).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah29:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd thou shalt be brought down, and shalt speak out of the ground, and thy speech shall be low out of the dust, and thy voice shall be, as of one that hath a familiar spirit, out of the ground, and thy speech shall whisper out of the dust.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 4. - Thy speech shall be low. The feeble cries of a people wasted and worn out by a long siege are intended. These cries would resemble those which seemed to come out of the ground when a necromancer professed to raise a ghost. The Hebrew 'ohv is used both of the necromancers (Leviticus 19:31; Leviticus 20:6, etc.) and of the ghosts which they professed to raise (1 Samuel 28:7, 8; 2 Kings 21:6, etc.). Here the \"ghost\" is spoken cf. Thy speech shall whisper; literally, chirp (comp. Isaiah 8:19). The word used occurs only in Isaiah.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah29:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTMoreover the multitude of thy strangers shall be like small dust, and the multitude of the terrible ones shall be as chaff that passeth away: yea, it shall be at an instant suddenly.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 5-8. - THE WARNING FOLLOWED BY A PROMISE. It is ever God's care to prevent men from being \"swallowed up with overmuch sorrow\" (2 Corinthians 2:7). As long as he is not about to \"make a full end\" (Jeremiah 4:27), he mingles promises with his threats, words of cheer with words of warning. So now the prophet is directed to attach to his four verses of denunciation (vers. 1-4) four others of encouragement, and to declare the utter discomfiture of the vast host of enemies which for a time has besieged and \"distressed\" Ariel. Verse 5. - Moreover; rather, but. The relation of vers. 5-8 to vers. 1-4 is that of contrast. The multitude of thy strangers; i.e. \"of thy enemies\" (comp. Isaiah 25:5). In primitive societies every stranger is an enemy; and hence language - the formation of primitive men - often has one word for the two ideas. In Latin hostis is said to have originally meant \"foreigner\" (Cic., 'De Off',' 1:12). Shall be like small dust. Ground down, i.e. to an impalpable powder - rendered utterly weak and powerless. The meaning is determined by the clause which follows, with which it must necessarily be in close accordance. As chaff that passeth away. \"Chaff,\" in Scripture, is always a metaphor for weakness (comp. Isaiah 5:24; Isaiah 17:13; Isaiah 33:11; Isaiah 41:15; and see also Psalm 1:4; Psalm 35:5; Job 21:18; Hosea 13:3; Daniel 2:35; Zephaniah 2:2). It has no value; man's object is to get rid of it: a light wind carries it away, and no one inquires whither. Yea, it shall be at an instant suddenly. Dr. Kay says it is \"the collapse of Jerusalem\" which is here intended. But most other commentators understand, with more reason, the collapse of her enemies (Cheyne, Delitzsch, Vance Smith, Knobel, etc.).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah29:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThou shalt be visited of the LORD of hosts with thunder, and with earthquake, and great noise, with storm and tempest, and the flame of devouring fire.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 6. - Thou shalt be visited; literally, shall there be a visitation. On whom the visitation will fall is not expressed; but the context shows that it is on the enemies of Judah. The terrible nature of the visitation is signified by an enumeration of the most fearful of God's judgments - \"thunder, earthquake, great noise, whirlwind, tern-pest, and a flame of devouring fire.\" All the expressions are probably metaphorical.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah29:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the multitude of all the nations that fight against Ariel, even all that fight against her and her munition, and that distress her, shall be as a dream of a night vision.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 7. - Her munition; i.e. her defenses the walls and towers in which she put her trust (comp. ver. 3). As a dream of a night vision. \"The baseless fabric of a vision,\" when it has once passed by, \"leaves not wrack behind.\" The entire host of the \"terrible ones\" would melt away and disappear, as a night vision before the light of day - it would dissolve into nothing, vanish, leave no trace.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah29:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTIt shall even be as when an hungry man dreameth, and, behold, he eateth; but he awaketh, and his soul is empty: or as when a thirsty man dreameth, and, behold, he drinketh; but he awaketh, and, behold, he is faint, and his soul hath appetite: so shall the multitude of all the nations be, that fight against mount Zion.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 8. - It shall be even as when an hungry man dreameth. The melting away of the vision would involve a keen disappointment. The enemies of Israel had expected to secure a most valuable prey. They had dreamed of a rich booty when they should take the city - a booty which would reward them for all the hardships of their marches, their watches, their toils in the siege, the dangers to which they exposed themselves in the assaults. It was as if a hungry man had dreamed that he was engaged in a feast, or a thirsty man that he was drinking deep at a banquet, when suddenly he wakes up, and finds that he has been merely dreaming, and that there is no reality in his fancies. Dr. Kay quotes a passage which is much to the point from Mungo Park's journals: \"No sooner had I shut my eyes than fancy would convey me to the streams and rivers of my native land. There, as I wandered along the verdant bank, I surveyed the clear streams with transport, and hastened to swallow the delightful draught; but, alas! disappointment awaked me, and I found myself a lonely captive, perishing of thirst amid the wilds of Africa.\" Those engaged in the siege, while themselves vanishing away, would likewise find their dreams of plunder vanish, and Would bitterly feel the disappointment. That fight against Mount Zion. To attack Jerusalem was to fight against the mount of God, the place where Jehovah had \"set his Name, \"and where he condescended in some true sense to dwell continually. How could those who engaged in such an enterprise hope to succeed?NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah29:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTStay yourselves, and wonder; cry ye out, and cry: they are drunken, but not with wine; they stagger, but not with strong drink.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 9-12. - NEITHER WARNING NOR PROMISE COMPREHENDED BY THOSE TO WHOM THEY HAVE BEEN ADDRESSED, \"Who hath believed our report?\" says the prophet in another place (Isaiah 53:1), \"and to whom is the arm of the Lord revealed?\" It was among the most painful circumstances attaching to the prophetical office, that scarcely ever was the prophet held in any esteem among his own people, or in his own lifetime. Isaiah knows that his warning will fall dead - that the people and their rulers have neither \"eyes to see\" nor \"ears to hear.\" He places on record this knowledge, while at the same time striving if by any means he may arouse some from their condition of dull apathy. Verse 9. - Stay yourselves, and wonder; rather, stand stupefied and be astonished. The prophet bids them act as he knows that they will act. They will simply \"stare with astonishment\" at a prophecy which will seem to them \"out of all relation to facts\" (Cheyne). They will not yield it the slightest credence. They will only marvel how a sane man could have uttered such egregious folly. Cry ye out, and cry. Delitzsch and Mr. Cheyne translate, \"Blind yourselves, and be blind,\" which certainly gives a much better sense, and is justified by the use of the same verb in Isaiah 6:10. As Pharaoh began by hardening his own heart, and then God hardened it ('Pulpit Commentary' on Exodus, pp. 103, 166, 203, etc.), so those who blind their own eyes, and will not see when they have the power, are, in the end, if they persist, judicially blinded by God. They are drunken, but not with wine. \"The drunkards of Ephraim\" (Isaiah 28:3) were such literally. They \"erred through strong drink\" (Isaiah 28:7); they \"were swallowed up of wine;\" but the case was different with the infatuated ones of Judah. They were morally, not physically, intoxicated. Their pride and self-trust rendered them as irrational and as unimpressionable as ever drunkenness rendered any man; but they were not actual drunkards.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah29:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor the LORD hath poured out upon you the spirit of deep sleep, and hath closed your eyes: the prophets and your rulers, the seers hath he covered.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 10. - The Lord hath poured out upon you the spirit of deep sleep. \"Sleep,\" in Scripture, is sometimes \"rest,\" \"repose from trouble\" (\"So he giveth his beloved sleep,\" Psalm 128:2). But here it is \"spiritual deadness and impassiveness\" - an inability to appreciate, or even to understand, spiritual warnings. The Jews of Isaiah's time were sunk in a spiritual lethargy, from which he vainly endeavored to arouse them. This spiritual lethargy is here said to have been \"poured out upon them by Jehovah;\" but we are not to suppose that there was anything exceptional in their treatment - \"because they did not like to retain God in their knowledge, God gave them over to a reprobate mind\" (Romans 1:28), as he does men generally. Hath closed your eyes (comp. Isaiah 6:10; and see also Matthew 12:13; Mark 4:12; Luke 8:10; John 12:40; John 11:8, etc.). The prophets. As the text stands, the proper translation would be, \"For the Lord hath poured out upon you the spirit of deep sleep, and hath closed your eyes (the prophets), and your heads (the seers) hath he covered.\" But it is reasonably conjectured that the expressions, \"the prophets,\" \"the seers,\" are glosses, which have crept from the margin into the text (Eichhorn, Koppe, Cheyne). If so, they are probably mistaken glosses, the allusion being, not to particular classes, but to the actual \"heads\" and \"eyes\" of individual Hebrews, which were \"closed\" and \"covered\" by the judicial action of the Almighty. In the East a covering is often drawn over the head during sleep.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah29:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the vision of all is become unto you as the words of a book that is sealed, which men deliver to one that is learned, saying, Read this, I pray thee: and he saith, I cannot; for it is sealed:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 11. - The vision of all; i.e. \"the entire vision\" - all that Isaiah has put before them in vers. 1-8. As the words of a book that is sealed; rather, the words of a letter (marginal rendering) or writing. Written documents were often sealed up to secure secrecy, the sealing being done in various ways. When the writing was on a clay tablet, it was often enclosed in a clay envelope, so that the document could not be read till the outer clay covering was broken. Rolls of papyrus or parchment were secured differently. One that is learned; i.e. \"one that can read writing,\" which the ordinary Jew could not do, any more than the ordinary European in the Middle Ages. Neither the learned nor the unlearned Jews would be able to understand Isaiah's prophecy, so as to realize and accept its literal truth. They were devoid of spiritual discernment. Even the rulers were but \"blind loaders of the blind.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah29:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the book is delivered to him that is not learned, saying, Read this, I pray thee: and he saith, I am not learned.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 12. - Him that is not learned; i.e. \"that cannot read writing.\" Even in our Lord's day the ordinary Jew was not taught to read and write. Hence the surprise of the rulers at his teaching the people out of the Law (John 7:15, \"How knoweth this man letters, having never learned?\").NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah29:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWherefore the Lord said, Forasmuch as this people draw near me with their mouth, and with their lips do honour me, but have removed their heart far from me, and their fear toward me is taught by the precept of men:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 13. - Wherefore the Lord said; rather, moreover the Lord said. This people draw near me with their mouth. Samaria had been punished for open idolatry and flagrant neglect of Jehovah (2 Kings 17:7-17). Jerusalem had not gone these lengths. She still, in profession, clung to the worship of Jehovah, and had even recently accepted a purification of religion at the hand of Hezekiah, who had \"removed the high places,\" and cut down the groves, and broken in pieces the brazen serpent,\" because the people burnt incense to it (2 Kings 18:4). But her religion was a mere lip-service, which God detested - it was outward, formal, hypocritical (comp. Isaiah 1:11-17). Jerusalem, therefore, no less than Samaria, deserved and would receive a severe chastisement. But have removed their heart far from me. Here lies the gist of the charge. It was not that there was too much outward religion, but that there was no inward religion corresponding to it. Lip-service without inward religion is a mockery, though it is not always felt as such. Their fear toward me is taught by the precept of men. Mr. Cheyne conjectures that ritual books had been already published by the authority of the priests, and that these were followed, on account of the human authority which had issued them, without any reference to the Law. Thus ritual obedience became mere obedience to \"the precept of men.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah29:14VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTTherefore, behold, I will proceed to do a marvellous work among this people, even a marvellous work and a wonder: for the wisdom of their wise men shall perish, and the understanding of their prudent men shall be hid.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 14. - I will proceed to do a marvelous work. Commentators are not agreed what this \"marvelous work\" was. Some, with Delitzsch, consider it to be the hardening of the hearts of the Jews to such an extent that even the appearance of wisdom and understanding, which the rulers of the people had hitherto retained, would completely disappear. Others, with Mr. Cheyne, regard it as the coming siege, with those extreme sufferings and perils (vers. 3, 4) which the Jews would have to undergo - sufferings and perils barely consistent with the previous covenant-promises made to the nation. It is difficult to decide between these two views; but, on the whole, Mr. Cheyne's view seems preferable. A marvelous work and a wonder; rather, a marvelous work and a marvel. The repetition is for the sake of emphasis. For the wisdom; rather, and the wisdom; i.e. \"when I do my marvel, then the wisdom of the wise men shall perish\" - all their crafty designs and plans shall be of no avail, but come wholly to naught. The chief of these designs was that alluded to in the next verse.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah29:15VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWoe unto them that seek deep to hide their counsel from the LORD, and their works are in the dark, and they say, Who seeth us? and who knoweth us?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 15. - Woe unto them that seek deep to hide their counsel from the Lord. The allusion is to the schemes which were afloat for calling in the aid of Egypt. As Isaiah had long since denounced these schemes as the height of folly (Isaiah 19:11-17), and prophesied their failure (Isaiah 20:5, 6), every effort was made to conceal them from his knowledge end from the knowledge of all who were like-minded (comp. Isaiah 30:1, 2). Steps were probably even now being taken for the carrying out of the schemes, which were studiously concealed from the prophet. Their works are in the dark. Underhand proceedings ere at all times suspicious. \"Men love darkness rather than light, because their deeds are evil.\" The very fact of concealment was an indication that the works in which the rulers were engaged were evil, and that they knew them to be evil. They say, Who seeth us? (comp. Psalm 73:11, \"Tush, they say, How should God perceive? Is there knowledge in the Most High?\"). The wicked persuade themselves that God does not see their actions.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah29:16VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTSurely your turning of things upside down shall be esteemed as the potter's clay: for shall the work say of him that made it, He made me not? or shall the thing framed say of him that framed it, He had no understanding?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 16. - Surely your turning of things upside down shall be esteemed as the potter's clay; rather, O for your perverseness! Shall the potter be reckoned as clay? They were so perverse and wrong-headed that they inverted the relation in which they stood to God and God to them. God was to be passive, or merely give opportunities of action, and they were to mould their own plans and carve out their own destinies. For shall the work say, etc.? rather, for the work saith. Taking their destinies into their own hands was equivalent to saying that they were their own masters, which they could not be if God made them. Shall the thing framed say, etc.? rather, yea, the thing formed hath said. To refuse to take counsel of God, and direct the national policy by the light of their own reason, was to tax God with having no understanding.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah29:17VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTIs it not yet a very little while, and Lebanon shall be turned into a fruitful field, and the fruitful field shall be esteemed as a forest?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 17-24. - A RENEWAL OF PROMISE.

From the \"meek\" and \"poor' will be raised a body of true worshippers, who will possess spiritual discernment (ver. 18), while the oppressors and \"scorners\" will be brought to naught. When Isaiah expected this change is uncertain; but he holds out the hope of it here, as elsewhere so frequently (Isaiah 1:24-31; Isaiah 2:2-5; Isaiah 4:2-6; Isaiah 5:13, etc.), to keep up the spirits of the people and prevent them from sinking into a state of depression and despair. Verse 17. - Lebanon shall be turned into a fruitful field. Lebanon, the wild forest, shall become smiling garden-ground, while garden-ground shall revert into wild uncultivated forest. An inversion of the moral condition of Judaea is shadowed forth by the metaphor.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah29:18VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd in that day shall the deaf hear the words of the book, and the eyes of the blind shall see out of obscurity, and out of darkness.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 18. - In that day - i.e., when that time comes - shall the deaf hear the words of the book; the spiritually deaf shall have their ears opened, many of them, and shall not only hear, but understand, the words of Scripture addressed to them by God's messengers. No particular \"book\" is intended - sepher being without the article, but the words of any writing put forth with Divine authority. The eyes of the blind shall see also out of obscurity. Men shall shake off the \"deep sleep\" (ver. 10) in which they have long lain, and have once mute \"eyes to see\" the truth.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah29:19VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe meek also shall increase their joy in the LORD, and the poor among men shall rejoice in the Holy One of Israel.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 19. - The meek... the poor. The \"evangelical prophet\" anticipates the gospel in this, among other points - that he promises his choicest blessings, not to the rich and mighty, but to the poor and meek (comp. Isaiah 57:15; Isaiah 61:1).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah29:20VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor the terrible one is brought to nought, and the scorner is consumed, and all that watch for iniquity are cut off:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 20. - The terrible one... the scorner. \"The terrible one\" may be the foreign enemy, as in ver. 5, or, possibly, the native oppressor (Isaiah 1:23; Isaiah 5:93, etc.) - a still more tearful evil. \"The scorner\" is the godless man, who scoffs at religion (Isaiah 28:14, 22). Both classes would be \"consumed\" and \"brought to naught\" when the new state of things was established. All that watch for iniquity; i.e. \"all those who, for the furtherance of their iniquitous schemes, rise up early and late take rest, and eat the bread of carefulness\" (Psalm 127:2).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah29:21VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThat make a man an offender for a word, and lay a snare for him that reproveth in the gate, and turn aside the just for a thing of nought.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 21. - That make a man an offender for a word. The meaning of this clause is very doubtful. Kay translates, \"That lead men into sin by words;\" Mr. Cheyne, \"That make out people to be sinners by their words,\" i.e. by bearing false witness against them; while Delitzsch upholds the rendering of the Authorized Version. Mr. Vance Smith has other suggestions ('Prophecies,' p, 171). There seems to be, on the whole, no sufficient reason for setting aside the authorized rendering, which con-demus one form of oppression - the severe punishment of mere words. And lay a snare for him that reproveth in the gate. \"The gate\" was the place where judgment was given and public assemblies held. If any one boldly stood up and reproved the oppressors \"in the gate,\" they instantly set to work to lay a trap for him and bring him to ruin. And turn aside the just for a thing of naught; rather, and deprive the just [of their right] by empty charges. \"Turning aside the just\" means turning them from their right (Amos 5:12; Exodus 23:6); and bat tohu is not \"for nothing\" but \"by nothing,\" i.e. by some vain empty pretence.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah29:22VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTTherefore thus saith the LORD, who redeemed Abraham, concerning the house of Jacob, Jacob shall not now be ashamed, neither shall his face now wax pale.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 22. - The Lord, who redeemed Abraham; rather, who delivered Abraham, as the verb used is often rendered (see Job 33:28; Psalm 51:18; Psalm 69:18; Psalm 78:42, etc.). God's directions to Abraham to remove from a land of idolaters (Joshua 24:2, 3; Acts 7:2, 3) were practically a \"deliverance.\" The work thus commenced could not be suffered to remain incomplete. Israel - the true Israel - would not be ashamed, or wax pale through fear any more; they would be God's children, his true worshippers, and would have no need to experience either fear or shame.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah29:23VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut when he seeth his children, the work of mine hands, in the midst of him, they shall sanctify my name, and sanctify the Holy One of Jacob, and shall fear the God of Israel.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 23. - The work of mine hands; i.e. regenerated and \"created anew unto good works\" (Ephesians 2:10) - God's work, and no longer denying themselves to be such (ver. 16). They shall sanctify my Name, and sanctify, etc.; rather, they shall sanctify my Name, they shall even sanctify the Holy One of Jacob, and fear the God of Israel. The last two clauses are exegetical of the first (Kay).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah29:24VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThey also that erred in spirit shall come to understanding, and they that murmured shall learn doctrine.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 24. - They also that erred in spirit; i.e. those who were blind and deaf (ver. 18). Shall come to understanding; literally, shall know understanding; i.e. recover their power of spiritual discernment. They that murmured. The reference cannot be to the \"murmuring\" in Egypt, though the verb used occurs only elsewhere in Deuteronomy 1:27 and Psalm 106:25, where that murmuring is spoken cf. We must look for some later discontent, which we may find in quite recent \"murmuring resistance to the admonitions of Jehovah\" (Delitzsch), without going back so far as the time of the Exodus. Shall learn doctrine; i.e. \"shall willingly receive the teaching, of God's prophets, and profit by it.\"NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINE","Isa.2":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah2:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe word that Isaiah the son of Amoz saw concerning Judah and Jerusalem.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 1. - TITLE OF THE CHAPTER. It is generally allowed that the heading belongs, not to this chapter only, but to a section of the work, beginning here and ending at the close, either of Isaiah 4. or of Isaiah 5. It is probable that the section was originally published separately.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah2:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd it shall come to pass in the last days, that the mountain of the LORD'S house shall be established in the top of the mountains, and shall be exalted above the hills; and all nations shall flow unto it.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 2-4. - PROPHECY OF THE LAST DAYS. The resemblance of this prophecy to Micah 4:1-3 is so close as to necessitate the conclusion either that one of the two prophets copied from the other, or that both copied from an earlier document. The latter view, which is that taken by Rosenmüller, Maurer, De Wette, Meier, and Mr. Cheyne, seems preferable. Verse 2. - In the last days; literally, in the sequel of the days; but generally used of a remote future (Genesis 49:1; Numbers 24:14; Deuteronomy 4:30, etc.). The mountain of the Lord's house; i.e. the Church, the true Zion, which is to be the antitype of the existing Zion, and is therefore given its material attributes. Spiritually, it would be a \"mountain,\" as \"a city set on a hill,\" which \"could not be hid\" (Matthew 5:14); and again, as occupying a position from which it would command the whole earth. In the top of the mountains; rather, at the head of the mountains; i.e. with pre-eminence over them. The metaphor is drawn from the common physical fact of a high mountain range culminating in a single supreme eminence. So Mount Hermon towers above the rest of the Antilibanus, Demavend over Elburz, Rowandiz over Zagros. The \"mountains\" above which the true Zion shall tower are the kingdoms, or perhaps the religions, of the earth. All nations; literally, all the nations; i.e. \"all the nations of the earth\" (comp. Psalm 72:11). Shall flow; or, stream. A constant accession of converts from all quarters is intended. These are represented as continually streaming upward into the holy mountain of God's house.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah2:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd many people shall go and say, Come ye, and let us go up to the mountain of the LORD, to the house of the God of Jacob; and he will teach us of his ways, and we will walk in his paths: for out of Zion shall go forth the law, and the word of the LORD from Jerusalem.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 3. - Many people; rather, many peoples. Shall go; or, set forth. The prophet means to represent the nations as encouraging one another on the way. There is no jealousy among them, for the \"mountain\" can hold them all. He will teach us. The nations feel their ignorance of God, and their need of \"teaching.\" God alone can teach them concerning himself (Romans 11:33, 34; 1 Corinthians 2:10, 11); and \"he will teach\" them, either directly, as the Incarnate Son, or indirectly through those whom he has appointed to be \"teachers\" (1 Corinthians 12:28). Of his ways; i.e. \"some of his ways,\" not \"all of them;\" for at present \"we know in part\" only (1 Corinthians 13:9), and the greater portion of his ways are \"past finding out\" (Romans 11:33). The \"ways\" here spoken of are, no doubt, rules for the conduct of life, which are practically inexhaustible. God, however, will teach every man, who honestly seeks to learn, enough to enable him to \"walk in his paths.\" Out of Zion shall go forth the Law; rather, instruction, or teaching. The word (torah) is without the article. The instruction intended is that of the Church of God.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah2:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he shall judge among the nations, and shall rebuke many people: and they shall beat their swords into plowshares, and their spears into pruninghooks: nation shall not lift up sword against nation, neither shall they learn war any more.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 4. - He shall judge among the nations. This is clearly not yet fulfilled. How God shall ultimately \"judge among the nations,\" or rather \"between nation and nation,\" is a mystery which only the future can reveal. It has been supposed that \"by his providential retributions he will decide those international questions out of which war ordinarily springs\" (Kay). But it would seem to be at least as likely that he will bring the nations to such a pitch of wisdom and moderation, that they will voluntarily discard war, and agree to decide any disputes that arise by means of arbiters. The arbiter would then, like other judges, represent God, and \"by him decree justice\" (Proverbs 8:15). Shall rebuke. Rosenmüller translates, \"Arbiter pacts sit;\" Cheyne, \"shall arbitrate.\" Here again, as in ver. 3, \"people\" should be \"peoples.\" They shall beat, etc. On a sudden call to war, nations \"beat their ploughshares into swords, and their pruning-hooks into spears\" (Joel 3:10). They will do the reverse \"in the latter days,\" when God shall have \"made wars to cease\" (Psalm 46:9) and \"speak peace unto the nations\" (Zechariah 9:10).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah2:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTO house of Jacob, come ye, and let us walk in the light of the LORD.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 5-11. - THE CONTRAST OF THE PRESENT WITH THE FUTURE. Having shown to Israel the vision of a far-distant future, when holiness and peace would reign upon the earth, and \"the mountain of the Lord's house\" would draw all men into it, the prophet returns to things as they are - first exhorting Israel to \"walk in the light of Jehovah' (ver. 5), and then showing how far they have withdrawn from the light;NEWLINENEWLINE(1) by magical practices (ver. 6);NEWLINENEWLINE(2) by commercial greed (vers. 6, 7);NEWLINENEWLINE(3) by ostentation and luxury (ver. 7);NEWLINENEWLINE(4) by idolatry (ver. 8).NEWLINENEWLINESuch being the case, punishment must come - mean and great must be equally brought low (ver. 9) - the people must fly to their cave-fastnesses (ver. 10), and hide themselves; they must be humiliated to the uttermost (ver. 11). Verse 5. - O house of Jacob. \"House of Jacob\" is the common expression in Isaiah, instead of \"house of Israel\" (see Isaiah 8:17; Isaiah 10:20; Isaiah 14:1; Isaiah 29:22; Isaiah 46:3; Isaiah 48:1; Isaiah 58:1). It has no particular force, merely signifying \"Israelites.\" Come ye, and let us walk. The same words as those of the \"nations\" in ver. 3, \"Come ye, and let us go up.\" As the nations will invite each other \"in the last days,\" so the prophet now invites his countrymen to walk with God.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah2:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTTherefore thou hast forsaken thy people the house of Jacob, because they be replenished from the east, and are soothsayers like the Philistines, and they please themselves in the children of strangers.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 6. - Therefore; rather, for. The prophet, in calling upon Israel to \"walk in the light of the Lord,\" implies that they are not so walking. He then proceeds to give the reasons of this. They are not, \"for God has forsaken them, or, cast them off.\" The first reason is because they be replenished from the east (Revised Version, \"they be filled with customs from the east); i.e. they have adopted a number of Syrian, Assyrian, and Ammonite superstitions; e.g. high places, images, and \"groves,\" the burning of their children in honor of Moloch, the use of divination and enchantment, etc. (2 Kings 15:4; 2 Kings 16:3, 4; 2 Kings 17:10-12, 16, 17, etc.). Most of these practices reached the Israelites from Syria, though many had their origin either in Assyria or Babylonia. Soothsayers, like the Philistines. The \"diviners\" of the Philistines are mentioned in 1 Samuel 6:2. By the word here employed, it would seem that they foretold the future from observations on the clouds and the general appearance of the sky. During the reign of Uzziah, the Israelites had been brought into closer contact with the Philistines than usual, through his conquest of several of their cities (2 Chronicles 26:6). They please themselves in the children of strangers; literally, strike hands with the children of strangers (comp. Job 27:23). This is thought to refer to striking hands upon a bargain (Cheyne), and to be an allusion to the commercial activity of the reigns of Uzziah and Jotham (2 Kings 14:22; 2 Kings 16:6). But perhaps it does not mean more than familiarity.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah2:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTTheir land also is full of silver and gold, neither is there any end of their treasures; their land is also full of horses, neither is there any end of their chariots:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 7. - Full of silver and gold. The results of the commercial activity - not evil things in themselves, but probably acquired by sharp dealing, and leading to undue softness and luxury. The Law had given a warning against \"greatly multiplying silver and gold\" (Deuteronomy 17:17). For the fact of the vast abundance of the precious metals in Judaea at this time, see 2 Kings 14:16; 2 Kings 20:13; 2 Chronicles 32:27; and compare Sennacherib's inscription on the Taylor Cylinder ('Ancient Monarchies,' vol. it. p. 163, 2nd edit.). Full of horses... chariots (comp. Micah 5:10). There is no reason to believe that the Jews or Israelites ever possessed (unless it were under Solomon) any considerable cavalry or chariot force. But from the time of David horses and chariots were imported for convenience and for show by the kings, the princes, and the nobles (see 2 Samuel 15:1; 1 Kings 4:26; 1 Kings 10:28, 29; 1 Kings 22:31; Ecclesiastes 10:7). Like the silver and the gold, they were signs of luxury and ostentation.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah2:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTTheir land also is full of idols; they worship the work of their own hands, that which their own fingers have made:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 8. - Full of idols. The historians declare that both Uzziah and Jotham maintained the worship of Jehovah and disallowed idolatry (2 Kings 15:3, 34; 2 Chronicles 26:4; 2 Chronicles 27:2), so that we must regard the idol-worship of the time as an irregular and private practice. (It is, perhaps, alluded to in 2 Chronicles 27:2; and the fact of its prevalence is stated in Amos 2:1; Micah 5:13.) Perhaps Bishop Lowth is right in regarding it as mainly a continuation of the old private teraphim worship ('Notes,' p. 25).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah2:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the mean man boweth down, and the great man humbleth himself: therefore forgive them not.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 9. - And the mean man boweth down, etc. So Ewald and Kay; but most other commentators render, \"Therefore shall the mean man be bowed down, and the great man brought low, and thou shalt not [or, 'canst not'] forgive them\" (Rosenmüller, Lowth, Gcsenius, Knobel, Cheyne). The transition from narrative to threatening comes best at the beginning of the verse.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah2:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTEnter into the rock, and hide thee in the dust, for fear of the LORD, and for the glory of his majesty.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 10. - Enter into the rock. The limestone rocks of Palestine are full of extensive caverns, to which the Israelites often betook themselves in times of danger (see Judges 6:2; 1 Samuel 13:6; 1 Samuel 22:1, etc.). The prophet exhorts them to flee thither now, but without stating what exactly is the peril (comp. vers. 19, 21). Hide thee in the dust. Not \"the dust of humiliation\" (Kay), but \"the dust of the earth\" (Genesis 2:7), put here for the earth itself, as in ver. 19. For fear of the Lord; rather, from before the terror of Jehovah. Some awful manifestation of Jehovah's power is intended, its nature being still kept back and shrouded in darkness.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah2:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe lofty looks of man shall be humbled, and the haughtiness of men shall be bowed down, and the LORD alone shall be exalted in that day.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 11. - The effect of the judgment which, in ver. 9, was said to be the humiliation of high and low alike, is here declared with special reference to the high-minded and proud, whom it will humble more than others. The Lord alone shall be exalted; like a lofty and strong tower (comp. Isaiah 12:4; Isaiah 33:5).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah2:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor the day of the LORD of hosts shall be upon every one that is proud and lofty, and upon every one that is lifted up; and he shall be brought low:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 12-22. - THE DESCRIPTION OF THE DAY OF THE LORD. The prophet, now, having announced that God is about to visit his people in anger (vers. 10, 11), proceeds to describe in highly rhetorical language the visitation itself,NEWLINENEWLINE(1) as to its object, which is to bring down all that exalts itself against God (ver. 12);NEWLINENEWLINE(2) as to its scope - it is to be upon trees, mountains, hills, towers, walls, ships, pleasant pictures, idols (vers. 13-18);NEWLINENEWLINE(3) as to its practical effect, which will be to alarm and terrify, to make men fly and hide themselves, and to produce contempt of the idols in which they have so long trusted (vers. 19-21). Verse 12. - For the day of the Lord of hosts shall be upon every one; rather, For the Lord of hosts shall have a day upon everything. The passage is exegetical of \"that day\" in the preceding verse. A \"day\" - or time - is certainly coming which shall be emphatically \"the Lord's\" - a day on which he will descend to judgment. Proud... lofty... lifted up (comp. ver. 11). \"The ideas of eminence, pride, and opposition to God melt into each other in the Old Testament\" (Cheyne). And he shall be brought low; rather, that it may be brought low (so Gesenius and Cheyne).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah2:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd upon all the cedars of Lebanon, that are high and lifted up, and upon all the oaks of Bashan,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 13. - Upon all the cedars of Lebanon. It is usual to take this metaphorically; and no doubt men are often compared to trees in Scripture (Psalm 1:3; Jeremiah 17:8; Job 8:16, 17), and \"cedars of Lebanon\" especially are symbols of the great and proud ones (Ezekiel 31:3). But it has been well observed that either all the details of the description in the text must be taken literally, or all of them metaphorically, and that the mention of such objects as \"ships of Tarshish\" and \"pleasant pictures\" pleads strongly for a literal interpretation. The day of the Lord was upon the cedars when Sennacherib \"with chariots upon chariots came up to the height of the mountains, to the sides of Lebanon, and cut down the tall cedars thereof, and the choice fir trees thereof\" (Isaiah 37:24); and similar devastation accompanied, it is probable, the other invasions of the Assyrians (see 'Ancient Monarchies,' vol. 1. pp. 474, 475). Upon all the oaks of Bashan. The \"oaks of Bashan\" are celebrated also by Ezekiel (Ezekiel 27:6) and by Zechariah (Zechariah 11:2). It is quite likely that the Assyrians cut timber in Bashan, as they did in Lebanon and Amanus.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah2:14VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd upon all the high mountains, and upon all the hills that are lifted up,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 14. - Mountains... hills. It is Sennacherib's boast that he \"came up to the height of the mountains\" (Isaiah 37:24).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah2:15VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd upon every high tower, and upon every fenced wall,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 15. - Upon every high tower. Uzziah and. Jotham had, both of them, paid much attention to fortifications, and had especially \"built towers,\" both at Jerusalem and in other parts of Judaea (2 Chronicles 26:9, 10; 2 Chronicles 27:4). Isaiah means to pour contempt on these indications of \"trust in an arm of flesh,\" and to say that they will be of no avail when the time of calamity arrives. Every fenced wall. \"On the wall of Ophel\" Jotham had \"built much\" (2 Chronicles 27:3). Hosea (Hosea 8:14) and Micah (Micah 4:11) also notice the trust of Judah in her fortresses, and threaten their destruction.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah2:16VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd upon all the ships of Tarshish, and upon all pleasant pictures.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 16. - All the ships of Tarshish. \"Ships of Tarshish\" meant originally \"ships built to sail to Tarshish;\" but was used by the later writers for ships of a certain class or size (1 Kings 22:48; Psalm 48:7; Ezekiel 27:25). Tarshish was Tartessus, in Spain, and voyages thither were regarded as long and dangerous (Herod., 1:163). Consequently, the ships which were built for the Tartessian trade were of unusual size and strength. Uzziah had \"built [i.e. rebuilt] Elath,\" in the eastern arm of the Red Sea, early in his reign (2 Kings 14:22), and no doubt maintained a fleet there, as Jehoshaphat had done (1 Kings 22:48). Elath remained in the possession of the Jews till the reign of Ahaz, when it was taken by Rezin, and restored to Edom (see 'Speaker's Commentary' on 2 Kings 16:6). Upon all pleasant pictures; Revised Version, all pleasant imagery. The exact word here translated \"pictures\" does not occur elsewhere in the Old Testament; but a cognate word is not uncommon. From the passages in which this cognate word occurs (especially Leviticus 26:1; Numbers 33:52; Proverbs 25:11; Ezekiel 8:12), it is concluded that works of art, of some sort or other, are intended. More than this can scarcely be determined. Dr. Kay thinks the term to include \"sculptures and fresco-paintings.\" Mr. Cheyne translates \"all delightful works of imagery.\" The sentiment is that the judgment of God will fall on the most valued contents of palaces and grand houses, no less than upon the forests and the mountains, the fortified places, and the national navy. All wilt be involved in one sweeping destruction.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah2:17VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the loftiness of man shall be bowed down, and the haughtiness of men shall be made low: and the LORD alone shall be exalted in that day.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 17. - The loftiness of man. This verse interrupts the sequence of the thoughts somewhat awkwardly. It is a sort of refrain (see ver. 11; and for the use of refrains in Hebrew poetry, see Exodus 15:1, 21; Psalm evil. 8, 15, 21, 31), and perhaps comes in for rhythmical reasons, to the detriment of the sense.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah2:18VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the idols he shall utterly abolish.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 18. - And the idols he shall utterly abolish; rather, and the idols shall utterly pass away. While the visitation shall fall only partially on the other objects precious to Israel - the cedars, the oaks, the terraced mountains and hills, the strongholds, the ships, and the works of art - the idols shall be wholly swept away by it. It is impossible to say what visitation exactly was in the prophet's mind; but if we may suppose that the Babylonian captivity came within the range of the prophetic vision, we must pronounce the prediction to have received a very remarkable fulfillment in this matter, since that calamity did put an entire end to the idolatry of the nation.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah2:19VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd they shall go into the holes of the rocks, and into the caves of the earth, for fear of the LORD, and for the glory of his majesty, when he ariseth to shake terribly the earth.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 19. - They shall go into the holes of the rooks, etc. (see ver. 10, which is an exhortation to do what this verse declares will be done). On the abundant caves of Palestine, see note on the former passage. To shake terribly the earth; literally, to affright the earth. It is not said in what way he will affright it. The cognate Arabic verb has the meaning \"to shake;\" but it is not clear that the Hebrew one has ever this sense.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah2:20VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTIn that day a man shall cast his idols of silver, and his idols of gold, which they made each one for himself to worship, to the moles and to the bats;VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 20. - In that day a man shall cast, etc, When the idols disappoint their worship-pets, and prove to be unable to save them, they are treated with scorn and ignominy. The African beats his fetish on such occasions. The Israelites would fling theirs to the moles and the bats. Idols of silver... idols of gold (comp. Exodus 20:23; Psalm 115:4: 135:15; Isaiah 30:22; Isaiah 31:7; Hosea 8:4; Hosea 13:2). A passage of Habakkuk (Habakkuk 2:19) shows that sometimes the main bulk of the idol was of stone, which was overlaid with a coating of one or other of the two precious metals; but it would seem that ordinarily the entire image was either of gold or silver (comp. Exodus 32:4, 24; 1 Kings 12:28). No doubt it was thought that the god worshipped through the image was more honored, and therefore better pleased, by the more costly material. Which they made each one for himself; rather, which they (i.e. the manufacturers) have made for him. Idol-making was a trade, as we see by the Acts of the Apostles (Acts 19:24-27). To the moles; literally, to the dig-holes. The metaphor must not be pressed. They would throw the idols into holes and corners, pits and caverns, where moles and bats might be expected to be the only visitants. Some idea of the blindness implied in any regard for idols may have prompted the imagery.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah2:21VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTTo go into the clefts of the rocks, and into the tops of the ragged rocks, for fear of the LORD, and for the glory of his majesty, when he ariseth to shake terribly the earth.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 21. - To go into; or, as they go into; i.e. \"as they make their escape, they shall fling the idols away.\" The clefts of the rocks (comp. Exodus 33:22, the only other passage of Scripture where the word occurs). The tops of the ragged rocks; rather, the rents, or crevices. The idea of hiding themselves from the awful majesty of God is kept up throughout (cf. vers. 10 and 19; and see also Luke 23:30).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah2:22VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTCease ye from man, whose breath is in his nostrils: for wherein is he to be accounted of?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 22. - Cease ye from man. This verse is regarded by many as a late marginal note, which has accidentally crept into the text (Diestel, Studer, Cheyne). It is omitted in the Septuagint, and interrupts the sequence of Isaiah 3. on Isaiah 2. somewhat awkwardly. If retained, it must be regarded as an appeal to Israel on the part of the prophet to give up their trust in man, whence had flowed all their other errors. Whose breath is in his nostrils; i.e. \"whose life is a mere breath; who, if he ceases to breathe, ceases to live.\" For wherein is he to be accounted of? or, for of what account is he? Surely, of no account at all.NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINE","Isa.30":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah30:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWoe to the rebellious children, saith the LORD, that take counsel, but not of me; and that cover with a covering, but not of my spirit, that they may add sin to sin:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 1. - Woe to the rebellious children (comp. Isaiah 1:23; Isaiah 65:2). The word translated \"rebellious\" is used in Deuteronomy 21:18, 20 of the persistently disobedient son, who was to be brought before the elders and stoned to death. That take counsel; rather, that form plans, such as the plan now formed to call in the aid of Egypt. It must be borne in mind that, under the theocracy, there was an authorized mode of consulting God, and receiving an answer from him, in any political emergency. That cover with a covering. The exact metaphor employed is uncertain, Mr. Cheyne renders, \"that weave a web;\" Dr. Kay, \"that pour out a molten image.\" The meaning, however, in any case is, \"that carry out a design,\" the clause being a mere variant of the preceding one. That they may add sin to sin; i.e. \"to add a fresh sin to all their former sins.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah30:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThat walk to go down into Egypt, and have not asked at my mouth; to strengthen themselves in the strength of Pharaoh, and to trust in the shadow of Egypt!VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 2. - That walk; or, are on their way (comp. Isaiah 31:1). Either the Jewish ambassadors have already started, or the anticipatory vision of the prophet sees them as if starting. In the history (2 Kings 18:13-37; Isaiah 36:1-22) it is not expressly said that Hezekiah made application to Egypt for aid; but the reproaches of Rabshakeh (2 Kings 18:21, 24) would be pointless if he had not done so. Have not asked at my mouth. As they ought to have done (see Numbers 27:21; Judges 1:1; Judges 20:18; 1 Samuel 23:2; 1 Kings 22:7, etc.). To strengthen themselves in the strength of Pharaoh. It is very uncertain who is the \"Pharaoh\" here intended. The supreme power over Egypt was probably, at the time, in the hands of Tirkakah (2 Kings 19:9); but Lower Egypt seems to have been ruled by various princes, the chief of whom was Shabatok, and any one of these may have been regarded by Isaiah as a \"Pharaoh.\" To trust in the shadow of Egypt. Trust in the \"shadow of God\" was an expression very familiar to the Jews (see Psalm 17:8; Psalm 36:7; Psalm 63:7; Psalm 91:1; Isaiah 25:4; Isaiah 32:2). To \"trust in the shadow of Egypt\" was to put Egypt in the place of God.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah30:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTTherefore shall the strength of Pharaoh be your shame, and the trust in the shadow of Egypt your confusion.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah30:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor his princes were at Zoan, and his ambassadors came to Hanes.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 4. - His princes were at Zoan. \"Zoan\" is undoubtedly Tanis, which is now \"San,\" a heap of ruins in the Delta, where some interesting remains of the shepherd-kings have been discovered. It was a favorite capital of the monarchs of the nineteenth dynasty, and seems to have been the scene of the struggle between Moses and the Pharaoh of the Exodus (Psalm 78:12, 43). It then declined, but is said to have been the birthplace of the first king of the twenty-first dynasty. In the Ethiopian period it rose once more to some importance, and was at one time the capital of a principality (see G. Smith's 'Asshur-bani-pal,' pp. 21, 26, 32). The \"princes\" here spoken of are probably Hezekiah's ambassadors. His ambassadors came to Hanes. \"Hanes\" has been generally identified with the modern Esnes, a village between Memphis and Thebes, which is thought to mark the site of Hera-cleopolis Magna. But it has been well remarked that the Jewish envoys would scarcely have proceeded so far. Mr. R.S. Peele suggests, instead of Esnes, Tahpenes, or Daphnae ('Dict. of the Bible,' vol. 1. p. 753); but that name is somewhat remote from Hanes. Perhaps it would be best to acknowledge that \"Hanes\" cannot at present be identified. It was probably not very far from Tanis.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah30:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThey were all ashamed of a people that could not profit them, nor be an help nor profit, but a shame, and also a reproach.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 5. - They were all ashamed; rather, all are ashamed. The reference is not to the ambassadors, who felt no shame in their embassy, and probably returned elated by the promises made them; but to the subsequent feelings of the Jewish nation, when it was discovered by sad experience that no reliance was to be placed on \"the strength of Pharaoh.\" A people that could not profit them. Mr. Cheyne compares, very pertinently, an inscription of Sargon's, where he says of the people of Philistia, Judah, Edom, and Moab, that \"they and their evil chiefs, to fight against me, unto Pharaoh, King of Egypt, a monarch who could not save them, their presents carried, and besought his alliance\" (G. Smith, 'Eponym Canon,' p. 130, II. 35-39). Egypt was, in fact, quite unable to cope with Assyria, and knew it. A shame, and also a reproach. A matter of which they would themselves be \"ashamed,\" and with which the Assyrians would \"reproach\" them (as they did, 2 Kings 18:21, 24).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah30:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe burden of the beasts of the south: into the land of trouble and anguish, from whence come the young and old lion, the viper and fiery flying serpent, they will carry their riches upon the shoulders of young asses, and their treasures upon the bunches of camels, to a people that shall not profit them.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 6. - Burden of the beasts of the south. Delitzsch thinks that the Egyptians are intended by the \"beasts of the south\" - the expression pointing primarily to the hippopotamus, which was an apt emblem of the slow-moving Egyptians. But most commentators regard the \"beasts\" of this clause as equivalent to the \"young asses and camels\" mentioned towards the end of the verse. (On the sense of the word \"burden,\" see the introductory paragraph to Isaiah 13.) Into the lane of trouble and anguish; rather, through a laud. It is not Egypt that is spoken of, but the desert between Judaea and Egypt. The reminiscences of this desert were such that the Israelites always exaggerated its terrors and dangers (see Deuteronomy 8:15; Jeremiah 2:6). From whence come the young and old lion; rather, the lioness and the lion (see 'Speaker's Commentary' on Genesis 49:9; vol. 1. p. 227). Lions can never have been numerous in the tract in question; but they may have haunted portions of it, when it was better watered than at present. The viper and fiery flying serpent. Snakes of various kinds have always been abundant in the desert between Judaea and Egypt (Numbers 21:6; Strab., 16. p. 759; Schubert,' Travels,' sol. it. p. 406; Burckhardt, 'Travels,' p. 499, etc.). Seine of them were believed anciently to have wings (Herod., 2:75; 3:107); but the fact is doubted. Isaiah is not concerned with natural history, but with definitely marking out the locality through which the ambassadors would march. For this purpose it was best to describe it in terms drawn from the popular belief. Their riches... their treasures. Ambassadors who came to request military aid, as a matter of course carried rich presents with them. Young asses... camels. The ordinary beasts of burden employed in the passage of the desert (Genesis 37:25; Genesis 42:26; Herod., 3:9, etc.).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah30:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor the Egyptians shall help in vain, and to no purpose: therefore have I cried concerning this, Their strength is to sit still.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 7. - Therefore have I cried concerning this. Their strength is to sit still. No modern critic accepts this interpretation. Most translate, \"Wherefore I name it\" (i.e. Egypt) \"Rahab, that sits still;\" or \"Arrogance, that 'sits still.\" Rahab, \"pride\" or 'arrogance,\" would seem to have been an old name for Egypt (Job 26:12; Psalm 87:4; Psalm 89:10; Isaiah 51:9), not one given at this time by Isaiah. What he means to say is, \"Proud as thou art, thou doest nothing to maintain thy pride, but art content with sitting still.\" This he \"cries\" or \"proclaims\" concerning Egypt, as the most important thing for other nations to know about her.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah30:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTNow go, write it before them in a table, and note it in a book, that it may be for the time to come for ever and ever:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 8-17. - A RENEWAL OF THREATENING. The denunciation of the Egyptian alliance had been made viva voce, in the courts of the temple or in some other place of public resort. As he ended, Isaiah received a Divine intimation that the prophecy was to be put on record, doubly, upon a tablet and in a book. At the same time, the \"rebelliousness\" of the people was further pointed out, and fresh threats (vers. 13, 14, and 17) were uttered against them. Verse 8. - Write it before them in a tablet; i.e.\" write the prophecy before them\" (equivalent to \"to be set up before them\") \"on a tablet,\" in the briefest possible form (comp. Isaiah 8:1). And note it in a book; i.e. \"and also make a full notation of it in a book,\" or parchment roll. The \"tablet\" was to be for the admonition of the living generation of men; the \"book\" was for future generations, to be a record of God's omniscience and faithfulness \"forever and ever.\" That it may be for the time to come; rather, for an after-day - not for the immediate present only. For ever and ever. Modern critics observe that the phrase, la'ad 'ad 'olam, never occurs elsewhere, and suggest a change of the pointing, which would give the sense of \"for a testimony forever.\" Whether we accept the change or not, the meaning undoubtedly is that consigning the prophecy to a \"book\" would make an appeal to it possible in perpetuum. The perpetuity of the written Word is assumed as certain.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah30:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThat this is a rebellious people, lying children, children that will not hear the law of the LORD:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 9. - That this is a rebellious people; rather, for this is a rebellious people. The words to be written were those of the preceding prophecy. The reason for their being written is now given (comp. Deuteronomy 31:26, 27). Lying children (comp. Isaiah 59:13). They professed devotion to God; but their acts contradicted their words.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah30:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWhich say to the seers, See not; and to the prophets, Prophesy not unto us right things, speak unto us smooth things, prophesy deceits:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 10. - Which say, etc. Not, of course, directly, in so many words. But indirectly they let it be understood that this was what they wished. Compare the advice given to Micaiah by Ahab's messenger, who, no doubt, correctly interpreted the wishes of the monarch and his nobles (1 Kings 22:13). Seers... prophets. Not two classes of persons, but two names for the same class. The\" parallelism\" of Hebrew poetry leads to the constant employment of synonymous clauses. Right things; i.e. the truth in all its plainness. Smooth things; i.e. soft, pleasant announcements. Deceits; or, illusions (comp. Jeremiah 9:5, \"They will deceive\" or \"mock\" - where we have the same root).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah30:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTGet you out of the way, turn aside out of the path, cause the Holy One of Israel to cease from before us.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 11. - Cause the Holy One of Israel to cease from before us. \"The Holy One of Israel\" was one of Isaiah's most frequent names for the Almighty. He used it especially when rebuking Israel's unholiness (Isaiah 1:4; Isaiah 5:24, etc.). The irreligious Jews were weary of this constant iteration, and wished to hear no more concerning this \"Holy One,\" whose very holiness was a reproach to them.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah30:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWherefore thus saith the Holy One of Israel, Because ye despise this word, and trust in oppression and perverseness, and stay thereon:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 12. - Because ye despise this word; rather, because ye reject this word (see 1 Samuel 8:7; 1 Samuel 15:23, 26; 2 Kings 17:15, etc.). The \"word\" intended is probably the prophecy against trusting in Egypt (vers. 1-7). And trust in oppression; or, extortion. Oppressive measures employed to obtain the rich gifts which had to be sent into Egypt (ver. 6) are probably intended (setup. 2 Kings 15:20). Gratz and Cheyne change the reading from 'oshek to 'ikkesh (\"perverseness\"); but without any necessity. And perverseness; literally, crookedness; i.e. \"tortuous policy\" (Kay). And stay thereon; rather, lean or stay yourselves thereon.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah30:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTTherefore this iniquity shall be to you as a breach ready to fall, swelling out in a high wall, whose breaking cometh suddenly at an instant.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 13. - This iniquity shall be to you as a breach ready to fall. Your sin in rebelling against God, rejecting the warnings of his prophets, and trusting in your own devices shall bring you into the condition of a wall in which there is a \"breach,\" or rather, a \"bulge,\" which therefore totters to its fall, and is liable to dissolve in ruins at any moment. Swelling out in a high wall. The higher the wail, the greater the danger, and the more complete the destruction.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah30:14VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he shall break it as the breaking of the potters' vessel that is broken in pieces; he shall not spare: so that there shall not be found in the bursting of it a sherd to take fire from the hearth, or to take water withal out of the pit.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 14. - And he shall break it as the breaking of the potters' vessel that is broken in pieces. Isaiah is fond of mixed metaphors, and of superseding one metaphor by another. From comparing Judah's fall and ruin to the shattering of a lofty wall, he suddenly turns to a comparison of it with the breaking to pieces of an earthen pitcher. Judah shall be so broken as when the pitcher is crushed into minute fragments, so that there is no piece large enough to convey a coal from one fire for the lighting of another, or to be of even the least use for drawing water from a well. A complete dissolution of the political fabric is foreshadowed, such as did not actually take effect till the conquest of Jerusalem by Nebuchadnezzar.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah30:15VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor thus saith the Lord GOD, the Holy One of Israel; In returning and rest shall ye be saved; in quietness and in confidence shall be your strength: and ye would not.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 15. - For thus saith the Lord God, the Holy One of Israel. As the irreligious party wished to hear no more of \"the Holy One of Israel\" (ver. 11), Isaiah takes care to keep him constantly before their minds (comp. Isaiah 31:1). In returning and rest shall ye be saved; rather, should ye be saved, or might ye be saved. The conditions are put forward, not as now capable of being realized, but as those which might have been realized at an earlier date. The \"returning\" spoken of is an abandonment of the course hitherto pursued, which was reckless provocation of Assyria and trust in Egypt. The \"rest\" is staying upon God - renunciation of trust on any arm of flesh, and simple reliance on the Divine aid, as sure to be sufficient when the need came. In quietness and confidence shall be your strength; rather, should be. The clause is a mere iteration in other words of the preceding one. Ye would not. They had practically rejected the policy of quiescence and patient waiting upon God, when they sent the embassy into Egypt.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah30:16VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut ye said, No; for we will flee upon horses; therefore shall ye flee: and, We will ride upon the swift; therefore shall they that pursue you be swift.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 16. - Ye said, No; for we will flee upon horses; rather, we will fly upon horses. The nobles had perhaps a manly eagerness to mount the Egyptian war-horses, and rush upon the enemy at full speed, in the hope of discomfiting them. Isaiah warns them that they will not really fig on the enemy, but flee before him. We will ride upon the swift. \"The swift\" (kal) seems to be a mere variant for \"horse,\" the parallelism being, as so frequently, \"synonymous.\" Therefore shall they that pursue you be swift. However swift the horses of the Judaeans, their enemies would be as well mounted and would pursue and overtake them.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah30:17VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTOne thousand shall flee at the rebuke of one; at the rebuke of five shall ye flee: till ye be left as a beacon upon the top of a mountain, and as an ensign on an hill.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 17. - One thousand shall flee at the rebuke of one. A hyperbole common in Scripture (Deuteronomy 32:30; Joshua 23:10; Leviticus 26:8), and not confined to the sacred writers. Piankhi the Ethiopian boasts, in his great inscription, that, with Ammon's help, \"many should turn their backs upon a few, and one should rout a thousand\" ('Records of the Past,' vol. it. p. 84). At the rebuke of five. The \"rebuke\" of five (i.e. their war-shout) would put to flight the whole army. As a beacon; rather, as a flag-staff - stripped and bare (comp. Isaiah 33:23; Ezekiel 27:5). A tree stripped of its branches and left standing as a landmark seems to be intended. As an ensign. A military standard, such as was in common use among the Assyrians and Egyptians, as among the Greeks and Romans (see 'Ancient Monarchies,' vol. 2. p. 57; Rawlinson, 'Hist. of Egypt,' vol. 1. p. 463).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah30:18VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd therefore will the LORD wait, that he may be gracious unto you, and therefore will he be exalted, that he may have mercy upon you: for the LORD is a God of judgment: blessed are all they that wait for him.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 18-26. - A RENEWAL OF PROMISE. The denunciations of the preceding passage (vers. 9-17) had been so terrible that, without some counterpoise of promise, they must have produced a general despair. This was not the Divine purpose. Judah's probation still continued. Therefore it was necessary to let it be seen that the Divine long-suffering was not yet exhausted - there were still conditions under which God would be gracious to his people. The conditions were \"crying to the Lord\" (ver. 19), and entire abolition of idolatry (ver. 22). Verse 18. - And therefore. \"Because your sins require this chastisement\" (Kay); \"Because of the extremity of your need\" (Cheyne). It is, perhaps, best to own that the motives of the Divine action are very commonly obscure; and, if seen clearly by the prophets, are certainly not clearly set forth, being (it may be) inscrutable. While the motive, however, is obscure, the promise is plain and unmistakable, The Lord will wait, that he may be gracious unto you. God is not about at present to \"make a full end;\" he is bent on \"waiting\" - his intent is \"to be gracious.\" He will be exalted, that he may have mercy. He will find some means of vindicating his honor and exalting himself, short of your destruction, in order that it may be open to him to give you a further chance of repentance, whereby you would obtain mercy. For the Lord is a God of judgment. God is essentially just; sin must receive punishment; but the punishment may be short of destruction. Justice does not exclude mercy. If men bear their punishment with patience, and wait for God, a brighter day will dawn on them in course of time.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah30:19VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor the people shall dwell in Zion at Jerusalem: thou shalt weep no more: he will be very gracious unto thee at the voice of thy cry; when he shall hear it, he will answer thee.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 19. - For the people shall dwell in Zion; rather, a people shall continue. Jerusalem shall not now be made desolate, or deprived of its inhabitants. Whatever the number of captives taken, \"a people shall remain.\" Thou shalt weep no more. The reasons for weeping shall be removed. He will be very gracious unto thee at the voice of thy cry. For God to be gracious to them, they must first \"cry\" to him - make an earnest, hearty appeal to him for mercy. Their \"cry\" will be answered as soon as heard, is as soon as uttered.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah30:20VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd though the Lord give you the bread of adversity, and the water of affliction, yet shall not thy teachers be removed into a corner any more, but thine eyes shall see thy teachers:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 20. - And though the Lord give you the bread of adversity (so Mr. Cheyne). But most modern critics (Kay, Delitzsch, Vance Smith, etc.) regard the words as a promise of support through the siege, and omit the interpolated \"though.\" Translate, And the Lord will give yon bread of adversity, and water of affliction; i.e. scant rations, but sufficient; and thy teachers shall not, etc. Be removed into a corner; i.e. \"have to hide themselves from persecution.\" A persecution of Jehovah's prophets had commenced in Judah during the reign of Joash (2 Chronicles 24:19-22), and had probably continued with more or less severity ever since.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah30:21VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd thine ears shall hear a word behind thee, saying, This is the way, walk ye in it, when ye turn to the right hand, and when ye turn to the left.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 21. - Thine ears shall hear a word behind thee. Kay says, \"The teacher will go before his flock, marking out the way before them.\" But in that case, the flock would hear the word before them. Delitzsch explains better, \"They (the teachers), as the shepherds of the flock, would follow the people with friendly words of admonition.\" Even in the East, shepherds sometimes follow their flocks (see Genesis 32:17). When ye turn, i.e. when ye are about to turn.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah30:22VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTYe shall defile also the covering of thy graven images of silver, and the ornament of thy molten images of gold: thou shalt cast them away as a menstruous cloth; thou shalt say unto it, Get thee hence.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 22. - Ye shall defile also the covering of thy graven images of silver. Idolatry, greatly encouraged by Ahaz, had been strictly forbidden by Hezekiah at the beginning of his reign (2 Kings 18:4); but the present passage, among others, shows how impossible it was for a king, with the best intentions, to effect the extirpation of idolatry, if his subjects were attached to it. Evidently the Jews had, in many cases, secretly maintained their idols and their idolatrous practices, despite the efforts of Hezekiah. But now, in their repentance, they would \"defile\" (i.e. destroy) both the outer \"covering\" of precious rectal, and the inner core of wood or stone, or base metallic substance. The ornament of thy molten images of gold; rather, the coating or overlaying. It was usual to overlay with gold or silver molten images of bronze or other inferior metal. Cast them away; literally, scatter; i.e. either grind them to powder (2 Kings 23:6), or at any rate break them to bits, and then disperse the fragments far and wide.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah30:23VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen shall he give the rain of thy seed, that thou shalt sow the ground withal; and bread of the increase of the earth, and it shall be fat and plenteous: in that day shall thy cattle feed in large pastures.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 23. - Then shall he give the rain of thy seed, that thou shalt sow the ground withal; rather, then shall he give rain for thy seed, wherewith thou sowest the ground. God, having forgiven his people, will once more renew the blessings of his ordinary providence, giving them \"rain from heaven, and fruitful seasons, filling their hearts with food and gladness\" (Acts 14:17). Bread of the increase of the earth; rather, bread, the produce of the ground; i.e. ordinary bread, not \"bread from heaven,\" like the manna in the wilderness. Fat and plenteous; literally, rich and fat. Thy cattle. To complete the general prosperity, there should be plentiful pasture for the flocks and herds.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah30:24VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe oxen likewise and the young asses that ear the ground shall eat clean provender, which hath been winnowed with the shovel and with the fan.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 24. - The oxen likewise and the young asses that ear the ground; rather, theft till or cultivate the ground. The Hebrew word is generic, and does not apply to \"eating\" (i.e. ploughing) only. Shall eat clean provender. Delitzsch says that b'lil khamitz is \"a mash, composed of oats, barley, and vetches, made more savory with salt and sour vegetables.\" Mr. Cheyne translates, \"Shall eat mixed provender with salt.\" The general idea is clearly that they shall have for their ordinary food that superior kind of provender which, according to existing practices, was reserved for rare occasions. Winnowed with the shovel. Anciently, winnowing was chiefly effected by tossing the grain into the air with shovels in a draughty place (see Wilkinson,' Ancient Egyptians,' vol. 4. pp. 86, 89, 90). The fan was scarcely in use so early as Isaiah's time. He means by mizreh probably a second instrument for tossing the grain Delitzsch translates, \"winnowing-fork.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah30:25VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd there shall be upon every high mountain, and upon every high hill, rivers and streams of waters in the day of the great slaughter, when the towers fall.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 25. - Rivers and streams of water; rather, rivulets, courses of water. Channels, along which water was conveyed for the purpose of irrigation, are intended (comp. Ezekiel 47:1-12; Joel 3:18). No doubt there is a secondary allegorical meaning running through the whole description of Judah's prosperity (vers. 23-26). In this allegorical intention the waters stand for the streams of God's grace. In the day of the great slaughter. Equivalent to \"the day of vengeance\" (Isaiah 34:8) the day when God shall tread down his enemies. The prophet passes from the immediate effect of Judah's repentance to a broader view of what shall happen when God's kingdom is established upon the earth. When the towers fall; i.e. when there shall be a general \"pulling down of strong holds,\" and a \"casting down of every high thing that exalts itself against God\" (2 Corinthians 10:4, 5).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah30:26VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTMoreover the light of the moon shall be as the light of the sun, and the light of the sun shall be sevenfold, as the light of seven days, in the day that the LORD bindeth up the breach of his people, and healeth the stroke of their wound.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 26. - The light of the moon shall be as the light of the sun. \"The promise now rises higher and higher, and passes from earth to heaven\" (Delitzsch). All nature will become more glorious in the \"last times.\" Moonlight will be as sunlight, and sunlight will be seven times brighter than it is now. Again, there may be an under allegorical sense. The light of truth will shine with greater brilliancy, so that all inch will be enlightened by it. \"For the earth shall be full of the knowledge of God, as the waters cover the sea\" (Isaiah 11:9). As the light of seven days; i.e. as though the light of seven days were concentrated into one. In the day that the Lord bindeth up the breach. At that period in the world's history when God forgives the iniquities of his people, and condescends to reign over them as their actual King, either in this present world or in \"anew heaven and anew earth\" (Revelation 21:1; comp. Isaiah 66:22), wherein shall \"dwell righteousness\" (2 Peter 3:13). And healeth the stroke of their wound; rather, the wound of his stroke; i.e. the wound caused by the stroke wherewith he has smitten them.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah30:27VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBehold, the name of the LORD cometh from far, burning with his anger, and the burden thereof is heavy: his lips are full of indignation, and his tongue as a devouring fire:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 27-33. - A PROPHECY OF ASSYRIA'S DESTRUCTION. Mr. Chcyne regards this passage as \"a symbolic description of the judgment introduced by a theophany.\" But is it not rather a poetical description of God's judgment on Assyria, which may be, probably is, a type of his final judgment upon an iniquitous world? The mention of Assyria in ver. 31 seems to be decisive in favor of the prophecy being (primarily) of special application to the circumstances of the time. Verse 27. - The Name of the Lord cometh from far. \"The Name of Jehovah\" is scarcely distinguishable from Jehovah himself. Jehovah, who has long hid himself, and seemed to keep himself remote from worldly affairs, now is about to manifest his glory, and interpose in the doings of men in a wonderful way. Burning with his anger; rather, his anger burneth (comp. Isaiah 42:25). And the burden thereof is heavy; \"anti heavy is its grievousness.\" His tongue as a devouring fire (comp. Exodus 24:17; Deuteronomy 9:3; Isaiah 9:19; Isaiah 10:17; Isaiah 29:6; Isaiah 33:14).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah30:28VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd his breath, as an overflowing stream, shall reach to the midst of the neck, to sift the nations with the sieve of vanity: and there shall be a bridle in the jaws of the people, causing them to err.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 28. - His breath, as an overflowing stream, shall reach to the midst of the neck. When the sacred writers are oppressed by the tremendous character of the revelations made to them, their metaphors are often labored and incongruous. Here, the mouth, in which there is a tongue of fire, sends forth a rush of breath, which is compared to an \"overflowing stream, which reaches to the middle of the neck, \"and sweeps those who try to cross it away (comp. Ezekiel 47:5) To sift the nations with the sieve of vanity. More incongruity, to be excused by the writer's theme being such as to transcend all language and all imagery. One of the Divine purposes, in all violent crashes and revolutions, is \"to sift nations\" - to separate in each nation the good from the bad, the precious from the vile; and this is done with \"the sieve of vanity,\" i.e. the sieve which allows the good corn to pass through, separating from it, and keeping back, all that is vile and refuse (comp. Amos 9:9). There shall be a bridle in the jaws of the people, causing them to err. Another entire change in the metaphor. The result of God's interference shall be \"to put a bridle in the jaws of the peoples,\" whereby the hand of the Almighty will guide them to their destruction.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah30:29VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTYe shall have a song, as in the night when a holy solemnity is kept; and gladness of heart, as when one goeth with a pipe to come into the mountain of the LORD, to the mighty One of Israel.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 29. - Ye shall have a song; literally, to you will [then] be a song. While the nations weep and lament, and are burnt up by God's anger, and swept away by his \"overflowing flood,\" and guided to their destruction by his bridle in their jaws, Israel shall rejoice with singing. As in the night when a holy solemnity is kept. Perhaps a special reference is intended to the Pass-over-feast, which commenced with an even-tag or night celebration (Exodus 12:6, 8, 42; Matthew 26:30). Or perhaps \"Isaiah is not referring to one feast more than another\" (Cheyne), night-rituals belonging to all toasts, since the day commenced with the sunset. The Passover-song consisted of Psalm 113. - 118. And as when one goeth with a pipe to come into the mountain of the Lord. Joyful processions from the country districts to Jerusalem are alluded to. These were commonly headed by a piper or a band of pipers (Vitringa). They took place several times in the year - at each of the three great feasts, and irregularly when any district sent up its firstfruits to the temple treasury (Nehemiah 10:35-37). To the Mighty One of Israel; literally, to the Rock of Israel; i.e. to Jehovah (comp. Isaiah 17:10; and see also Deuteronomy 32:4, 15, 18, 30, 31; Psalm 18:2, 31, 46, etc.). The idea embodied in the metaphor is rather that of an unfailing refuge than of mere might and power.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah30:30VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the LORD shall cause his glorious voice to be heard, and shall shew the lighting down of his arm, with the indignation of his anger, and with the flame of a devouring fire, with scattering, and tempest, and hailstones.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 30. - The Lord shall cause his glorious voice to be heard; literally, the majesty of his voice, Mr. Cheyne renders, \"the peal of his voice.\" Delitzsch understands fearful thundering, like that at Sinai (Exodus 19:16; Exodus 20:18), to be intended (comp. Psalm 29:3-9). The lighting down of his arm; i.e. the blow causing the destruction, of ver. 31, of whatever kind that destruction might be - blasting by lightning, plague, simoom, death by the visitation of God, as men slept, or any other sudden, sweeping catastrophe. With the indignation of his anger; rather, in fury of anger. With the flame of a devouring fire; rather, with a flame of devouring-fire. All the elements of storm are accumulated by the prophet, to express the terrible character of the coming judgment-lightning, and scattering (of crops?), tempestuous wind, and hail-stones.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah30:31VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor through the voice of the LORD shall the Assyrian be beaten down, which smote with a rod.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 31. - For through the voice of the Lord shall the Assyrian be beaten down; rather, for at the voice of the Lord shall Assyria be dismayed (compare the first clause of ver. 30). Which smote with a rod; rather, with the rod will he (i.e. Jehovah) smite.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah30:32VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd in every place where the grounded staff shall pass, which the LORD shall lay upon him, it shall be with tabrets and harps: and in battles of shaking will he fight with it.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 32. - In every place where the grounded staff shall pass, etc.; rather, and it shall come to pass that every stroke (literally, passage) of the destined rod which Jehovah causes to rest upon him shall be with an accompaniment of drums and citherns. Each blow dealt to Assyria shall rejoice her enemies, and cause them to break out into songs of praise, accompanied by the music of various instruments (comp. ver. 29; and see also Exodus 15:1-21). In battles of shaking; or, battles of swinging - \"those in which Jehovah swings his rod, and deals (repeated) blows to his enemies\" (Cheyne). Will he fight with it; rather, will he fight against her; i.e. against Assyria.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah30:33VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor Tophet is ordained of old; yea, for the king it is prepared; he hath made it deep and large: the pile thereof is fire and much wood; the breath of the LORD, like a stream of brimstone, doth kindle it.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 33. - For Tophet is ordained of old; rather, for a Tophet has been long since prepared. A \"Tophet\" is a place of burning, probably derived from the Aryan root tap or taph, found in Greek τάφος τέφρα, Latin tep-idus, Sanskrit tap, Persian taphtan. The name was specially attached to a particular spot in the Valley of Hinnom, where sacrifices were offered to Moloch (2 Kings 23:10; Jeremiah 7:31; Jeremiah 19:6, 11, etc.); but Isaiah seems to use it generically, as if there were many Tophets. For the king it is prepared; literally, it also is prepared for the king - in the Hebrew \"for the moloch,\" which is the same word as \"Moloch,\" who was looked upon by his worshippers as \"the king\" ςκατς ἐξοχήν. Isaiah means to say, \"As the Tophet of the Vale of Hinnom is prepared for a king (Moloch), so this new Tophet is prepared for another king (the King of Assyria).\" He hath made it deep and large - a vast burning-place for a vast multitude (2 Kings 19:35), with the fire and the wood ready, only awaiting the breath of Jehovah to kindle it. As the bodies of great malefactors were burnt (Joshua 7:25), and not buried, so the prophet consigns to a great burning the hundred and eighty-five thousand Assyrian corpses, of which it would soon be necessary to dispose in some way.NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINE","Isa.31":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah31:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWoe to them that go down to Egypt for help; and stay on horses, and trust in chariots, because they are many; and in horsemen, because they are very strong; but they look not unto the Holy One of Israel, neither seek the LORD!VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 1-3. - A FURTHER WARNING AGAINST SEEKING THE ALLIANCE OF EGYPT. This prophecy seems to be quite independent of the last (Isaiah 30:1-7). It may have been given earlier or later. The chief point brought out, which had not distinctly appeared previously, is the value set on the horses and chariots of Egypt in the conflict with Assyria (comp. 2 Kings 18:24). Verse 1. - Woe to them that go down to Egypt for help (comp. Isaiah 30:1, 2; and see also the earlier prophecy, Isaiah 20:2-6). The examples of Samaria, Gaza, and Ashdod might well have taught the lesson of distrust of Egypt, without any Divine warnings (see G. Smith's 'Eponym Canon,' pp. 125-131). But the Jews were infatuated, and relied on Egypt despite her previous failures to give effective aid. And stay on horses. The Assyrian cavalry was very numerous, and very efficient. It is often represented on the monuments. Egyptian cavalry, on the other hand, is not represented at all; and it may be questioned whether, in the early times, the Egyptian war-horses were not entirely employed in the chariot-service (see 'Pulpit Commentary' on Exodus, p. 321). The later dynasties of Egyptian kings, however, employed cavalry, as appears from 2 Chronicles 12:3; Herod., 2:162; 'Records of the Past,' vol. it. pp. 68, 70, 72, etc. And trust in chariots, because they are many. The large number of the chariots maintained by the Pharaohs is abundantly evidenced. Diodorus assigns to Sesostris twenty-seven thousand (1. 54, § 4). This is, no doubt, an exaggeration; but the six hundred of the Pharaoh of the Exodus (Exodus 14:7), and even the one thousand two hundred of Shishak(2 Chronicles 12:3) are moderate computations, quite in accord with the monuments, and with all that we otherwise know of Egyptian warfare. Egypt exported chariots to the neighboring countries (1 Kings 10:29), and was at this time the only power which seemed capable of furnishing such a chariot-force as could hope to contend on tolerably even terms with the force of Assyria. They look not unto the Holy One of Israel (comp. Isaiah 30:11, 12). The trust in the Egyptian alliance was accompanied by a distrust of Jehovah and his power, and a disinclination to look to him for aid.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah31:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTYet he also is wise, and will bring evil, and will not call back his words: but will arise against the house of the evildoers, and against the help of them that work iniquity.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 2. - Yet he also is wise. Intense irony. \"Wisdom is not wholly confined to the human counselors whose advice Judah follows (Isaiah 29:14). He (Jehovah) is 'wise' too, and could give prudent counsel if his advice were asked.\" As he is not consulted, he will bring evil upon his people, and will not call back, or retract, his words of threatening, but will give them accomplishment, by rising up against the house of the evil-doers (i.e. the Jews), and their help (i.e. the Egyptians).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah31:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTNow the Egyptians are men, and not God; and their horses flesh, and not spirit. When the LORD shall stretch out his hand, both he that helpeth shall fall, and he that is holpen shall fall down, and they all shall fail together.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 3. - Now the Egyptians are men, and not God. Judah relied on Pharaoh, as on a sort of God, which indeed he was considered in his own country ('Records of the Past,' vol. 6. p. 145, I. 320; p. 148, 1.418, etc.). Isaiah asserts the contrary in the strongest way: the Egyptians, one and all, are men - mere men; and \"there is no help in them\" (Psalm 146:3). Their horses flesh, and not spirit. The horses, on which so much reliance was placed, were mere animals, subject to all the weakness of the animal nature, not spirit-horses, with a life and vigor of their own, by which they could be a real tower of strength to those on whose side they ranged themselves. They all shall fail together; i.e. the helpers and the helped (compare the concluding clauses of ver. 2).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah31:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor thus hath the LORD spoken unto me, Like as the lion and the young lion roaring on his prey, when a multitude of shepherds is called forth against him, he will not be afraid of their voice, nor abase himself for the noise of them: so shall the LORD of hosts come down to fight for mount Zion, and for the hill thereof.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 4-9. - A PROMISE OF PROTECTION, AND OF THE DISCOMFITURE OF ASSYRIA. In the promise of protection (vers. 4, 5) there is nothing new but the imagery, which is of remarkable beauty. The promise is followed by a brief exhortation (vers. 6, 7); and then the discomfiture of Assyria is declared in the plainest terms, and her flight before the avenging sword of God (vers. 8, 9). Verse 4. - Like as the lion, etc. The resemblance of this simile to Hem., 'Iliad,' 18:11. 161, 162, has been often noticed. In both, the lion has seized his prey, and is crouching over it; the shepherds gather themselves together against him, and seek to scare him away; but he remains firm, undaunted by their threats and cries, never for a moment relinquishing the body of which he has made himself the master. The image is best explained as representing Jehovah, standing over and keeping guard on Jerusalem, which he will allow, no one to rend from him. And the young lion; rather, even the young lion (Lowth). A single animal must be intended. Roaring on his prey; rather, growleth over his prey. So shall the Lord of hosts come down to fight for Mount Zion; rather, so shall the Lord of hosts descend, to fight, on Mount Zion. If we connect the concluding words of the clause with tsaba, to fight, the meaning must be \"fight against,\" as Delitzsch shows conclusively. But we may connect them with the more distant yered, will descend, in which case they will mean \"on,\" or \"upon Mount Zion\" (comp. Exodus 19:18; Psalm 133:3). The best commentators are of opinion that this must be the sense. The words are a promise, not a threat.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah31:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAs birds flying, so will the LORD of hosts defend Jerusalem; defending also he will deliver it; and passing over he will preserve it.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 5. - As birds flying; rather, as birds hovering, or fluttering, ever their young, to protect them. A second simile, expressive of tenderness, as the former one was of power and strength. Defending, also, etc. Translate, defending and delivering, passing over and preserving. In the word \"passing over\" there seems to be a reference to the institution of the Passover, when the angel, sometimes identified with Jehovah himself, \"passed ever\" and spared the Israelites.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah31:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTTurn ye unto him from whom the children of Israel have deeply revolted.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 6. - Turn ye unto him. Then, at any rate, if not before, turn to him who will have delivered you from so great a peril. \"Turn to him, O children of Israel, from whom men have so deeply revolted.\" The third person is used instead of the second, out of tenderness, not to hurt their feelings by mingling with promise an open rebuke.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah31:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor in that day every man shall cast away his idols of silver, and his idols of gold, which your own hands have made unto you for a sin.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 7. - For in that day every man shall cast away his idols. \"In that day\" - the day of Assyria's discomfiture - shall the vanity of idols be seen and recognized. They have not helped Assyria. How should they help Judah (comp. Isaiah 30:22)?NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah31:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen shall the Assyrian fall with the sword, not of a mighty man; and the sword, not of a mean man, shall devour him: but he shall flee from the sword, and his young men shall be discomfited.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 8. - Then shall the Assyrian fall with the sword, not of a mighty man; rather, and Assyria shall fall by the sword of one who is not a man Assyria's destruction will not be by the visible swords of human enemies, but by the invisible sword of God (comp. 2 Kings 19:35). And the sword, not of a mean man, shall devour him; rather, and the sword of one who is not a mortal shall detour him - an instance of \"synonymous parallelism.\" He shall flee; more literally, betake himself to flight. His young men shall be discomfited; rather, as in the margin, shall be for tribute. They shall become the vassals of a foreign power.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah31:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he shall pass over to his strong hold for fear, and his princes shall be afraid of the ensign, saith the LORD, whose fire is in Zion, and his furnace in Jerusalem.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 9. - And he shall pass over to his strong hold for fear; rather, and his Rock shall pass away for fear (marginal rendering). It is generally agreed by recent commentators (Kay, Delitzsch, Cheyne), that the rock intended, which is contrasted with the \"princes\" of the next clause, is Assyria's king (see the contrast of the king, who is \"a great rock,\" and his princes, in Isaiah 32:1, 2). (On the hurried flight of Sennacherib to Nineveh, see below, Isaiah 37:37.) His princes shall be afraid of the ensign. The word nes, ensign, seems to be here used collectively. The Assyrian princes would tremble at every signal that they saw displayed along their line of route, expecting some enemy to fall upon them. His furnace. Jehovah was at once a Light to his people, and \"a consuming Fire\" (Hebrews 12:29) to his enemies. His presence, indicated by the Shechinah in the holy of holies, was at once for blessing and for burning.NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINE","Isa.32":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah32:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBehold, a king shall reign in righteousness, and princes shall rule in judgment.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 1-8. - A PROPHECY OF MESSIAH'S KINGDOM. It is generally allowed that this prophecy is Messianic; but some critics insist that it is not so \"in a narrow sense.\" They regard Isaiah as expecting Messiah's kingdom to follow immediately on the discomfiture of Sennacherib, and as looking to Hezekiah to inaugurate it. According to this view, Hezekiah, renovated in character, was to be the Messiah, and might have been so had he been \"equal to the demands providentially made upon him.\" But he was not; and the task of establishing the kingdom fell to \"another,\" at a later date. It is simpler to regard the prophet as looking for a greater than Hezekiah (comp. Isaiah 7:14; Isaiah 9:6), but ignorant how soon, or how late, his coming would be. Verse 1. - A king... princes. Delitzsch and Mr. Cheyne translate, \"the king... the princes;\" but the Hebrew gives no article. The announcement is vague, and corresponds to those of other prophets, as of Jeremiah (Jeremiah 23:5), \"Behold, the days come that I will raise unto David a righteous Branch, and a king shall reign and prosper;\" and of Zechariah (Zechariah 9:9), \"Rejoice greatly, O daughter of Zion... behold, thy King cometh unto thee.\" The \"princes\" of the text are the minor authorities whom the king would set over his kingdom - i.e., the apostles and their successors. In righteousness... in judgment. Messiah's rule will be a rule of strict justice and right, offering the strongest contrast to that under which the Jews have been living since the time of Jehoshaphat (see Isaiah 1:15-23; Isaiah 3:1-12, etc.).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah32:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd a man shall be as an hiding place from the wind, and a covert from the tempest; as rivers of water in a dry place, as the shadow of a great rock in a weary land.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 2. - A man shall be as an hiding-place from the wind, etc. Modern critics mostly render, \"each man\" - i.e. the king, and each of his princes. But it is, to say the least, allowable - with Vitringa and Kay - to regard the word as referring to the king only (comp. Zechariah 6:12, where ish, a man, is used in the same vague way of One who is clearly the Messiah). There was never but one man who could be to other men all that is predicated in this verse of the \"man\" mentioned (comp. Isaiah 25:4, where nearly the same epithets are predicated of God). A covert; i.e. a protection against Divine wrath. Such is Messiah in his mediatorial character. Rivers of water; i.e. refreshing and invigorating (comp. Isaiah 55:1; John 4:14; John 7:37). The shadow of a great rook. At once refreshing and protecting (see Isaiah 25:4).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah32:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the eyes of them that see shall not be dim, and the ears of them that hear shall hearken.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 3. - The eyes of them that see shall not be dim. In Messiah's kingdom there shall be no judicial blindness, such as that threatened in Isaiah 6:9, 10, and described in Isaiah 29:10, 11; but men shall see the truth clearly (comp. Isaiah 29:18; Isaiah 35:5; Matthew 13:16, etc.). The ears.., shall hearken; i.e. \"shall both hear and understated\" (compare \"He that hath ears to hear, let him hear\").NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah32:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe heart also of the rash shall understand knowledge, and the tongue of the stammerers shall be ready to speak plainly.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 4. - The heart also of the rash; i.e. of those who were rash and hasty, who would not give themselves time to understand the warnings addressed to them, or to think of the real character of their actions. These shall, in Messiah's kingdom, \"have the gift of discernment to perceive things in their true nature\" (Delitzsch). The tongue of the stammerers. The tongue of those who hitherto have spoken hesitatingly and inconsistently on moral and religions subjects shall be ready - i.e., prompt and eager - to speak upon them with clearness and elegance. The grace given to the uneducated fishermen of Galilee enabled them to preach and teach gospel truth, not only with clearness, but with refinement.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah32:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe vile person shall be no more called liberal, nor the churl said to be bountiful.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 5. - The vile person shall be no more called liberal; rather, the foolish person - as nabal is commonly translated (Deuteronomy 32:6; 2 Samuel 3:33; 2 Samuel 13:13; Psalm 14:1; Psalm 39:8; Psalm 74:22, etc.) - such a man as the \"Nabal\" of 1 Samuel 25. Men are apt to confound moral distinctions, and to call the \"fools\" who waste their substance in feasting and revelry \"generous\" or \"liberal,\" and the niggards (churls) who hoard their riches \"warm men,\" \"wealthy men,\" \"men well to do in the world\" (see Isaiah 5:20; and comp. Arist.,' Eth. Nic.,' 2:8, § 3; Thucyd., 3:82). This perversion of truth shall not obtain in Messiah's kingdom. Bountiful; rather, wealthy (comp. Job 34:19, where the same word is translated \"rich\").NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah32:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor the vile person will speak villany, and his heart will work iniquity, to practise hypocrisy, and to utter error against the LORD, to make empty the soul of the hungry, and he will cause the drink of the thirsty to fail.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 6. - For the vile person will speak villany, etc.; rather, for the fool speaketh folly, and his heart doeth wickedness, practising profanity and uttering error against Jehocab, making empty the soul of the hungry - yea, the drink of the thirsty will he cause to fail. The prophet seems to have the portrait of Nabal in his mind, and to take him as the type of a class.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah32:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe instruments also of the churl are evil: he deviseth wicked devices to destroy the poor with lying words, even when the needy speaketh right.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 7. - The instruments. Mr. Cheyne translates, \"the machinations,\" which gives a better sense; but the rendering is scarcely borne out by any parallel use of the term c'li in Scripture or elsewhere. C'li properly means \"vessels,\" \"weapons,\" \"implements.\" He deviseth wicked devices; rather, he deviseth plots. The word \"he\" is emphatic. Unlike the fool, who passively does evil through thoughtlessness, the niggard actively devises crafty plans against his fellow-men. He seeks to cheat the poor out of their rights by false witness (comp. Isaiah 1:17, 23; Isaiah 3:14, 15; Isaiah 5:28, etc.), Even when the needy speaketh right; i.e. \"has right on his side.\" The translation in the text is to be preferred to that in the margin.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah32:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut the liberal deviseth liberal things; and by liberal things shall he stand.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 8. - By liberal things shall he stand; or, to liberal things.

FURTHER DENUNCIATIONS OF ISRAEL, JOINED WITH PROMISES (Isaiah 32:9-20).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah32:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTRise up, ye women that are at ease; hear my voice, ye careless daughters; give ear unto my speech.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 9-12. - A REBUKE OF THE WOMEN. It might seem at first sight as if we had here a detached utterance of the prophet, accidentally conjoined with the preceding passage (vers. 1-8). But vers. 15-18 furnish a link of connection between the two portions of the chapter, and make it probable that they were delivered at the same time. Mr. Cheyne supposes that the indifference of a knot of women, gathered at some little distance from the men to whom Isaiah had addressed vers. 1-8, provoked the prophet suddenly to turn to them, and speak to them in terms of warning. Verse 9. - Rise up. The \"careless daughters\" are sitting, or reclining upon couches, at their ease. The prophet bids them stand up, to hear a message from God (comp. Judges 3:10). Ye women that are at ease; i.e. \"that are self-satisfied and self-complacent.\" The word employed has almost always a bad sense (see 2 Kings 19:28; Job 12:5; Psalm 123:4; Amos 6:1; Zechariah 1:15). Hear my voice. This clause should be attached to the first half of the verse. The order of the words in the original is, \"Ye women that are at ease, rise up and hear my words; ye careless daughters, hearken unto my speech.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah32:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTMany days and years shall ye be troubled, ye careless women: for the vintage shall fail, the gathering shall not come.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 10. - Many days and years shall ye be troubled; rather, in a year and days; i.e. \"in less than two years.\" The object of the prophet is not to fix the duration of the trouble, but to mark the time of its commencement (comp. Isaiah 29:1). Shall ye be troubled; rather, shall ye tremble, or shudder (so Deuteronomy 2:25; Psalm 77:18; Psalm 99:1; Isaiah 5:25; Isaiah 64:2; Jeremiah 33:9, etc.). Ye careless women; rather, ye confident ones. The word is different from that employed in vers. 9 and 11. The vintage shall fail; literally, has failed - \"the perfect of prophetic certitude\" (Cheyne). Some critics understand a literal failure, or destruction, of the vintage through the invasion of the Assyrians. Others suggest a refer-once to Isaiah 5:4-7. The vineyard of the Lord (Judah) has utterly failed to bring forth grapes - there is no ingathering - therefore destruction shall fall upon it.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah32:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTTremble, ye women that are at ease; be troubled, ye careless ones: strip you, and make you bare, and gird sackcloth upon your loins.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 11. - Tremble... be troubled. The repetition of this verse is, as usual, emphatic. Its object is to impress those whom the prophet is addressing with the certainty of the coming judgment. Strip you, and make you bare; i.e. \"bare your breasts,\" in preparation for the beating which is to follow (see the comment on the next verse).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah32:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThey shall lament for the teats, for the pleasant fields, for the fruitful vine.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 12. - They shall lament for the teats, etc.; rather, they shall beat upon the breasts for the pleasant fields, etc. (so the LXX., the Vulgate, Jarchi, Gesenius, Ewald, Maurer, Knobel, Delitzsch, and Mr. Cheyne). Dr. Kay prefers the rendering of the Authorized Version, understanding by \"the teats\" such \"dry breasts\" as Hosea speaks of (Hosea 9:14). But nothing has been said in this place of any such affliction. For the pleasant fields, etc.; i.e. for their loss (see ver. 10).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah32:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTUpon the land of my people shall come up thorns and briers; yea, upon all the houses of joy in the joyous city:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 13-20. - A FURTHER MINGLING OF THREATS WITH COMFORTING PROMISES. The women require, like the men, to be both warned and comforted, wherefore the prophet addresses to them, as to the men in Isaiah 30. and 31, an intermixture of threatening (vers. 13, 14) with promise (vers. 15-20). Verse 13. - Upon the land of my people shall come up thorns and briars. This was the punishment with which the unfruitful vineyard was threatened in Isaiah 5:6. It may be understood either literally or of the wickedness that would abound when the time of judgment came. Yea, upon all the houses of joy (comp. Isaiah 5:9). If Sennacherib carried off, as he declares (G. Smith, 'Epenym Canon,' p. 134), more than two hundred thousand captives from Judaea, he must have left many houses without inhabitants. The solitude begun by him was completed by the Babylonians. The joyous city (see Isaiah 22:2). The word used has generally the sense of unholy mirth (comp. Isaiah 23:7; Isaiah 24:8; Zephaniah 2:15; Zephaniah 3:11).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah32:14VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBecause the palaces shall be forsaken; the multitude of the city shall be left; the forts and towers shall be for dens for ever, a joy of wild asses, a pasture of flocks;VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 14. - The palaces shall be forsaken; literally, the palace; but the word is used in a generic sense. The prophet sees in vision Jerusalem deserted by her inhabitants, the grand houses of the rich empty, the strongholds haunted by wild beasts, and the slopes of the hills fed on by sheep, and even occasionally visited by the timid and solitude-loving wild ass. The description suits well the time of the Babylonian captivity, but not any earlier period. Probably it was not revealed to the prophet how soon the condition would be reached. The multitude of the city shall be left. The real meaning is, as Bishop Lowth expresses it, \"The populous city shall be left desolate.\" But the whole passage is. as Delitzsch observes, \"grammatically strange, the language becoming more complicated, disjointed, and difficult, the greater the wrath and indignation of the poet.\" The forts and towers; rather, hill and tower, with (perhaps) a special reference to the part of Jerusalem called Ophel (2 Chronicles 27:3; Nehemiah 3:26, etc.), the long projecting spur from the eastern hill, which points a little west of south, and separates the Kedron valley from the Tyropoeon. Shall be for dens; literally, for caves; but dens for wild beasts seem to be meant (comp. Isaiah 13:21; Isaiah 34:14; Jeremiah 50:39). For ever. This expression must not be pressed. Hyperbole is a recognized feature of poetry written under strong excitement. A joy of wild asses. The wild ass is not now found nearer Palestine than Mesopotamia, or perhaps Northern Syria. It is exceedingly shy, and never approaches the habitations of men.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah32:15VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTUntil the spirit be poured upon us from on high, and the wilderness be a fruitful field, and the fruitful field be counted for a forest.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 15. - Until. The expression \"until\" modifies the previous \"forever,\" showing that the desolation was not always to continue. The Spirit be poured upon us from on high. An effluence from the Holy Spirit of God on individuals of eminence, prophets, kings, artificers, to fit them for their tasks, is recognized in many of the earlier books of Scripture, and especially in the Davidical psalms. But a general effluence of the Spirit of holiness on a nation, to produce a change of heart, seems to be first announced by Isaiah. The nearly contemporary prophecy of Joel (Joel 2:28, 29) is, perhaps, as wide in its scope, but limited to the prophetic gift, which is not necessarily conjoined with spiritual-minded-ness or holiness of life. Isaiah, the \"evangelical prophet,\" first teaches that the conversion of a nation is God's work, effected by the Holy Spirit, and effectual to the entire change of the heart of a people. And the wilderness be a fruitful field; i.e. \"the community long cursed with barrenness of good works\" (ver. 10) \"becomes once more fruitful of them.\" And the fruitful field be counted for a forest. An order of climax seems to be here intended. The midbar, the bare pasturage-ground, becomes a Carmel, i.e. carefully cultivated; the Carmel becomes like Lebanon, a rich and luxurious forest. There is no close parallel between this verse and ver. 17 of Isaiah 29. The prophet is not tied down by his previous metaphors.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah32:16VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen judgment shall dwell in the wilderness, and righteousness remain in the fruitful field.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 16. - Then judgment shall dwell in the wilderness. In all parts of the kingdom of Christ, the lowest as well as the highest, \"judgment\" and \"righteousness\" shall prevail (comp. ver. 1).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah32:17VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the work of righteousness shall be peace; and the effect of righteousness quietness and assurance for ever.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 17. - The work of righteousness shall be peace. Peace - a true peace, not a false one (Jeremiah 6:14) - shall be the result of the reign of righteousness. War, quarrels, enmity, hostile feelings, are all of them the fruit of unrighteousness. In the kingdom of the Messiah, just so far forth as it is thoroughly established, \"the fruit of righteousness is sown in peace of them that make peace\" (James 3:18). The effect of righteousness; literally, the service of righteousness, which perhaps means here \"the wages of righteousness.\" Quietness and assurance; or, quietness and confidence (comp. Isaiah 30:15). The final happiness of the blessed in Christ's kingdom is always spoken of as a state of \"rest and quietness\" (see Psalm 95:11; Job 3:17; Jeremiah 6:16; Matthew 11:28; Hebrews 4:9-11, etc.). The \"confidence\" felt would be an assured confidence, not a rash and foolish one, like that of the women of vers. 10, 11.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah32:18VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd my people shall dwell in a peaceable habitation, and in sure dwellings, and in quiet resting places;VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah32:19VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWhen it shall hail, coming down on the forest; and the city shall be low in a low place.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 19. - When it shall hail, coming down on the forest; rather, but it shall hail in the coming down (i.e. the destruction) of the forest. \"The forest\" has commonly been regarded as Assyria, on the strength of Isaiah 10:18, 19, 33, 34. Mr. Cheyne, however, suggests Judah, or the high and haughty ones of Judah, whose destruction was a necessary preliminary to the establishment of Christ's kingdom. May not God's enemies generally be meant? The city. Nineveh (Lowth, Gesenius, Rosenmüller); Jerusalem (Delitzsch, Knobel, Cheyne, Kay); \"the city in which the hostility of the world to Jehovah will, in the latter days, be centralized\" (Drechsler, Nagel) - the \"world-power,\" in fact. The last view seems to give the best sense.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah32:20VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBlessed are ye that sow beside all waters, that send forth thither the feet of the ox and the ass.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 20. - Blessed are ye that sow beside all waters. The idyllic picture, begun in ver. 15, terminates here. The people of the kingdom have a well-watered land (Isaiah 30:25), where they live peacefully, sowing their seed beside the water-courses, and having abundant pasture for their peaceful beasts - the ox and the ass (comp. Isaiah 30:24). A spiritual meaning doubtless underlies the literal sense.NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINE","Isa.33":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah33:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWoe to thee that spoilest, and thou wast not spoiled; and dealest treacherously, and they dealt not treacherously with thee! when thou shalt cease to spoil, thou shalt be spoiled; and when thou shalt make an end to deal treacherously, they shall deal treacherously with thee.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 1-6. - THE JUDGMENT ON ASSYRIA AND DELIVERANCE OF JERUSALEM, STATED GENERALLY. Events had progressed since the preceding prophecies were delivered. The negotiations carried on with Sennacherib had been futile (ver. 7), the heavy fine imposed and paid (2 Kings 18:14) had been of no avail (ver. 18); the Assyrian monarch was still dissatisfied, and threatened a second siege. Already he was upon his march, spoiling and ravaging (ver. 1). The people of the country districts had removed into the town (ver. 8) - in a little time the vast host might be expected to appear before the walls. All was terror, grief, and confusion. Under these circumstances, Isaiah is once more commissioned to declare the approaching discomfiture of the mighty conqueror, and deliverance of Jerusalem out of his hand (vers. 3, 4). The deliverance ushers in a reign of righteousness (Vers. 5, 6). Verse 1. - Woe to thee that spoilest. The \"spoiler\" is here, evidently, Assyria - the world-power of this entire group of prophecies (see especially Isaiah 30:31; Isaiah 31:8), and the greatest \"spoiler\" of Isaiah's time. Thou wast not spoiled; i.e. \"that hast not yet been spoiled thyself.\" A covert threat is conveyed in the words. And dealest treacherously; rather, usest violence (compare the comment on Isaiah 21:2). When thou shalt cease to spoil, etc. Conquering nations cannot with safety pause on their career. Their aggressions have roused so many enmities that, let them cease to attack, and at once they are attacked in their turn. Every man's baud is against the spoiler whose hand has been against every man.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah33:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTO LORD, be gracious unto us; we have waited for thee: be thou their arm every morning, our salvation also in the time of trouble.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 2. - O Lord, etc. The mingling of prayer with prophecy is very unusual, and indicative of highly excited feeling. Isaiah realizes fully the danger of his people and nation, and knows that without prayer there is no deliverance. His prayer is at once an outpouring of his own heart, and an example to others. We have waited for thee (comp. Isaiah 8:17; Isaiah 26:8). Their Am; i.e. \"the Arm of thy people.\" Every morning. Continually, day by day, since their need of thy support is continual.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah33:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAt the noise of the tumult the people fled; at the lifting up of thyself the nations were scattered.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 3. - At the noise of the tumult the people fled; rather, the peoples; i.e. the contingents from many nations which made up the huge army of Sennacherib. The \"noise\" is that caused by God \"lifting up himself\" (comp. Psalm 29:3-9).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah33:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd your spoil shall be gathered like the gathering of the caterpiller: as the running to and fro of locusts shall he run upon them.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 4. - Your spoil shall be gathered. The \"spoiling\" of Assyria would commence with the discomfiture of the great host. In the historical narrative (2 Kings 19:35; Isaiah 37:36) nothing is said of it; but, beyond a doubt, when the host was to a largo extent destroyed, and the remainder fled, there must have been an enormous booty left behind, which the enemies of the Assyrians would naturally seize. A further spoiling of the fugitives probably followed; and, the prestige of the great king being gone, marauding bands would probably on all sides ravage the Assyrian territory. Like the gathering of the caterpillar. The \"caterpillar\" (khasil) is probably the grub out of which the locust develops - a very destructive insect. Shall he run. It would be better to render, shall they run. The word, indeed, is in the singular; but it is used distributively, of the various spoilers.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah33:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe LORD is exalted; for he dwelleth on high: he hath filled Zion with judgment and righteousness.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 5. - The Lord is exalted. His destruction of the Assyrian host is an exaltation of God; i.e. it causes him to be exalted in the thoughts of those who have cognizance of the fact (comp. Exodus 15:14-16; Psalm 96:3-10, etc.). It is an indication to them that he has his dwelling on high, and is the true King of heaven. He hath filled Zion with judgment, etc. (comp. Isaiah 32:15-17). The destruction is, in part, the result, in part the cause, of the Jews once more turning to God, putting away their iniquities, and establishing the reign of justice and righteousness in the land (see Isaiah 1:26).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah33:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd wisdom and knowledge shall be the stability of thy times, and strength of salvation: the fear of the LORD is his treasure.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 6. - Wisdom and knowledge shall be the stability of thy times; literally, and the stability of thy times shall be (i.e. consist in) a rich store of salvations, wisdom, and knowledge. The prophet here addresses the people of Judah in the second person, though in the next clause he reverts to the third. Such transitions are common in ancient compositions, and especially characterize the writings of Isaiah. The fear of the Lord is his treasure; i.e. the wisdom intended is that which is based upon \"the fear of the Lord\" (Psalm 111:10). This will be at once Judah's \"treasure,\" and a guarantee of stability to her government and institutions (compare the Homiletics on Isaiah 32:15-17).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah33:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBehold, their valiant ones shall cry without: the ambassadors of peace shall weep bitterly.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 7-12. - THE PROPHET ENTERS FURTHER INTO PARTICULARS. Having \"sketched the main outlines of his revelation,\" Isaiah proceeds to \"fill in and apply the details\" (Cheyne). He first describes the despair and low condition of Judah: the men of war wailing aloud; the ambassadors just returned kern Laehish weeping at the ill success of their embassy; all travelling stopped; the land wasted and made a desert; the Assyrians still ravaging and destroying, despite the peace which had been made (2 Kings 18:14-16). Then suddenly he sees Jehovah rousing himself (ver. 10), and the Assyrians con-stoned, as if with a fire (vers. 11, 12). Verse 7. - Behold, their valiant ones shall cry without. \"Their lion-hearts \"(Cheyne); \"heroes\" (Delitzsch). Literally, lions of God (comp. Isaiah 29:1). They raise a cry of mourning in the streets, with child-like effusiveness (comp. Herod., 8:99; 9:24). The ambassadors of peace. Hezekiah probably sent several embassies to Sennacherib in the course of the war. One went to Lachish, offering submission, in B.C. 701 (2 Kings 18:14); another to Nineveh, with tribute and presents, in the same or the following year (2 Kings 18:15; comp. 'Eponym Canon,' p. 135). A third probably sought to deprecate Sennacherib's auger, when he made his second invasion (2 Kings 18:17) in B.C. 699 (?). These last would seem to be the \"ambassadors\" of this verse.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah33:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe highways lie waste, the wayfaring man ceaseth: he hath broken the covenant, he hath despised the cities, he regardeth no man.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 8. - The highways lie waste {croup. Judges 5:6). The meaning is that' they were unoccupied. Fear of the Assyrians restrained men from travelling. He hath broken the covenant. Sennacherib, when he accepted the sum of money sent him by Hezekiah (2 Kings 18:15; 'Eponym Canon,' p. 135), must have consented to leave him unmolested for the future. But in a very short time we find him, apparently without any reasonable pretext, sending a fresh expedition against Jerusalem, requiring it to be admitted within the walls, and even threatening the city with destruction (2 Kings 18:17-35; 2 Kings 19:10-13). Isaiah, therefore, taxes him with having broken his covenant. Despised cities. \"Sennacherib,\" says Delitzsch, \"continued to storm the fortified places of Judah, in violation of his agreement.\" Regardeth no man; i.e. \"pays no attention to the protests that are made against his infraction of the treaty - does not care what is said or thought of him.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah33:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe earth mourneth and languisheth: Lebanon is ashamed and hewn down: Sharon is like a wilderness; and Bashan and Carmel shake off their fruits.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 9. - The earth mourneth; rather, the land. Lebanon is... hewn down; rather, as in the margin, is withered away (comp. Isaiah 19:6). Lebanon, Sharon, Carmel, and Bashan are the four most beautiful regions of the Holy Land, taking the word in its widest extent. Lebanon is the northern mountain-range, one hundred and twenty miles in length, clad with cedars and firs, and generally crowned with snow, whence the name (from laban, white). Sharon is \"the broad rich tract of land\" which stretches southwards from the foot of Carmel, and melts into the Shefelah, noted for its flowers (Song of Solomon 2:1) and forests (Josephus, 'Ant. Jud.,' 14:13, § 3). Carmel is the upland dividing Sharon from the Esdraelon plain, famous for its \"rocky dells\" and \"deep jungles of copse.\" Finally, Bashan is the trans-Jordanic upland, stretching from the flanks of Hermon to Gilead, celebrated for its \"high downs\" and \"wide-sweeping plains,\" for its \"forests of oak,\" and in ancient times for its herds of wild cattle. All are said to be \"waste,\" \"withered,\" and the like, partly on account of the Assyrian ravages, but perhaps still more as sympathizing with the Jewish nation in their distress - \"ashamed\" for them, and clad in mourning on their account. Shake off their fruits; rather, perhaps, shake down their leaves. Mr. Cheyne conjectures that the prophecy was delivered in autumn.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah33:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTNow will I rise, saith the LORD; now will I be exalted; now will I lift up myself.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 10. - Now will I rise. Judah's extremity is Jehovah's opportunity. \"Now\" at length the time is come for God to show himself, tic will rise from his throne, and actively display his power; he will exalt himself above the heathen - lift himself up above the nations.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah33:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTYe shall conceive chaff, ye shall bring forth stubble: your breath, as fire, shall devour you.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 11. - Ye shall conceive chaff.

Nay, the fury of the foe against Jerusalem shall be the fire to destroy them.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah33:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the people shall be as the burnings of lime: as thorns cut up shall they be burned in the fire.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 12. - The people; rather, the peoples, as in ver. 3; i.e. the nations composing the Assyrian army. As the burnings of lime; as thorns. Things that fire consumes utterly and quickly.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah33:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHear, ye that are far off, what I have done; and, ye that are near, acknowledge my might.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 13-24. - REFLECTIONS ON ASSYRIA'S OVERTHROW VIEWED AS ACCOMPLISHED. The prophet's first thought is, how wonderfully the overthrow has manifested the might of God (ver. 13). Next, how it must thrill with fear the hearts of the wicked among his people (ver. 14). Thirdly, how the righteous are by it placed in security, and can look back with joy to their escape, and can with confidence look forward to a future of happiness and tranquil lily (vers. 15-24). Messianic ideas intermingle with these latter thoughts (vers. 17, 23), the image of a happy, tranquil Judah melting into that of Messiah's glorious kingdom. Verse 13. - Hear, ye that are far off, etc. Jehovah speaks by the mouth of his prophet, and calls on the nations of the earth, far and near, to consider and acknowledge his might, as shown in his judgment on Assyria (comp. Exodus 15:14-16).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah33:14VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe sinners in Zion are afraid; fearfulness hath surprised the hypocrites. Who among us shall dwell with the devouring fire? who among us shall dwell with everlasting burnings?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 14. - The sinners in Zion are afraid. The prophet proceeds to speak in his own person. The judgment on Assyria, he says, cannot but strike terror into the hearts of the immoral and irreligious in Zion. They cannot fail to realize their own danger, and to tremble at it. Who among us, they will say, can dwell with the devouring fire? Who among us shall dwell with everlasting burnings? They will recognize God as \"a consuming Fire\" (Deuteronomy 4:24), whose next outbreak may be upon themselves, and will shudder at the prospect.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah33:15VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHe that walketh righteously, and speaketh uprightly; he that despiseth the gain of oppressions, that shaketh his hands from holding of bribes, that stoppeth his ears from hearing of blood, and shutteth his eyes from seeing evil;VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 15. - He that walketh righteously, etc. The prophet answers the question which he has supposed to be asked. None can endure the revelation of the presence of God but the holy and the upright - \"he that hath clean hands, and a pure heart; who hath not lifted up his soul unto vanity, nor sworn deceitfully\" (Psalm 24:4; comp. 15:2-5). Uprightness is then explained as consisting in six things mainly -NEWLINENEWLINE(1) Just conduct;NEWLINENEWLINE(2) righteous speech;NEWLINENEWLINE(3) hatred of oppression;NEWLINENEWLINE(4) rejection of bribes;NEWLINENEWLINE(5) closing the ear against murderous suggestions;NEWLINENEWLINE(6) closing the eye against sinful sights.NEWLINENEWLINEWe may compare with this summa, y those of the Psalms above quoted. No enumeration is complete, or intended to be complete. Isaiah's has special reference to the favorite sins of the time - injustice (Isaiah 3:15; Isaiah 5:23), oppression (Isaiah 1:17, 23; Isaiah 3:12, 14; Isaiah 5:7; etc.), the receiving of bribes (Isaiah 1:23; Hosea 4:18; Micah 3:11), and bloodshed (Isaiah 1:15, 21; Isaiah 59:3).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah33:16VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHe shall dwell on high: his place of defence shall be the munitions of rocks: bread shall be given him; his waters shall be sure.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 16. - He shall dwell on high; literally, inhabit heights - live, as it were, in the perpetual presence of God. His place of defense shall be the munitions of rocks; rather, strongholds of rocks (i.e. rocky strongholds) shall be his refuge. He shall fly to God, as his \"Rock and his Fortress\" (Psalm 18:2), not from him, as his \"Enemy and Avenger\" (Pc. 8:2). Bread... waters; i.e. all that is necessary for his support and sustenance. Shall be given him... shall be sure; rather, is given him... is sure. Godliness has \"the promise of the life that now is,\" as well as that of the life \"which is to come\" (1 Timothy 4:8).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah33:17VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThine eyes shall see the king in his beauty: they shall behold the land that is very far off.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 17. - Thine eyes. Another transition. Here from the third person to the second, the prophet now addressing those righteous ones of whom he has been speaking in the two preceding verses. Shall see the King in his beauty. The Messianic King, whoever he might be, and whenever he might make his appearance. It has been said that beauty is not predicated of the heavenly King (Cheyne); but Zechariah 9:17; Psalm 45:2; and Canticles, passim, contradict this assertion. \"How great is his beauty;\" \"Thou art fairer than the children of men;\" \"His mouth is most sweet; yea, he is altogether lovely.\" The land that is very far off; literally, the land of far distances. Bishop Lowth renders, \"Thine own land far extended,\" and so Delitzsch and Mr. Cheyne. But if \"the King\" is Messianic, so doubtless is \"the land\" - the world-wide tract over which Messiah will reign (Revelation 21:1).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah33:18VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThine heart shall meditate terror. Where is the scribe? where is the receiver? where is he that counted the towers?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 18. - Thine heart shall meditate terror; i.e. \"thou shalt look back upon the past time of terror, the dreadful period of the siege, and contrast it with thy present happiness.\" Mr. Cheyne quotes as an illustration, appositely enough, Virgil's \"Et haec olim meminisse juvabit.\" Where is the scribe... the receiver?.... he that counted the towers? Where now are the Assyrian officials - the scribe, who registered the amount of the tribute and booty ('Ancient Monarchies,' vol. 1. p. 476); the receiver, who weighed the gold and silver carefully in a balance (Layard, 'Nineveh and its Remains,' vol. 2. p. 377); and the engineer officer who surveyed the place to be besieged, estimated its strength, and counted its towers? All have perished or have fled away in dismay.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah33:19VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThou shalt not see a fierce people, a people of a deeper speech than thou canst perceive; of a stammering tongue, that thou canst not understand.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 19. - Thou shalt not see a fierce people, etc.; rather, thou shalt see no more that barbarous people - the Assyrians - a people gruff of speech that rhea caner, or hear them, stammering of tongue that thee caner not understand them (comp. Isaiah 28:11). The generation which witnessed the destruction of Sennacherib's army probably did not see the Assyrians again. It was not till about B.C. 670 that Manasseh was \"taken with hooks by the captains of the King of Assyria, and carried to Babylon\" (2 Chronicles 33:11).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah33:20VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTLook upon Zion, the city of our solemnities: thine eyes shall see Jerusalem a quiet habitation, a tabernacle that shall not be taken down; not one of the stakes thereof shall ever be removed, neither shall any of the cords thereof be broken.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 20. - Look upon Zion, etc.; i.e. turn thy thoughts, O Judah, from the past to the present - from the time of the siege to the time after the siege terminated. The city of our solemnities; or, of our festal meetings; the city where we celebrate our Passovers, our Feasts of Weeks, our Feasts of Ingathering, and the like. A tent that shall not be taken down. There is, perhaps, a reference to Sennacherib's threat to remove the entire population from Jerusalem to a far country (Isaiah 36:19). This threat should not take effect. Not one of the stakes thereof shall ever be removed. By \"the stakes\" are meant \"the tent-pegs,\" to which the ropes are fastened which keep the tent firm (comp. Exodus 27:10; Exodus 38:18, 31; Judges 4:21). The promise that they shall \"never\" be removed must be understood either as conditional on the people's walking uprightly (ver. 15), or as a promise of a long continuance merely.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah33:21VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut there the glorious LORD will be unto us a place of broad rivers and streams; wherein shall go no galley with oars, neither shall gallant ship pass thereby.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 21. - But there the glorious Lord will be unto us a Place of broad rivers; rather, there in majesty the Lord is ours; [the Lord who is] a Place of broad rivers, etc. Some critics think that \"a place of broad rivers\" may be exegetical of sham, \"there,\" and so apply it to Jerusalem; but the majority regard the phrase as applied directly to Jehovah. As he is \"a Place to hide in\" (Psalm 32:7; Psalm 119:114), so he may be \"a Place of broad rivers,\" full, i.e. of refreshment and spiritual blessing. Wherein shall go no galley. The river of God's grace, which \"makes glad the city of God, \"shall bear no enemy on its surface, allow no invader to cross it.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah33:22VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor the LORD is our judge, the LORD is our lawgiver, the LORD is our king; he will save us.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah33:23VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThy tacklings are loosed; they could not well strengthen their mast, they could not spread the sail: then is the prey of a great spoil divided; the lame take the prey.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 23. - Thy tacklings are loosed. The comparing of God to a river has led to the representation of Judah's enemies as warships (ver. 21). This causes Judah herself to be viewed as a ship - a badly appointed ship, which has to contend with one whose equipment is perfect. The prophet's thoughts have traveled back to the existing state of things. They could not well strengthen their mast; rather, they cannot hold firm the lower part of their mast. The mast had its lower extremity inserted into a hole in a cross-beam, and required to be kept in place by the ropes. If they were loose, it might slip out of the hole and fall overboard. They could not spread the sail; rather, they cannot spread the ensign. The ensign would seem to have been attached to the top of the mast. If the mast fell, it would no longer be spread out, so as to be seen. Then is the prey of a great spoil divided. The word \"then\" is emphatic. Now the disabled ship seems incapable of coping with its enemy. Then (after Assyria's overthrow) Judah will obtain an immense spoil (see ver. 4). Even the lame shall have their portion.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah33:24VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the inhabitant shall not say, I am sick: the people that dwell therein shall be forgiven their iniquity.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 24. - And the inhabitant shall not say, I am sick.

Jeremiah 22:19; Jeremiah 36:30). Such treatment of the dead was regarded as a shame and a disgrace. It was on some occasions an intentional insult (Jeremiah 22:19); but here the idea is rather that it would be impossible to bury the slain on account of their number. In ancient times corpses often lay unburied on battle-fields (Herod., 3:12). The mountains shall be molted with their blood. When the feelings of the prophet are excited, he shrinks from no hyperbole. Here he represents the blood of God's enemies as shed in such torrents that mountains are melted by it.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah34:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd all the host of heaven shall be dissolved, and the heavens shall be rolled together as a scroll: and all their host shall fall down, as the leaf falleth off from the vine, and as a falling fig from the fig tree.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 4. - All the host of heaven shall be dissolved. A dissolution of the material frame of the heavens, in which the moon and stars are regarded as set, seems to be intended (comp. Matthew 24:29; 2 Peter 3:10). The slaughter of God's enemies is here connected with the cud of the world, as in the Book of Revelation (Revelation 19:11-21). The heavens shall be rolled together as a scroll; literally, as a book. Ancient books were written on long strips of paper or parchment, which, when unrolled, extended to many yards in length, but which might be rolled together \"by means of one or two smooth round sticks into a very small compass.\" Such a rolling together of the widely extended heavens is here intended, not a shriveling by means of heat (comp. Revelation 6:14). All their host shall fall (comp. Matthew 24:29, \"The stars shall fall from heaven\").NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah34:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor my sword shall be bathed in heaven: behold, it shall come down upon Idumea, and upon the people of my curse, to judgment.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 5. - My sword shall be bathed in heaven; rather, has been bathed, or has been made drunken (ἐνεθύσθη, LXX.) in heaven. Some suppose a reference to the old\" war in heaven,\" when the sword of Divine justice was drawn against the devil and his angels. Others regard the sword now to be used against the Idumeans as first, in heaven, \"made drunken\" with the Divine anger. It shall come down upon Idumea (comp. Isaiah 63:1-6). The Edomites first showed themselves enemies of Israel when they refused to allow the Israelites, under Moses, \"a passage through their border\" (Numbers 20:14-21). David subdued them (2 Samuel 9:14); but they revolted from Jehoram (2 Chronicles 21:8-10), and were thenceforward among the most bitter adversaries of the southern kingdom. They \"smote Judah\" in the reign of Ahaz (2 Chronicles 28:17), and were always ready to \"shed the blood of the children of Israel by the force of the sword in the time of their calamity\" (Ezekiel 35:5). Amos speaks of them very much in the same tone as Isaiah (Amos 1:11, 12). They ultimately \"filled up the measure of their iniquities\" by open rejoicing when Jerusalem was destroyed, and the people led away captive by Nebuchadnezzar (Psalm 137:7; Obadiah 1:10-14; Lamentations 4:21, 22; Ezekiel 35:10-13). In the present passage we must regard the Edomites as representative of the enemies of God's people generally (see the introductory paragraph). The people of my curse; i.e. \"the people on whom I have laid a curse\" - the Edomites. Esau was to \"serve\" Jacob (Genesis 25:23; Genesis 27:40), Edom to be \"a possession\" for Judah (Numbers 24:18). God had said of Edom, probably before Isaiah uttered the present prophecy, \"For three transgressions of Edom, and for four, I will not turn away the punishment thereof... but I will send a fire upon Teman, which shall devour the palaces of Bozrah\" (Amos 1:11, 12). Thus Edom was under a curse.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah34:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe sword of the LORD is filled with blood, it is made fat with fatness, and with the blood of lambs and goats, with the fat of the kidneys of rams: for the LORD hath a sacrifice in Bozrah, and a great slaughter in the land of Idumea.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 6. - The sword of the Lord is filled; or, glutted (Lowth). The tense is \"the perfect of prophetic certainty.\" It is made fat with fatness. \"Fed, as it were, on the fat of sacrifices\" (see Leviticus 3:3, 4, 9, 10, 15; Leviticus 7:3, etc.). Lambs... goats... rams. The lesser cattle represent the lower classes of those about to be slain, while the \"unicorns\" and \"bullocks\" of ver. 7 represent the upper classes - the great men and leaders. The Lord hath a sacrifice in Bozrah. This Bozrah, one of the principal cities of Idumaea, is to be distinguished from \"Bozrah of Moab,\" which was known to the Romans as \"Bostra.\" It lay in the hilly country to the south-cast of the Dead Sea, about thirty-five miles north of Petra, and was one of the earliest settlements of the descendants of Esau, being mentioned as a well-known place in Genesis 34:33). The threats here uttered against it are repeated by Jeremiah (Jeremiah 49:13), who says that \"Bozrah shall become a desolation, a reproach, a waste, and a curse; all the cities thereof [i.e. the dependent cities] shall be perpetual wastes.\" Bozrah is probably identified with the modern El-Busaireh, a village of about fifty houses, occupying a site in the position above indicated, amid ruins which seem to be those of a considerable city (Burckhardt, 'Syria,' p. 407; Robinson, 'Researches in Palestine,' vol. 2. pp. 570, 571).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah34:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the unicorns shall come down with them, and the bullocks with the bulls; and their land shall be soaked with blood, and their dust made fat with fatness.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 7. - The unicorns; Bishop Lowth renders ream by \"wild goats;\" Mr. Cheyne by \"buffaloes.\" Probably the wild ox, a native of the trans-Jordanic region, is intended (see Mr. Houghton's paper on the animals of the Assyrian bas-reliefs, in the 'Transactions of the Society of Bibl. Archaeology,' vol. 5. p. 336). Shall come down; rather, shall go down; i.e. shall fall and perish (comp. Jeremiah 50:27).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah34:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor it is the day of the LORD'S vengeance, and the year of recompences for the controversy of Zion.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 8. - The day of the Lord's vengeance (comp. Isaiah 61:2 and Isaiah 63:4). In all three places the \"day\" of God's vengeance is contrasted with the \"year\" of his recompense, to show how infinite is his mercy, how short-lived, comparatively speaking, his auger. Mr. Cheyne well compares the concluding clauses of the second commandment, where \"retribution is declared to descend to the third and fourth generation, but mercy to the thousandth.\" Recompenses for the controversy of Zion; rather, for the vindication of Zion; i.e. for the maintenance of her right in the quarrel between her and her enemies.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah34:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the streams thereof shall be turned into pitch, and the dust thereof into brimstone, and the land thereof shall become burning pitch.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 9. - And the streams thereof; i.e. \"the streams of the land of Edom.\" Though Edom has no perennial rivers, it has numerous torrent-courses to carry off the winter rains (see 2 Kings 3:20-22). These should run with pitch, instead of water. The general idea is that Edom should be visited with a destruction like that of Sodom and Gomorrah (Genesis 19:24; comp. Jeremiah 49:18). But the prophet scarcely intends his words to be taken literally; he is making Edom a type or representation of God's enemies, and the gist of his teaching is that a dreadful vengeance, an utter destruction, will come upon all who set themselves up against the Most High. In the next verse he declares that the vengeance will be eternal (comp. Isaiah 66:24).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah34:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTIt shall not be quenched night nor day; the smoke thereof shall go up for ever: from generation to generation it shall lie waste; none shall pass through it for ever and ever.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 10. - None shall pass through it forever and ever. There was a literal fulfillment of the prophecies against Edom to a considerable extent. Malachi, writing three hundred years after Isaiah, says that the \"mountains and the heritage of Esau were laid waste for the dragons of the wilderness\" (Malachi 1:3); and he makes the Edomites themselves exclaim, \"We are impoverished, but we will return and build the desolate places\" (Malachi 1:4). A certain amount of recovery must have followed; and in the Maccabee period Edom appears once more as an adversary of Israel, and an adversary of some importance (1 Macc. 5:3, 65). Gradually, however, she had to yield to the superior power of Judaea, and was even ruled by viceroys, whom the Maccabee princes nominated. One of these, Antipater, was the father of Herod the Great. From his time Idumea languished until, in the seventh century after Christ, it was overrun and conquered by the Mohammedan Arabs, who completed its ruin. It is now, and has been for above a thousand years, one of the most desolate tracts upon the earth's surface.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah34:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut the cormorant and the bittern shall possess it; the owl also and the raven shall dwell in it: and he shall stretch out upon it the line of confusion, and the stones of emptiness.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 11. - The cormorant and the bittern shall possess it. Compare the prophecy against Babylon in Isaiah 14:23. The Hebrew word translated \"cormorant,\" is now generally regarded as designating the \"pelican,\" while the one rendered \"bittern\" is thought by some to mean \"hedgehog\" or \"porcupine.\" Animals that delight in solitude are certainly meant, but the particular species is, more or less, matter of conjecture. He shall stretch out upon it; rather, and one shall stretch out upon it. The verb is used impersonally. The line of confusion, and the stones of emptiness; rather, the line of desolation, and the plummet of emptiness (comp. 2 Kings 21:13; Lamentations 2:8; Amos 7:7, 8). The destruction of cities was effected by rule and measure, probably because different portions of the task were assigned to different sets of laborers, and, if the work was to be completely done, it required to be done systematically. Here, the measuring-tape and the plumb-line are to be these of tohu and vohu, or of the eternal chaos out of which God, by his word, produced order (Genesis 1:2).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah34:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThey shall call the nobles thereof to the kingdom, but none shall be there, and all her princes shall be nothing.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 12. - They shall call the nobles, etc.; rather, as for her nobles, there shall be none there for them to call to the kingdom. The nobles are termed horim, probably because the right of succession to the kingdom was vested in the descendants of the Horites, from whom the Edomites took their territory (Genesis 36:20, 29, 30). These having died out, there would be no one to appoint as king.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah34:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd thorns shall come up in her palaces, nettles and brambles in the fortresses thereof: and it shall be an habitation of dragons, and a court for owls.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 13. - Thorns shall come up in her palaces. The \"palaces\" of Bozrah are mentioned also by Amos (Amos 1:12), and are threatened with destruction by fire. Amid their ruins should grow up thorns and briars. It shall be an habitation of dragons; or, of jackals (see the comment on Isaiah 13:22). Owls; literally, daughters of screaming - a description better suited to the owl than to the ostrich, which some regard as the bird meant.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah34:14VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe wild beasts of the desert shall also meet with the wild beasts of the island, and the satyr shall cry to his fellow; the screech owl also shall rest there, and find for herself a place of rest.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 14. - Wild beasts of the desert... wild beasts of the island. In the original, tsiyim and 'iyim - \"wailers\" and \"howlers\" - probably jackals and wolves, or wolves and hyenas.\" The satyr (see the comment on Isaiah 13:21). The screech owl The word here used, lilith, occurs only in this place. It may be doubted whether any bird, or other animal, is meant. Lilit was the name of a female demon, or wicked fairy, in whom the Assyrians believed - a being thought to vex and persecute her victims in their sleep. The word is probably a derivative from leilah, night, and designates\" the spirit of the night\" - a mischievous being, who took advantage of the darkness to play fantastic tricks. A Jewish legend made Lilith the first wife of Adam, and said that, having pronounced the Divine Name as a charm, she was changed into a devil. It was her special delight to murder young children (Buxtorf, 'Lex. Rabbin.,' ad roe.). The prophets, when they employ poetic imagery, are not tied down to fact, but are free to use the beliefs of their contemporaries in order to heighten the force of their descriptions.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah34:15VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThere shall the great owl make her nest, and lay, and hatch, and gather under her shadow: there shall the vultures also be gathered, every one with her mate.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 15. - The great owl; rather, the arrow-snake (Serpens jaculus). Gather under her shadow; i.e. \"gather her young ones under her.\" There shall the vultures also be gathered; rather, there verily shall the vultures assemble.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah34:16VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTSeek ye out of the book of the LORD, and read: no one of these shall fail, none shall want her mate: for my mouth it hath commanded, and his spirit it hath gathered them.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 16. - Seek ye out of the book of the Lord. By \"the book of the Lord\" some understand a collected volume of Moses and the prophets, psalmists, etc., previous to Isaiah's time, which they suppose to have existed in his day. But there is no evidence of any such collection. It is better to understand the expression of Isaiah's own prophecies, or of such a collection of them as he had made previously to the composition of the present chapter. Nothing contained in the entire book should, he says, fail of its accomplishment. Even the minutiae of the present chapter should, each and all, have their fulfillment, though not, perhaps, in every case a literal one. My mouth... his Spirit. The \"mouth\" of the prophet and the \"Spirit\" of God, which dictates to him what he is to write, are in accord; and the Spirit will bring to pass what the mouth inspired by him has \"commanded.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah34:17VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he hath cast the lot for them, and his hand hath divided it unto them by line: they shall possess it for ever, from generation to generation shall they dwell therein.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 17. - He hath cast the lot for them. God, who allots to all the nations of the earth their several countries, has now allotted Idumea to the unclean beasts and birds and reptiles which have been mentioned; henceforth it is formally assigned to them as their habitation. It is throughout to be understood that Idumea stands for the world power, which resists God and will be finally abased and put to shame.NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINE","Isa.35":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah35:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe wilderness and the solitary place shall be glad for them; and the desert shall rejoice, and blossom as the rose.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 1-10. - THE GLORY OF THE LAST TIMES. On the punishment of God's enemies will follow the peace, prosperity, and glory of his Church. Previously, the Church is in affliction, waste, and desolate. Its enemies once removed, destroyed, swept out of the way, it rises instantly in all its beauty to a condition which words are poor to paint. The highest resources of the poetic art are called in to give some idea of the glory and happiness of the final Church of the redeemed. Verse 1. - The wilderness and the solitary place shall be glad for them; rather, the wilderness, and the dry place, shall be glad. The Church, that has been long wasted and kept under by the wicked, shall, at their destruction, feel a sense of relief, and so of joy. The desert shall rejoice, and blossom. The first result of the joy shall be a putting forth of lovely products. Blossoms, beautiful as the rose or the narcissus (Kay), shall spring up all over the parched ground, and make it a parterre of flowers. The blossoms are either graces unknown in the time of affliction, or saintly characters of a new and high type.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah35:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTIt shall blossom abundantly, and rejoice even with joy and singing: the glory of Lebanon shall be given unto it, the excellency of Carmel and Sharon, they shall see the glory of the LORD, and the excellency of our God.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 2. - It shall blossom abundantly, and rejoice even with joy and singing; rather, with dancing and singing. Dancing and singing were the ordinary manifestations of religions joy (Exodus 15:1, 20, 21; Judges 11:34; Judges 21:19-21; 2 Samuel 6:5, 14, 15; Psalm 30:11, etc.), and would naturally follow the great deliverance of the Church from the power of its enemies. The clause is a touch of realism intruded into a prolonged metaphor or allegory, and is quite in the manner of Isaiah (comp. Isaiah 14:7; Isaiah 26:1; Isaiah 30:32, etc.). The glory of Lebanon... the excellency of Carmel and Sharon; i.e. productiveness of all kinds, of abundant harvests, fruits, and flowers, and forest trees (comp. Isaiah 10:18, 19, 33, 34; Isaiah 32:15) - a resumption and prolongation of the metaphor in ver. 1. They shall see the glory of the Lord. The culminating joy and delight and blessedness of the Church shall be the vision of God - either the spiritual perception of his presence (Matthew 5:8; Romans 1:20) or the actual beatific vision (1 Corinthians 13:12; Revelation 21:11, 23; Revelation 22:4), the first during the probation period, the second in the state of final bliss.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah35:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTStrengthen ye the weak hands, and confirm the feeble knees.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 3. - Strengthen ye the weak hands. In the Church of the redeemed there will be \"weak\" brethren as well as strong, \"feeble\" as well as healthful (see 1 Corinthians 3:1; Galatians 6:1; Hebrews 5:12-14). God, by the mouth of his prophet, calls on the strong to impart of their strength to their weaker brethren, uplifting their \"weak hands,\" as Aaron and Hur did those of Moses (Exodus 17:12), and \"confirming\" or sustaining their \"feeble knees.\" So St. Paul: \"We that are strong ought to bear the infirmities of the weak, and not to please ourselves\" (Romans 15:1).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah35:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTSay to them that are of a fearful heart, Be strong, fear not: behold, your God will come with vengeance, even God with a recompence; he will come and save you.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 4. - Say to them that are of a fearful heart. There will be fearful and trembling hearts always, even among the saints of God. These are to be encouraged and assured that God Will come to their aid, will avenge them of their spiritual enemies, reward their efforts to serve him, and in the end \"save\" them. He will come and save you; rather, he will come himself to save yon. There is One alone who can save, and he must do it himself, and, to do it, he must \"come\" to us. The words were at once an announcement of the Incarnation, and a promise to every trembling, doubting heart - a promise of direct Divine assistance, of the presence of God within us, of help potent to save. The predominant thought of the prophet appears to have been Messianic, and hence the burst of glorious prophecy which follows - a burst of prophecy most inadequately expounded of the time of the return from the Captivity.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah35:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen the eyes of the blind shall be opened, and the ears of the deaf shall be unstopped.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 5, 6. - Then the eyes of the blind shall be opened. In the literal sense, our Lord claims these prophecies to himself and his earthly career, when he says to the disciples of John the Baptist, \"Go and show John those things which ye do hear and see, the blind receive their sight, and the lame walk, the lepers are cleansed, and the deaf hear\" (Matthew 11:4, 5); but they have doubtless a further spiritual sense, in which they belong to the whole period of his mediatorial kingdom, and are correlative to former utterances of the prophet, in which the blinded eyes and deaf ears and stammering tongues of God's people had been spoken of and made the subject of complaint (see Isaiah 6:10; Isaiah 29:10, etc.). Our Lord's miracles of bodily healing, performed during the three years of his earthly ministry, were types and foreshadowings of those far more precious miracles of spiritual healing, which the great Physician is ever performing on the sick and infirm of his Church, by opening the eyes of their understandings, and unstopping the deaf ears of their hearts, and loosening the strings of their tongues to hymn his praise, and stirring their paralyzed spiritual natures to active exertions in his service. Doubtless Isaiah, or the Spirit which guided him, intended to point to both these classes of miracles, and not to one of them only, as characteristic of the Messiah's kingdom.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah35:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen shall the lame man leap as an hart, and the tongue of the dumb sing: for in the wilderness shall waters break out, and streams in the desert.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 6. - For in the wilderness shall waters break out. The wilderness of humanity shall be renovated by a large effluence of God's grace (comp. Isaiah 30:25; Isaiah 32:2; Isaiah 41:18; Isaiah 43:19; John 7:37, 38).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah35:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the parched ground shall become a pool, and the thirsty land springs of water: in the habitation of dragons, where each lay, shall be grass with reeds and rushes.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 7. - The parched ground shall become, etc.; rather, the glistening sand. That hot glow of the parched desert soil, which produces the mirage, shall be replaced by a real lake of cool water. Illusive imitations of goodness shall give way to the display of genuine virtues and excellences. In the habitation of dragons; or, according to some, of jackals - the driest and most desolate of all places. Shall be grass with reeds and rushes; i.e. \"shall be a luxuriant vegetation, like that on the banks of the Nile\" (comp. vers. 1, 2).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah35:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd an highway shall be there, and a way, and it shall be called The way of holiness; the unclean shall not pass over it; but it shall be for those: the wayfaring men, though fools, shall not err therein.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 8. - And an highway shall be there, and a way (comp. Isaiah 30:21). There shall be a clear \"way\" marked out in which all shall be bound to walk - a \"strait and narrow way\" doubtless (Matthew 7:14), but one not readily missed. The way shall be called The way of holiness. It shall be that path through the dangers and difficulties of life which holiness points out and requires. The unclean shall not pass over it. It is tempting to imagine that there is here a reference to the famous chinvat peretu of the Zoro-astrians - the \"bridge of the gatherer\" - along which all souls had to pass in order to reach the abode of the blessed, but which the souls of the wicked never succeeded in passing ('Ancient Monarchies,' vol. it. p. 339). The 'bridge of the gatherer\" is, however, in the other world, not in this world; but Isaiah's \"highway\" is here. It is that right course of life, which \"the unclean\" do not follow, though they might do so if they chose, but which the righteous follow to their great gain and advantage. But it shall be for those; rather, as in the margin, but he shall be with them; God, i.e. shall be with those who seek to walk in the way, and not to err from it. He shall direct them, support them, sustain their footsteps. The wayfaring men; rather, they that walk in the way - that make up their minds to try to walk in it. Though fools; i.e. however simple and unlearned they may be - \"Ne simplicissimi quidem\" (Rosenmüller). Shall not err therein; shall not wander from the way through mere simplicity. It shall be easy to find, difficult to miss.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah35:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTNo lion shall be there, nor any ravenous beast shall go up thereon, it shall not be found there; but the redeemed shall walk there:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 9. - No lion shall be there. No great tyrannical power, like Assyria (Nahum 2:11, 12) or Babylon, shall arrest the energies of the Church, take it captive, or enslave it. No ravenous beast shall make it his prey. In proportion as the Church is holy (ver. 8) it shall be free from the molestation of bloody persecutors (see Isaiah 11:9). The redeemed - those whom God has purchased for his own (Exodus 6:6; Hosea 13:14) - shall be free to walk there, untroubled by cruel enemies.

The blessedness of the last times would be incomplete to Jewish ideas without this crowning feature. There had already been a great dispersion of the faithful (Isaiah 1:7-9); there was to be a still greater one (Isaiah 11:11); Israel could not be content or happy until her \"outcasts\" were recalled, \"the dispersed of Judah gathered together from the four corners of the earth\" (Isaiah 11:12). The return here prophesied is again announced, in almost the same words, in Isaiah 51:11. With songs (see the comment on ver. 2). Everlasting joy upon their heads. Anointed, as it were, with \"the oil of gladness\" (Psalm 45:7) forever and ever. Sorrow and sighing shall rise away (comp.

There is an irreconcilable difference between this note of time, in the passage as it stands, and the Assyrian inscriptions. The fourteenth year of Hezekiah was B.C. 714 or 713. Sargon was then King of Assyria, and continued king till B.C. 705. Sennacherib did not ascend the throne till that year, and he did not lead an expedition into Palestine till B.C. 701. Thus the date, as it stands, is cloven or twelve years too early. It is now the common opinion of critics that the chronology of the Books of Kings, speaking generally, is \"a later addition to the Hebrew narrative\" (Cheyne, 'Isaiah,' vol. 1. p. 199, note 1). It is uncertain when the dates were added; but it would not be long from the time when the addition was made before \"Isaiah\" would be brought into accord with \"Kings.\" Another view is that the date belongs to the original writings, but that it has suffered corruption, \"fourteenth\" having been substituted for \"twenty-sixth,\" from an overstrict rendering of the expression, \"in those days,\" which introduces the narrative of ch. 38. That narrative undoubtedly belongs to Hezekiah's fourteenth year. A third view is that of Dr. Hincks, who suggests a derangement of the text, which has attached to an expedition of Sennacherib a date originally belonging to an attack by Sargon. He supposes the original text to have run thus: \"And it came to pass in the fourteenth year of King Hezekiah that the King of Assyria came up (against him). In those days was King Hezekiah sick unto death, etc. (ch. 38, 39.). And Sennacherib, King of Assyria, came up against all the defenced cities of Judah, and took them,\" etc. (ch. 36, 37.). The subject has been treated at considerable length by Mr. Cheyne ('Prophecies of Isaiah,' vol. 1. pp. 196-204), who has accidentally ascribed to Sir H. Rawlinson the second of the above theories, which really originated with the present writer. Sennacherib, King of Assyria. The Hebrew rendering of the name is Sankherib, the Greek Sanacharibus or Senacheribus. In the Assyrian the literation is Sin-akhi-irib - and the meaning\" Sin (the moon-god) multiplies brothers.\" Sin-akhi-irib was the son and successor of Sargon. His father was murdered, and he ascended the throne in B.C. 705 (G. Smith, 'Epunym Canon,' p. 67). Came up against all the defenced cities; rather, all the fenced cities, as in 2 Kings 18:13,or \"all the fortified cities\" (Cheyne). And took them. Sennacberib tells us that, in the campaign of his fourth year ( B.C. 701), he \"captured forty-six of the strong cities\" belonging to Hezekiah, King of Judah, while of the \"fortresses and small cities\" he took \"a countless number\" ('Eponym Canon,' p. 134). (On the causes of the war and its general course, see the Introduction to the book.)NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah36:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the king of Assyria sent Rabshakeh from Lachish to Jerusalem unto king Hezekiah with a great army. And he stood by the conduit of the upper pool in the highway of the fuller's field.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 2. - And the King of Assyria sent Rabshakeh... with a great army (comp. 2 Kings 18:13-17, where we find sufficient ground for believing that this expedition is entirely distinct from that of ver. 1, which was conducted by Sennacherib in person, and led to Hezekiah's submission and the payment of a large tribute). It is inconceivable that, immediately after the grant of terms of peace and their acceptance, Sennacherib should have renewed the war; there must have been an interval, and a fresh provocation. The interval can have been only a short one, since Hezekiah died in B.C. 697. It may have been a couple of years, or perhaps no more than a year, or possibly only a few months. The fresh provocation probably consisted in an application for aid, made by Hezekiah to Tir-hakah, or to the subordinate Egyptian kings, which is glanced at in ver. 6. The Assyrian annals, which never record any reverse or defeat, are wholly silent as to this second expedition. The only profane confirmation of it is to be found in Herodotus (2:141). From Lackish. Laehish, an ancient city of the Amorites (Joshua 10:5), was assigned by Joshua to the tribe of Judah (Joshua 15:39), and seems to have been still a Jewish possession (2 Kings 14:19). It occupied \"a low round swell or knoll\" in the Shefelch, or low tract between the Judaean highland and the Mediterranean, and lay near, if not directly on, the direct route which armies commonly followed in their march from Syria into Egypt. The site is now known as Um-Lakis; it lies between Gaza and Ajlan (Eglon), about two miles west of the hitter. Sennacherib represents himself as engaged in its siege on a bas-relief in the British Museum (see Layard, 'Monuments of Nineveh,\" second series, pl. 21). The conduit of the upper pool (see the comment on ch. 7:3). The spot was that at which Isaiah had been commanded to meet Ahaz some forty years previously. It was probably on the north side of Jerusalem, not tar from the Damascus gate.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah36:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen came forth unto him Eliakim, Hilkiah's son, which was over the house, and Shebna the scribe, and Joah, Asaph's son, the recorder.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 3. - Eliakim: Hilkiah's son (see above, Isaiah 22:20). Eliakim had now taken the place of the Shebna who was \"over the house\" when Isaiah prophesied his downfall (Isaiah 22:19) and Eliakim's advancement (Isaiah 22:21-23). Shebna the scribe. It is not quite certain that this is the same \"Shebna\" as the former prefect of the palace, but the uncommonness of the name is a strong argument for the identity. The post of \"scribe\" or \"secretary \"(marginal rendering) was one of some importance (see 1 Kings 4:3), though inferior to that of palace prefect. Joah... the recorder (comp. 2 Kings 18:18, where the same three officials are mentioned in the same order). We learn from Kings that Sennacherib sent in reality three envoys (2 Kings 18:17) to Hezekiah - the Tartan, or \"commander-in-chief;\" the Rabsaris, or \"chief eunuch;\" and the Rabshakeh, or \"rab-sak,\" the \"chief captain,\" the second in command after the tartan. Hezekiah thought it right to appoint an equal number of officials to meet and confer with them.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah36:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Rabshakeh said unto them, Say ye now to Hezekiah, Thus saith the great king, the king of Assyria, What confidence is this wherein thou trustest?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 4. - And Rabshakeh said. Of the three Assyrian envoys Rabshakeh alone obtains mention in Isaiah, probably because he was the spokesman (comp. 2 Kings 18:19, 26, 27, 37; 2 Kings 19:4). He was probably chosen for spokesman because he could speak Hebrew fluently (infra, vers. 11, 13). The great king. \"The great king\" (sarru rabbu) is the most common title assumed by the Assyrian monarchs in their inscriptions. It is found as early as B.C. 1120.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah36:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTI say, sayest thou, (but they are but vain words) I have counsel and strength for war: now on whom dost thou trust, that thou rebellest against me?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 5. - I say. In 2 Kings 18:20 we read, \"Thou sayest\" for \"I say,\" which gives a better sense. Dr. Kay holds the two forms to be \"complementary.\" I have counsel and strength for war. Either the words of Hezekiah had been reported to Sennacherib, or he rightly divined Hezekiah's thoughts. It was, no doubt, in reliance on the \"counsel\" of Eliakim and the \"strength\" of Egypt that the Jewish monarch had a second time provoked his suzerain.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah36:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTLo, thou trustest in the staff of this broken reed, on Egypt; whereon if a man lean, it will go into his hand, and pierce it: so is Pharaoh king of Egypt to all that trust in him.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 6. - This broken reed; rather, as in 2 Kings 18:21, this bruised reed (comp. Isaiah 42:3). A reed may be \"bruised,\" and wholly untrustworthy as a support, while it appears sound. A \"broken\" reed no one would lean on. Egypt. There had been times when Egypt was a strong power, feared and respected by her neighbours, and a terror even to Assyria. But these times were long past. For the last fifty years the country had been divided against itself (see the comment on Isaiah 19:2), split up into a number of petty principalities, Recently the neighbouring kingdom of Ethiopia had claimed and exercised a species of sovereignty over the entire Nile valley, while allowing tributary princes to govern different portions of it. Of these princes the most important at the time of Rabshakeh's embassy seems to have been Shabatok, who reigned in Memphis, probably from B.C. 712 to B.C. 698. Egypt is likened to a \"bruised reed\" on account of her untrustworthincss. \"So\" (Sabaco) had given no substantial help to Hashes. Shabatok was little likely to imperil himself in order to assist Hezekiah. Even Tirhakah would probably avoid, as long as he could, a conflict with the full power of Assyria. Pharaoh, King of Egypt. Sennacherib uses the generic term, \"Pharaoh,\" instead of mentioning any of the petty princes by name, because he means to speak generally. The King of Egypt, under present circumstances, whoever he may be, is no better than a bruised reed. In his own inscriptions, Sennacherib about this time uses the expression, \"the kings of Egypt\" ('Eponym Canon,' p. 133, 1.47).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah36:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut if thou say to me, We trust in the LORD our God: is it not he, whose high places and whose altars Hezekiah hath taken away, and said to Judah and to Jerusalem, Ye shall worship before this altar?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 7. - If thou say to me, We trust in the Lord. \"The Assyrians,\" it has been observed, \"had a good intelligence department\" (Cheyne). It was known to Sennacherib that Hezekiah had a confident trust, which seemed to him wholly irrational, in Jehovah - the special God of his people. It was also known to him that Hezekiah, in the earlier portion of his reign (2 Kings 18:4), had \"removed the high places\" and broken down the altars, where Jehovah had for centuries been worshipped throughout the length and breadth of the land. He concludes that, in so doing, he must have offended Jehovah. He is probably ignorant of the peculiar proviso of the Jewish Law, that sacrifice should be offered in one place only, and conceives that Hezekiah has been actuated by some narrow motive, and has acted in the interests of one city only, not of the whole people. Ye shall worship before this altar. The parallel passage of 2 Kings (2 Kings 18:22) has \"this altar in Jerusalem.\" The brazen altar in the great court of the temple is, of course, meant. Hezekiah had cleansed it front the pollutions of the time of Ahaz (2 Chronicles 29:18), and had insisted on sacrifice being offered nowhere else (2 Chronicles 29:21-35; 2 Chronicles 30:15-24; 2 Chronicles 31:1, etc.). Such a concentration of worship was unknown to any of the heathen nations, and may well have been unintelligible to them.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah36:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTNow therefore give pledges, I pray thee, to my master the king of Assyria, and I will give thee two thousand horses, if thou be able on thy part to set riders upon them.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 8. - Now therefore give pledges; i.e. \"bind yourselves under s-me penalty.\" Rabshakeh here interrupts his message' to introduce an offer of his own. Intent on ridiculing the absurdity of Hezekiah's resistance of Assyria, he promises to make him a present of two thousand horses, if he (Hezekiah) can find two thousand trained riders to mount them. It is quite likely that he was safe in making this promise, and that, notwithstanding the abundant use of chariots and horses by the Jews of the time for purposes of luxury (Isaiah 2:7), they were destitute of a cavalry force and unaccustomed to the management of war-horses.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah36:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHow then wilt thou turn away the face of one captain of the least of my master's servants, and put thy trust on Egypt for chariots and for horsemen?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 9. - How then wilt thou turn away the face, etc.? i.e. \"How wilt thou be able to defeat, and cause to retreat, a single Assyrian captain at the head of his squadron?\" And put thy trust on Egypt for chariots and for horsemen; rather, but thou trustest in Egypt for chariots and for horsemen. Consciousness of the weakness, with which Rabshakeh had just reproached them, had led to their application to Egypt for a chariot and a cavalry force. Egypt was well able to furnish both, and had sent a large force of both to the help of Ekron a short time previously ('Eponym Canon,' p. 133, 11. 48-56). That force had, however, suffered defeat at the hands of Sennacherib.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah36:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd am I now come up without the LORD against this land to destroy it? the LORD said unto me, Go up against this land, and destroy it.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 10. - The Lord said unto me, Go up against this land, and destroy it; literally, Jehovah said unto me, Go up, etc. (camp. 2 Chronicles 35:21, where Necho tells Josiah that \"God commanded\" his expedition against Carchemish). The heathen monarchs frequently represented themselves as directed to make war on a nation by God, or by some particular god. Piankhi Mer-amman says, \"I am born of the loins. created from the egg, of the Deity... I have not acted without his knowing; he ordained that I should act\" ('Records of the Past,' vol. 2. p. 91). Mesha, King of Moab, declares, \"Chemosh said to me, Go and take Nebo [in war] against Israel\" (ibid., vol. 11. p. 166). Asshur is generally represented as commanding the expeditions of the Assyrian kings (ibid., vol. 1. pp. 21, 48, 60, etc.). Still, it is surprising that Sennacherib should mention \"Jehovah\" as the God from whom he had received the order to attack Hezekiah, and we may suspect that the term which he actually employed was Ilu, \"God,\" and that either Rahshakeh, or the reporter of the speech, substituted \"Jehovah\" as more intelligible to the Jews.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah36:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen said Eliakim and Shebna and Joah unto Rabshakeh, Speak, I pray thee, unto thy servants in the Syrian language; for we understand it: and speak not to us in the Jews' language, in the ears of the people that are on the wall.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 11. - Speak... unto thy servants in the Syrian language; literally, in the Aramaic language. Aramaeans were widely spread over the entire region between the Lower Tigris and the Mediterranean; and their language seems to have been in general use, as a language of commerce. \"Private contract tablets in Aramaic and Assyrian have been found in the remains of ancient Nineveh\" (Cheyne). Rabshakeh had, perhaps, spoken \"in the Jews' language \" without any ill intent, thinking that it was the only tongue which Jewish envoys would understand; but his so doing was calculated to affect the minds of the common people, and to shake their allegiance to Hezekiah. The envoys, therefore, requested him to employ a foreign tongue, and suggested Aramaic as one which was familiar to them, and which they supposed that he would understand. His employment of Hebrew had shown them that he was a linguist. In the Jews' language. There was no language peculiar to the Jews as Jews, that is to say, different from the ordinary speech of the Israelites. Both alike spoke Hebrew. In the Old Testament, however, this corn-men language is never called \"Hebrew,\" but either \"the tongue of Canaan\" (Isaiah 19:18) or \"the Jewish language\" (2 Kings 18:26, 28; 2 Chronicles 32:18; Nehemiah 13:24). Similarly, our own tongue is called \"English,\" though spoken also in Scotland, Wales, Ireland, America, and Australia. In the ears of the people that are on the wall; i.e. of the soldiers placed on the wall to defend it. We must suppose that the conference took place immediately outside the fortifications, so that some of those on the wall could hear.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah36:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut Rabshakeh said, Hath my master sent me to thy master and to thee to speak these words? hath he not sent me to the men that sit upon the wall, that they may eat their own dung, and drink their own piss with you?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 12. - Hath he not sent me to the men that sit upon the wall? Rabshakeh was contravening all diplomatic usage, and no doubt was conscious of it. But the pride and arrogance of the Assyrians rendered them as careless of diplomatic etiquette as, at a later date, were the Romans (see Polybius, 29:11, § 6; Liv., 45:12). That they may eat, etc.; rather, to eat. That is, with no other result than that of being reduced, together with you, to the last extremity of famine, when the siege comes.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah36:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen Rabshakeh stood, and cried with a loud voice in the Jews' language, and said, Hear ye the words of the great king, the king of Assyria.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 13. - Then Rabshakeh stood; i.e. \"rose from a sitting or reclining posture\" - to attract attention, and the better to make himself heard. He continued his speech in Hebrew, and at the same time purposely raised his voice to a loud pitch. The envoys would have been justified in ordering the archers to shoot him from the wall. But they seem to have been struck of a heap, as Epiphanes was by the audacity of Popillius (see the comment on the preceding verse).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah36:14VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThus saith the king, Let not Hezekiah deceive you: for he shall not be able to deliver you.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 14. - Thus saith the king. It is scarcely probable that Sennacherib had expressly empowered Rabshakeh to make a speech to the Jewish people, much less that he had dictated its words. But the envoy regards himself as having plenary powers to declare the king's mind. Let not Hezekiah deceive you. By vain hopes of resisting the Assyrian arms successfully (comp. vers. 5-7).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah36:15VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTNeither let Hezekiah make you trust in the LORD, saying, The LORD will surely deliver us: this city shall not be delivered into the hand of the king of Assyria.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 15. - Neither let Hezekiah make you trust in Jehovah. There is nothing improbable in Rabshakeh's having thus spoken. Isaiah had long been encouraging Hezekiah to resist Sennacherib by promises of Divine aid (Isaiah 30:31; Isaiah 31:4-9). Hezekiah would naturally repeat these premises to the people, and could not give their effect in simpler words than by saying, \"Jehovah will surely deliver us: this city shall not be delivered into the hand of the King of Assyria.\" Spies and deserters would naturally tell the Assyrian envoys what he had said.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah36:16VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHearken not to Hezekiah: for thus saith the king of Assyria, Make an agreement with me by a present, and come out to me: and eat ye every one of his vine, and every one of his fig tree, and drink ye every one the waters of his own cistern;VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 16. - Make an agreement with me by a present; literally, make a blessing with me. Delitzsch paraphrases, \"Enter into a connection of mutual good wishes with me.\" Vance Smith translates boldly, \"Make peace with me;\" and Mr. Cheyne, \"Make a treaty with me.\" There seems to be no doubt that b'rakah, besides its primary sense of \"blessing,\" had two secondary senses, \"present\" and \"treaty.\" Here \"treaty\" is no doubt intended. Come out to me; i.e. \"come out of Jerusalem, and surrender yourselves\" (comp 1 Samuel 11:3; Jeremiah 38:17). And eat ye... drink ye. Peace being made, the Jews could leave the protection of their walled cities, and disperse themselves over their lands, where they could live in plenty and security (comp. 1 Kings 4:25), at any rate for a time. They would be safe front the terrible extremities hinted at in ver. 12, and might confidently await the great king's ultimate disposal of them, which would be determined widen the war in these parts was over. The waters of his own cistern; rather, of his own well. All cultivators had wells in their plots of ground. Cisterns, or reservoirs, in which the rain-water was stored, were comparatively uncommon.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah36:17VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTUntil I come and take you away to a land like your own land, a land of corn and wine, a land of bread and vineyards.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 17. - Until I come and take you away. It was so much thee usual policy of Assyria to remove to a new locality a conquered people, which had given them trouble, that Rabshakeh felt safe in assuming that the fate in store for the Jews, if they submitted themselves, was a transplantation. Sargon had transported the Israelites to Gozan and Media (2 Kings 18:11), the Tibarcni to Assyria, the Commageni to Susiana ('Ancient Monarchies,' vol. 2. p. 423). Sennacherib himself had transported into Assyria more than two hundred thousand Aramaeans (ibid., p. 430). It might be confidently predicted that, if he conquered them, he would transplant the Jews. Rabshakeh tries to soften down the hardship of the lot before them by promises of a removal to a land equal in all respects to Palestine. To a land like your own land. This was certainly not a general principle of Assyrian administration. Nations were removed from the far north to the extreme south, and vice versa, from arid to marshy tracts, from fertile regions to comparative deserts. The security of the empire, not the gratification of the transported slaves, was the ruling and guiding principle of all such changes. A land of corn and wine, a land of bread and vineyards. The writer of Kings adds, \"a land of oil olive and of honey.\" (On the productiveness of Palestine, see Numbers 13:27; Numbers 14:7; Deuteronomy 1:23; Deuteronomy 8:7-9; Deuteronomy 11:11, 12.)NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah36:18VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBeware lest Hezekiah persuade you, saying, The LORD will deliver us. Hath any of the gods of the nations delivered his land out of the hand of the king of Assyria?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 18. - Beware lest Hezekiah persuade you; rather, seduce you (comp. Deuteronomy 13:6; 1 Kings 21:25). Sennacherib claims to be entitled to the people's allegiance, and represents Hezekiah as a rebel, who seeks to draw them away from their duty. Hath any of the gods of the nations delivered his land? The successes of the Assyrians, and the religious character of their wars, justified this boast. The pervading idea of the inscriptions is that wars arc undertaken for the glory of the Assyrian deities, particularly of Asshur, for the chastisement of his enemies, and with the object of establishing in each country, as it is brought under subjection, the laws and worship of Asshur (see 'Ancient Monarchies,' vol. 2. pp. 322-324 and 531). The nations fight under the protection of their own gods, and thus each war is a struggle between the Assyrian deities and those of the nation with which they arc contending. Hitherto, undoubtedly, Assyria had met with almost uniform success (see Isaiah 10:5-14).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah36:19VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWhere are the gods of Hamath and Arphad? where are the gods of Sepharvaim? and have they delivered Samaria out of my hand?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 19. - Where are the gods of Hamath? (comp. Isaiah 10:9). Sargon had reduced Hamath in his third year, B.C. 720. He had \"swept the whole land of Hamath to its extreme limit,\" taken the king prisoner, and carried him away captive to Assyria, where he flayed and burned him; removed most of the inhabitants, and replaced them by Assyrians; plundered the city of its chief treasures, and placed an Assyrian governor over it (see 'Eponym Canon,' pp. 126-128). Among the treasures taken were, no doubt, the images of the Hamathite gods, which were uniformly carried off by the Assyrians from a conquered city. And Arphad. Arphad, or Arpad (Isaiah 10:9), had joined with Hamath in the war against Assyria, and was taken by Sargon in the same year ('Eponym Canon,' p. 127). Of Sepharvaim. Scpharvaim, or Sippara, was besieged and captured by Sargon in his twelfth year, B.C. 710. A severe example was made of the inhabitants (G. Smith, 'History of Babylonia,' p. 122). A discovery made by Mr. Hormuzd Rassam, in 1881, is thought to prove that Sippara was situated at Abu-Habbah, between Baghdad and the site of Babylon, about sixteen miles from the former city (see the 'Transactions of the Society of Bibl. Archaeology,' vol. 8. pp. 164, 173). \"Hena\" and \"Ivah,\" joined with Sepharvaim by the author of Kings (2 Kings 18:31), seem to be omitted by Isaiah as unimportant. They are thought to have been towns upon the Euphrates, not very distant from Babylon, and have been identified respectively with Anah and Hit. But the identification is in both cases uncertain. Have they delivered Samaria? Delitzsch and Mr. Cheyne translate, \"How much less have they delivered Samaria?\" Kay, \"Verily have they delivered,\" regarding the sentence as ironical. Sennacherib can see no distinction between the cities where Jehovah was worshipped, and those which acknowledged any other tutelary god. As Samaria fell, why should not Jerusalem fall?NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah36:20VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWho are they among all the gods of these lands, that have delivered their land out of my hand, that the LORD should deliver Jerusalem out of my hand?VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah36:21VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut they held their peace, and answered him not a word: for the king's commandment was, saying, Answer him not.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 21. - They (i.e. the people, as in 2 Kings 18:36) held their peace. Rabshakeh's attempt to shake their fidelity had, at any rate, no manifest effect. For the king's commandment was, saying, Answer him not. Hezekiah can scarcely have anticipated that Rabshakeh would so far depart from ordinary usage as to make a speech to \"the men on the wall.\" But he may have been in the immediate neighbourhood, and, when apprised of the envoy's proceedings, may have sent the order. We are not to suppose that the Jewish king was at a loss for an answer. He did not choose to bandy words with an envoy who had behaved himself so outrageously.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah36:22VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen came Eliakim, the son of Hilkiah, that was over the household, and Shebna the scribe, and Joah, the son of Asaph, the recorder, to Hezekiah with their clothes rent, and told him the words of Rabshakeh.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 22. - With their clothes rent. Garments were \"rent,\" not only as a sign of mourning, but whenever persons were shocked or horrified (see Genesis 37:29; 1 Samuel 4:12; 2 Samuel 1:2; Ezra 9:3; 2 Chronicles 34:19; Matthew 26:65). The Jewish officials meant to mark their horror at Rabshakeh's blasphemies.NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINE","Isa.37":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah37:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd it came to pass, when king Hezekiah heard it, that he rent his clothes, and covered himself with sackcloth, and went into the house of the LORD.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 1. - When King Hezekiah heard it; rather, heard them; i.e. the \"words of Rabshakeh,\" which his officials reported to him. He rent his clothes. He did as they had done (Isaiah 36:22; see the comment on that verse). But he went further, showing a deeper sense of horror and affliction than the officials had shown by being covered with sackcloth (on the combination of the two modes of showing grief or horror, see Genesis 37:34; 2 Samuel 3:31; 1 Kings 21:27; Esther 4:1, etc.). And went into the house of the Lord. The temple was not only a place for offering praise and sacrifice, but also a \"house of prayer\" (infra, Isaiah 56:7; comp. 1 Kings 8:28-30). Hezekiah can, on this occasion, have gone up to the house of the Lord only to pray.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah37:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he sent Eliakim, who was over the household, and Shebna the scribe, and the elders of the priests covered with sackcloth, unto Isaiah the prophet the son of Amoz.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 2. - He sent Eliakim... and Shebna... and the elders of the priests. A dignified embassy, showing how much Isaiah was held in honour (comp. 2 Kings 22:14 and Jeremiah 38:3; and contrast, on the other hand, the rudeness of Ahab in sending a single eunuch to bring Micaiah into his presence, 1 Kings 22:9). The prophets, as representatives of Jehovah, were entitled to respect and observance even from kings.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah37:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd they said unto him, Thus saith Hezekiah, This day is a day of trouble, and of rebuke, and of blasphemy: for the children are come to the birth, and there is not strength to bring forth.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 3. - A day... of rebuke; rather, of reproof, or punishment (comp. Psalm 149:7 and Hosea 5:9). That God should have allowed such an insulting embassy to come and go in safety was a mode of reproving his people, and to some extent punishing them for their sins. Even Hezekiah himself deserved reproof for having so long placed his reliance upon Egypt (Isaiah 20:5, 6; Isaiah 30:1-4; Isaiah 36:6, 9), though now apparently he had turned to Jehovah, and relied on him only (Isaiah 36:7, 15). Blasphemy. So Delitzsch. Mr. Cheyne suggests \"contumely,\" and Dr. Kay \"contempt.\" But the meaning \"blasphemy,\" which Mr. Cheyne confesses to \"suit the context,\" is required in all the other passages where (substantially) the same word occurs (Nehemiah 9:18, 26; Ezekiel 35:12). Hezekiah calls the day one \"of blasphemy,\" on account of Rabshakeh's impious utterances (Isaiah 36:15, 18, 20). The children are come to the birth, etc. This was a proverbial phrase for a time of extreme difficulty (see Hosea 13:13), and is not to be pressed as embodying at all a close analogy. Judah was in sore trouble, and was expecting deliverance. It seemed now as if she would not have strength to go through the crisis, but would perish through weakness.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah37:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTIt may be the LORD thy God will hear the words of Rabshakeh, whom the king of Assyria his master hath sent to reproach the living God, and will reprove the words which the LORD thy God hath heard: wherefore lift up thy prayer for the remnant that is left.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 4. - It may be the Lord... will hear; i.e. \"will notice,\" or \"will punish.\" If Isaiah laid the matter before God, and prayed earnestly, it was possible that God would intervene to save Judah, and punish the blapshemous words uttered. The living God. In opposition to the dead idols of the heathen, which had neither life, nor breath, nor perception (see Psalm 115:4-8; Psalm 135:15-18). The remnant that is left. It is usual to explain this of Judah generally, which still survived, although Israel had been carried away captive. But perhaps the contrast is rather between the numerous Judaean captives who had been taken and conveyed to Assyria by Sennacherib when he took the \"fenced cities\" (Isaiah 36:1), and the portion of the nation which still remained in the land. Sennacherib says, in his annals, that he took \"forty-six\" cities, and carried captive to Assyria above two hundred thousand persons ('Records of the Past,' vol. 1. p. 38).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah37:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTSo the servants of king Hezekiah came to Isaiah.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah37:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Isaiah said unto them, Thus shall ye say unto your master, Thus saith the LORD, Be not afraid of the words that thou hast heard, wherewith the servants of the king of Assyria have blasphemed me.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 6. - The servants of the King of Assyria. Mr. Cheyne translates, \"the minions of the King of Assyria,\" remarking truly that the word used is not the ordinary one for \"servants,\" but \"a disparaging expression.\" Perhaps the best translation would be lackeys.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah37:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBehold, I will send a blast upon him, and he shall hear a rumour, and return to his own land; and I will cause him to fall by the sword in his own land.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 7. - Behold, I will send a blast upon him; rather, I will put a spirit within him; i.e. I will take away from him the spirit of pride and arrogance by which he has been hitherto actuated, and I will infuse into his heart, instead, a spirit of hesitation and fear. He shall hear a rumour; literally, as Delitzsch translates, he shall hear a hearsay; i.e. \"a report,\" or \"tidings.\" It is uncertain what \"tidings\" are intended. Some suppose \"tidings of the movements of Tirhakah;\" others, \"tidings of the destruction of his host;\" a few, \"tidings of an insurrection in some other part of the Assyrian empire.\" This last supposition is wholly gratuitous, since we have no indication, either in Scripture or in the inscriptions, of any such insurrection. The choice lies between the other two, or between one or other of them, and the two combined. The vagueness is owing, not to the time at which the present narrative took shape, but to the fact that a vague promise - quite sufficient for its purpose - was given at first, the filling in of the details being reserved for a later period (see vers. 22-35).

Libnah was a town at no great distance from Lachish (Joshua 10:31; Joshua 15:39-42). It was also near Mareshah (Joshua 15:42-44), and must therefore have belonged to the more southern portion of the Shefeleh, and probably to the eastern region, where the hills sink down into the plain. The exact site is very uncertain, and still remains to be discovered. Sennacherib's object in moving upon Libnah is doubtful; but it would seem, from his monuments, that he had captured Lachish (Layard, 'Nineveh and Babylon,' pp. 149-152), and had gone on to Libnah, as the next stronghold on the way to Egypt.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah37:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he heard say concerning Tirhakah king of Ethiopia, He is come forth to make war with thee. And when he heard it, he sent messengers to Hezekiah, saying,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 9. - Tirhakah, King of Ethopia. Tirhakah is among the most famous of the monarchs belonging to this period. The Greeks called him \"Tearchon,\" the Assyrians \"Tarku\" or \"Tarqu.\" His name, as represented on his own monuments, is \"Tahark\" or \"Tahrak.\" According to the Egyptian remains, he had a reign of at least twenty-six years in Egypt - from B.C. 693 to B.C. 667. He would seem, however, to have been King of Ethiopia, and lord paramount of the lower valley of the Nile, from about B.C. 700, Shabatok for some years ruling Egypt, or a portion of it, as his deputy (Rawlinson, 'Hist. of Ancient Egypt,' vol. 2. p. 450). Hezekiah's negotiations had, it is probable, been with Tirhakah (ch. 19:13; 20:5; 30:1-6). This monarch, having engaged to help him, now put his forces in motion, and began to descend the Nile valley to his relief. His movement rather provoked than alarmed Sennacherib, who, having defeated one Egyptian army in B.C. 701 ('Eponym Canon,' pp. 133, 134), was confident of success against another. He sent messengers. It is not very clear what advantage Sennacherib expected from this second embassy. He had no fresh argument to bring forward, unless it were a suggestion that Hezekiah's God was endeavouring to deceive him. In the main, vers. 10-13 are a mere expansion of Isaiah 36:18-20.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah37:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThus shall ye speak to Hezekiah king of Judah, saying, Let not thy God, in whom thou trustest, deceive thee, saying, Jerusalem shall not be given into the hand of the king of Assyria.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 10. - Let not thy God, in whom thou trustest, deceive thee. Sennacherib recognized Jehovah as a god, the God of the Jews, but put him on a par with the other \"gods of the nations\" (ver. 11), and (lid not believe in his being able to contend with Asshur. If he were really, through his priests or prophets, giving Hezekiah assurances of protection and deliverance, he could only be \"deceiving\" him.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah37:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBehold, thou hast heard what the kings of Assyria have done to all lands by destroying them utterly; and shalt thou be delivered?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 11. - Thou hast heard what the kings of Assyria have done to all lands (compare the Assyrian inscriptions, passim). Tiglath-Pileser I. calls himself \" the conquering hero, the terror of whose name has overwhelmed all regions\" ('Records of the Past,' vol. 5. p. 8); Asshur-izir-pal, \"the king who subdued all the races of men\" (ibid., ch. 7. p. 11); Shalmaneser II., \"the marcher over the whole world\" (ibid., vol. 5. p. 29); Shamas-Vul, \"the trampler on the world\" (ibid., vol. 1:12). Sargon says that \"the gods had granted him the exercise of his sovereignty over all kings\" (ibid., ch. 9. p. 4), and that he \"reigned from the two beginnings to the two ends of the four celestial points\" (ibid., ch. 11. p. 33), i.e. from the furthest north to the furthest south, and from the extreme cast to the extreme west. Sennacherib himself says, \"Aashur, father of the gods, among all kings firmly has raised me, and over all that dwell in the countries he caused to increase my weapons\" (ibid., ch. 11. p. 49). From first to last, in their inscriptions, the monarchs claim a universal dominion.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah37:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHave the gods of the nations delivered them which my fathers have destroyed, as Gozan, and Haran, and Rezeph, and the children of Eden which were in Telassar?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 12. - My fathers. The Assyrian monarchs call all those who have preceded them upon the throne their \"fathers,\" without intending to claim any blood-relation-ship. Sargon, Sennacherib's father, though a usurper and the first king of a new dynasty, frequently speaks of \"the kings his fathers\" ('Records of the Past,' ch. 7. pp. 39, 51, etc.). Gozan... Haran ... Rezeph... Telassar. \"Gozan\" is, beyond all doubt, the region known to the Greeks as Gauzanitis, which was the eastern portion of Upper Mesopotamia, or the country about the sources of the Khabour river. The Assyrian conquest of this tract is indicated by the settlement of the Israelites in the region (2 Kings 17:6; 2 Kings 18:11; 1 Chronicles 5:26). \"Harsh\" is the well-known \"city of Nahor\" (Genesis 24:10), called in Acts 7:2 \"Charran,\" and by the Greeks and Romans, Carrhae. It has now recovered its old designation, and is known as Hurrah. \"Rezeph\" was in the neighborhood of Haran, and is mentioned as belonging to Assyria as early as B.C. 775 ('Eponym Canon,' p. 82). It had probably revolted and been reduced at a later date. \"Telassar,\" \"the Hill of Asshur,\" is not mentioned in the Assyrian inscriptions, but was probably the Assyrian name of a town on or near the Euphrates, in the country of the Bent-Eden, which was not far from Carche-mish (see 'Records of the Past,' ch. 3. pp. 90-92). The children of Eden. The Assyrian inscriptions mention a \"Bit-Adini\" (comp. Amos 1:5), and a chief who is called \"the son of Adini;\" both belonging to the Middle Euphrates region. The \"children of Eden\" (Beni-Eden) were probably the people of the tract about Bit-Adini.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah37:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWhere is the king of Hamath, and the king of Arphad, and the king of the city of Sepharvaim, Hena, and Ivah?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 13. - Hamath...

Sepharvaim (see the comment upon Isaiah 36:19).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah37:14VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Hezekiah received the letter from the hand of the messengers, and read it: and Hezekiah went up unto the house of the LORD, and spread it before the LORD.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 14. - Hezekiah received the letter. Sennacherib sent his present message in a written form. The communications between kings were often carried on in this way (see 2 Kings 5:5; 2 Kings 20:12). The Hebrews use the same word for \"letter\" and \"book;\" but, when a letter is intended, employ generally the plural number (compare the Greek ἐπιστολαὶ and the Latin litterae). And spread it before the Lord. Not that God might see it and read it, in a material sense, but still that he might take note of it, and, if he saw fit, punish it. Compare the exhibition of the Books of the Law, painted with idolatrous emblems, at Maspha, \"over against\" the temple, by Judas Maccabaeus and his companions (1 Macc. 3:46-48). The act in both cases implied the referring of the whole matter to God for his consideration. It was, as Delitzsch, says, a sort of \"prayer without words.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah37:15VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Hezekiah prayed unto the LORD, saying,VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah37:16VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTO LORD of hosts, God of Israel, that dwellest between the cherubims, thou art the God, even thou alone, of all the kingdoms of the earth: thou hast made heaven and earth.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 16. - O Lord... that dwellest between the cherubims; literally, that sittest upon the cherubim. The allusion is scarcely to the poetic imagery of God riding on the cherubim in the heavens (Psalm 18:10), as Mr. Cheyne suggests; but rather to his dwelling between the two cherubic forms in the holy of holies, and there manifesting himself (camp. Numbers 7:89; 1 Samuel 4:4; 2 Samuel 6:2; 1 Chronicles 13:6; Psalm 80:1; Psalm 99:1). Thou art the God, even thou alone, of all the kingdoms of the earth. It has been questioned whether Hezekiah was really as pronounced a monotheist as these expressions would imply, and suggested that his actual words received \"a colouring\" from a later writer. Hezekiah's contemporaries, it is said, Isaiah and Micah, make no such strong statements of their belief in one only God as this (Kuenen, Cheyne). But it is difficult to see what can be a clearer revelation of monotheism than Isaiah 6:1-5, or what truth more absolutely underlies the whole of Isaiah's teaching than the unity of the Supreme Being. The same under-current is observable in Micah (Micah 1:2, 3; Micah 4:5; Micah 6:6-9; Micah 7:17, 18). Sennacherib's belief, that each country has its own god (Isaiah 36:18-20), is not shared by the religious Jews of his time. They are well aware that the heathen gods are \"vanity\" (Isaiah 46:3; Hosea 4:15; Amos 1:5; Jonah 2:8), \"wind\" and \"confusion\" (Isaiah 41:29, etc.). Thou hast made heaven and earth (comp. Genesis 1:1; Psalm 102:25; Isaiah 40:26-28; Isaiah 42:5, etc.).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah37:17VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTIncline thine ear, O LORD, and hear; open thine eyes, O LORD, and see: and hear all the words of Sennacherib, which hath sent to reproach the living God.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 17. - Incline thine ear... open thine eyes. This is a conscious pleading of the promise made to Solomon (2 Chronicles 7:15).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah37:18VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTOf a truth, LORD, the kings of Assyria have laid waste all the nations, and their countries,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 18. - Of a truth, Lord, the kings of Assyria have laid waste all the nations. This was a stubborn fact, which it was impossible to deny. From the time of Asshur-izir-pal at any rate, about B.C. 880, Assyria had pursued for nearly two centuries a steady career of conquest, reducing the nations which were her neighbors, almost without exception, and gradually spreading her power from the tract immediately about Nineveh to the Persian Gulf on the south, the great plateau of Iran on the east, the Armenian Mountains (Niphates and Taurus) on the north, and on the west to Cilicia and the Mediterranean. Her progress towards the west alone is marked in Scripture, since there alone she came in contact with God's people. Under Pul (about B.C. 760) she attacked Samaria (2 Kings 15:19); under Tiglath-Pileser II. she carried off a portion of the ten tribes (2 Kings 15:29); under the same monarch she subjugated Damascus (2 Kings 16:9); under Shalmaneser she besieged (2 Kings 17:5), and under Sargon took, Samaria (2 Kings 17:6); under Sargon also she invaded Philistia and captured Ashdod (ch. 20:1). Now she was bent on subduing Judaea, and so preparing the way for the reduction of Egypt. Humanly speaking, it was most unlikely that the small and weak state of Judaea would be able to resist her. But God was all-powerful, and might be pleased to cast down, as he had been pleased to exalt (Isaiah 10:5-19). Hence Hezekiah's appeal.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah37:19VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd have cast their gods into the fire: for they were no gods, but the work of men's hands, wood and stone: therefore they have destroyed them.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 19. - And have cast their gods into the fire. The more valuable of the foreign idols were usually carried off by the Assyrians, and placed in the shrines of their own gods as trophies of victory; but no doubt great numbers of the inferior idols. which were of wood, not even coated with metal - the ξόανα of the Greeks - were burnt. For they were no gods (temp. Jeremiah 2:11; Jeremiah 5:7; Jeremiah 16:20, etc.). Isaiah's favourite word for \"idols\" is elilim, which is, etymologically, \"not-gods\" (Isaiah 2:8, 18, 20; Isaiah 10:10, 11; Isaiah 19:1, 3; Isaiah 31:7). The work of men's hands (see Isaiah 2:8; Isaiah 40:19; Isaiah 41:7, etc.). The absurdity of men's worshipping as gods what their own hands had made is ever increasingly ridiculed by the religious Jews (comp. Psalm 115:4-8; Isaiah 44:9-20; Jeremiah 10:3-15; 'Ep of Jeremy,' 8-73).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah37:20VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTNow therefore, O LORD our God, save us from his hand, that all the kingdoms of the earth may know that thou art the LORD, even thou only.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 20. - Save us... that all the kingdoms... may know, etc. God's true servants desire deliverance and triumph over enemies, not alone for their own sakes, not even for the sake of the country or people whose fate is bound up with their own, but for the glory of God, that his honour may be vindicated in the sight of the world at large. It is a large part of the satisfaction of Moses at the passage of the Red Sea, that \"the peoples would hear... the dukes of Edom be amazed... the mighty men of Moab tremble,\" etc. (Exodus 15:14, 15). David would have his foes \"consumed\" in order that they might know that \"God ruled in Jacob, and unto the cads of the earth\" (Psalm 59:13), and again, in order \"that men may know that thou, whose Name alone is Jehovah, art the Most High over all the earth\" (Psalm 83:18). It has been well said that \"the object of all the judgments which the true prophet desires is to bring all nations into subjection to God.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah37:21VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen Isaiah the son of Amoz sent unto Hezekiah, saying, Thus saith the LORD God of Israel, Whereas thou hast prayed to me against Sennacherib king of Assyria:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 21. - Then Isaiah... sent to Hezekiah, saying. It seems most natural to understand that the prophet was at once supernaturally informed of Hezekiah's prayer, as Ananias was of Saul's (Acts 9:11), and instructed what reply to make to it. But still, it is no doubt possible that some of the facts have been omitted for the sake of brevity.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah37:22VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThis is the word which the LORD hath spoken concerning him; The virgin, the daughter of Zion, hath despised thee, and laughed thee to scorn; the daughter of Jerusalem hath shaken her head at thee.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 22. - The virgin the daughter of Zion; i.e. Jerusalem (comp. Isaiah 1:8; Isaiah 10:32; Isaiah 16:1; Isaiah 52:2; Isaiah 62:11). The expression, \"virgin daughter,\" is used also by Isaiah of Zidon (Isaiah 23:12) and of Babylon (Isaiah 47:1). The personification here is very effective. since it represents Jerusalem as a tender maiden, weak and delicate, yet still bold enough to stand up against Sennacherib and all his host, and bid him defiance. Confident in Jehovah, her Protector, she despises him, and laughs him to scorn; nay, \"shakes her head at him,\" or rather. \"after him,\" pursuing him with scornful gestures as In. retreats before her. (On shaking the head as a gesture of scorn, see Psalm 22:7; Psalm 109:25; Matthew 27:39.)NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah37:23VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWhom hast thou reproached and blasphemed? and against whom hast thou exalted thy voice, and lifted up thine eyes on high? even against the Holy One of Israel.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 23. - Even against the Holy One of Israel. A specially Isaiah phrase, employed by Isaiah twenty-eight times, and only five times in all the rest of Scripture. A strong proof, if any proof beyond the unmistakable Isaiah spirit of the entire prophecy were needed, of the genuineness of the present passage.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah37:24VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBy thy servants hast thou reproached the Lord, and hast said, By the multitude of my chariots am I come up to the height of the mountains, to the sides of Lebanon; and I will cut down the tall cedars thereof, and the choice fir trees thereof: and I will enter into the height of his border, and the forest of his Carmel.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 24. - By thy servants hast thou reproached the Lord (see Isaiah 36:15-20). And hast said. Sennacherib had not actually uttered these words with his mouth; but the prophet clothes in his own highly poetic language the thoughts which the Assyrian king had cherished in his heart. He had regarded \"the multitude of his chariots\" as irresistible; he had considered that the mountains which guarded Palestine would be no obstacle to his advance; he had contemplated ravaging and despoiling of its timber the entire country; he had meant to penetrate into every region that was lovely and fertile. The emphatic \"I\" of the original - ani - twice repeated, marks the proud egotism of the monarch. By the multitude of my chariots am I come up to the height of the mountains; rather, with the multitude; or, according to another reading, with chariots upon chariots. The Assyrian kings contrived to cross with their chariots mountain chains of great difficulty, and frequently boast of the achievement. Tiglath-Pileser I. says, \"I assembled my chariots and warriors. I betook myself to carts of iron in order to overcome the rough mountains and their difficult marches. I made the wilderness thus practicable for the passage of my chariots and warriors\" ('Records of the Past,' vol. 5. pp. 9, 10). Asshur-izir-pal, \"The rugged hill country, unfitted for the passage of chariots and armies, with instruments of iron I cut through, and with metal rollers I beat down the chariots and troops I brought over\" (ibid., vol. 3. p. 58). Shalmaneser II., \"Trackless paths, difficult mountains, which like the point of an iron sword stood pointed to the sky, on wheels of iron and bronze I penetrated. My chariots and armies I transported over them\" (ibid., p. 85). In the less rough parts, while the warders dismounted, tire horses drew the chariots, which were assisted over obstacles by attendants ('Ancient Monarchies,' vol. 2. p. 74); but, in regions of greater difficulty, they were conveyed across the mountain ranges in waggons of rude and strong construction ('Records of the Past,' vol. 5. p. 13) The chariot-force was regarded as so important that the Assyrians never made any distant expedition without it. To the sides of Lebanon. It was not necessary to cross either Libanus or Anti-Libanus in order to invade Judaea, since the natural route was along the Coele-Syrian valley and across the spurs of Hermon to the Jordan; but an Assyrian army was intent on plunder and devastation, no less than upon conquest, and would ascend mountain regions that did not lie on its direct line of march for either or both of these objects. It was customary for the soldiers to cut clown the tall cedars and choice fir trees of Lebanon on their Syrian campaigns, in order to transport the timber to Nineveh and other great cities, where it was used for building (see the comment on Isaiah 14:8, and compare Layard, 'Nineveh and Babylon,' pp. 356, 357, and 'Records of the Past,' vol. 3. pp. 40, 47, 83, 90; vol. 5. p. 119; vol. 9. p. 16, etc.). It was also customary to destroy the trees in an enemy's country, simply in order to inflict injury upon the foe ('Ancient Monarchies.' vol. 2. p. 84). I will enter into the height of his border; rather, I will enter into its uttermost height; i.e. I will penetrate through the entire mountain region of Palestine, called roughly \"Lebanon,\" to the furthest height of any importance - that on which Jerusalem stood - and thus occupy the whole land. The parallel passage of 2 Kings has \"lodging\" for \"height,\" in apparent allusion to the palace of Hezekiah. And the forest of his Carmel; or, the forest of its pleasure-garden; i.e. the rich plantation tracts, covered with vines, olives, and fig trees, which formed the special glory of Judaea (see Isaiah 36:16, 17).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah37:25VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTI have digged, and drunk water; and with the sole of my feet have I dried up all the rivers of the besieged places.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 25. - I have digged, and drunk water. Sennacherib notes three natural obstacles to his advance - the forces of his opponents he does not appear to account an obstacle - viz. mountains, deserts, rivers. Mountains do not stop him - he crosses them even with his chariot-force (ver. 24). Deserts do not stop him - he digs wells there, and drinks their waters. Rivers will not stop him - he will dry them up, trample them into puddles. Note the contrast between the past tenses, \"I have come up,\" \"I have digged,\" \"I have drunk,\" and the future, \"I will dry up.\" He had crossed the mountain ranges Sinjar, Amanus, Lebanon; he had passed waterless tracts, where he had had to dig wells, in Mesopotamia and Northern Syria. He was about to find his chief obstacle, rivers, when he invaded Lower Egypt. The rivers of the besieged places; rather, the rivers of Egypt. Mazor, the singular form (compare Assyrian Muzr, and modern Arabic Misr), is used here (as in Micah 7:12, and perhaps in Isaiah 19:6), instead of the ordinary dual term, Miz-raim, probably because Lower Egypt is especially intended. Sennacherib was looking especially to the invasion of Lower Egypt,where the Nile had \"seven branches\" (Herod., 2:17), and the country was also cut up by numerous canals, which would naturally constitute a great difficulty to a force depending mainly on its chariots. He believed, however, in his heart, that he would find a way of \"drying up\" these \"rivers.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah37:26VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHast thou not heard long ago, how I have done it; and of ancient times, that I have formed it? now have I brought it to pass, that thou shouldest be to lay waste defenced cities into ruinous heaps.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 26. - Hast thou not heard, etc.? An abrupt transition, such as is common in Isaiah. From speaking in the person of Sennacherib, the prophet without warning breaks off, and returns to speaking in the person of Jehovah, as his mouthpiece. \"Hast thou not heard,\" he says, long ago; or rather, \"that from long ago! have done this?\" Art thou so ignorant, so devoid of that light of nature, which should \"lighten every man that cometh into the world\" (John 1:9), as not to know God's method of governing the world? How that \"from long ago,\" in his eternal counsels, he designs the rise and fall of nations, and the mode in which their destruction is to be brought about? Art thou not aware that conquerors are mere instruments in God's hands - \"the rods of his anger\" (Isaiah 10:5) - to work his will, and then to have his will worked upon them in turn (see Isaiah 10:6-19)? Sennacherib seems to be really reproached for not knowing what he ought to have known, and might have known, if he had listened to the voice of conscience and reason. Now have brought it to pass, etc. All that Sennacherib had done, he had done as God's instrument, by his permission - nay, by his aid. He had been the axe in the hand of the hewer (Isaiah 10:15), the saw, the rod, the staff, of God's indignation (Isaiah 10:5), the executor of his vengeance. The very purpose of his being was that he should \"lay waste (certain) defenced cities into ruinous heaps.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah37:27VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTTherefore their inhabitants were of small power, they were dismayed and confounded: they were as the grass of the field, and as the green herb, as the grass on the housetops, and as corn blasted before it be grown up.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 27. - Therefore. The original is not so emphatic, but still contains the idea, not merely of sequence, but of consequence. God, having decreed the successes of the Assyrians, effected them (in part) by infusing weakness into the nations that were their adversaries. They were as the grass of the field (comp. Isaiah 40:6, 7). The comparison is one constantly used by the Hebrew psalmists (Psalm 37:2; Psalm 90:5; Psalm 92:7; Psalm 103:15), and was not unknown to the Assyrians ('Records of the Past,' vol. 3. p. 41; vol. 5. p. 14). The delicate grass of spring in the East withers within a few weeks, and the fresh and tender herbage becomes yellow, parched, and sapless. The grass that springs upon the earthen roofs of houses fails even more rapidly (comp. Psalm 129:6). As corn blasted before it be grown up; literally, like a field before the stalk. Our translators seem to have rightly preferred the reading of 2 Kings 19:26 (sh'dephah, equivalent to \"blasting\") to that of Isaiah (sh'demah, equivalent to \"field\") in this place. Their rendering brings out the true sense.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah37:28VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut I know thy abode, and thy going out, and thy coming in, and thy rage against me.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 28. - I know thy abode; literally, thy down-sitting (comp. Psalm 139:2). The meaning is that God has, and has had, his eye on Sennacherib throughout all his career, seeing to and watching over his performance of his will. The phrase, going out, and coming in, is a Hebrew idiom for a man's doings (see Numbers 27:17; Deuteronomy 28:6; Deuteronomy 31:2; 1 Samuel 18:13, 16; 2 Samuel 3:25; 1 Kings 3:7, etc.). Thy rage against me. As shown in the message sent by Rab-shakeh (ch. 36:7), in Rabshakeh's speech to the \"men on the wall\" (Isaiah 36:15-20), and in the letter sent to Hezekiah from Lachish (Isaiah 37:10).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah37:29VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBecause thy rage against me, and thy tumult, is come up into mine ears, therefore will I put my hook in thy nose, and my bridle in thy lips, and I will turn thee back by the way by which thou camest.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 29. - Therefore will I put my hook in thy nose (comp. Ezekiel 29:4; Ezekiel 38:4; 2 Chronicles 33:11). The Assyrians were in the habit of passing \"hooks\" or \"rings\" through the noses or lips of their more distinguished prisoners, and attaching a thong to the hook or ring, by which they led the prisoners into the royal presence ('Ancient Monarchies,' vol. 1. p. 304; vol. 3. p. 436). The expressions used derive their force from these practices, but are not in the present place to be understood literally. God \"turned Sennacherib back\" and reconducted him to Nineveh. not with an actual \"hook\" or \"thong,\" but by the \"bridle\" of necessity.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah37:30VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd this shall be a sign unto thee, Ye shall eat this year such as groweth of itself; and the second year that which springeth of the same: and in the third year sow ye, and reap, and plant vineyards, and eat the fruit thereof.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 30. - This shall be a sign unto thee; rather, the sign. The prophet now turns to Hezekiah, and makes an address to him. \"This,\" he says, \"shall be the sign unto thee of Sennachcrib's being effectually 'bridled,' and the danger from Assyria over. In the third year from the present the land shall have returned to its normal condition, and you shall enjoy its fruits as formerly. Meanwhile you shall obtain sufficient nourishment from the grain which has sown itself.\" The \"third year,\" according to Hebrew reckoning, might be little more than one year from the date of the delivery of the prophecy. The entire withdrawal of all the Assyrian garrisons from the country, which no doubt followed on Sennacherib's retreat, might well have occupied the greater part of a year. Till they were withdrawn, the Jews could not venture to till their territory. Plant vineyards. The Assyrians had, no doubt, cut down the vines (see 'Records of the Past,' vol. 3. pp. 40, 62, 79; vol. 7. p. 43, etc.; Layard, 'Monuments of Nineveh,' second series, pl. 40).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah37:31VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the remnant that is escaped of the house of Judah shall again take root downward, and bear fruit upward:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 31. - The remnant that is escaped (see the comment on ver. 4). Take root downward, and bear fruit upward; i.e. \"spread over the land, and became firmly rooted in it, and flourish as in the former time.\" We must conceive of the Assyrians having, in their two recent invasions, completely depopulated the country districts. Numbers had, no doubt, been slain; more than two hundred thousand had been carried into captivity; a portion had found refuge in the capital On the withdrawal of the Assyrians, these last \"went forth,\" reoccupied their lands, and rebuilt their towns and villages. The blessing of God was upon them, and in a short time Judaea recovered her ancient vigour, so that, under Josiah, she was able to extend her dominion over almost the whole of the old Israelite territory (2 Chronicles 34:6, 18).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah37:32VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor out of Jerusalem shall go forth a remnant, and they that escape out of mount Zion: the zeal of the LORD of hosts shall do this.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 32. - The zeal, etc. (comp.

The phrase is very emphatic, marking the greatness of the thing to be done, and at the same time bringing the strophe to an end with an asseveration beyond which nothing could go.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah37:33VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTTherefore thus saith the LORD concerning the king of Assyria, He shall not come into this city, nor shoot an arrow there, nor come before it with shields, nor cast a bank against it.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 33. - Therefore, etc. A new clause is commenced - the concluding clause of the prophecy. For Hezekiah's satisfaction and consolation something more definite is needed than the vague assurances that \"the daughter of Jerusalem shook her head at Sennacherib\" (ver. 22), and that God would \"put a bridle in Sennacherib's mouth\" (ver. 29). Accordingly, it is now declared, in the plainest terms, that he shall not even lay siege to the city, but shall return by the way by which he came - the coast route - leaving Jerusalem untouched, nay, unattempted. He shall not come into this city; rather, unto the city. He was at Libnah, in the Shefeleh, thirty or forty miles from Jerusalem, when we last heard of him (ver. 8); and, having then been just informed of the advance of Tirhakah, he is likely to have proceeded on towards Egypt. There is, at any rate, not the slightest intimation of his having made a retrograde movement towards the Jewish capital. Nor shoot an arrow there, nor come before it with shields, nor cast a bank against it. The main points of an Assyrian siege are happily seized. The first assailants were the archers. They boldly approached in large bodies, and strove to clear the battlements of the defenders. Then shields were brought into play. Under their cover the archers drew nearer; the scaling parties brought up their ladders; the miners attacked the foundations of the walls; and the torch-bearers endeavoured to fire the gates. Finally, if these tactics did not avail, banks were raised against the walls, which were then assailed with battering-rams till they were breached and the assailants could cuter. God promises that Jerusalem shall experience none of these things at Sennacherib's hands.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah37:34VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBy the way that he came, by the same shall he return, and shall not come into this city, saith the LORD.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 34. - By the way that he came. It is clear that Sennacherib on this occasion had marched by the usual coast route, through Sharon and the Shefeleh, upon Lachish, leaving Jerusalem far to his left. From Laehish he sent Rabshakeh to Hezekiah with a threatening message, and (as our version has it) \"with a great army;\" rather, \"with a strong force.\" Rabshakeh, having delivered his message, returned to his master (Isaiah 37:8), doubtless with his escort. Sennacherib then sent a letter by messengers, but without an army, so far as we are told, to renew his threats. Meanwhile from Lachish he went to Libnah, after which we know nothing of his movements, unless we accept the Egyptian account, which was, that he advanced to Pelusium. The declaration, \"By the way that he came, by the same shall he return\" (comp. ver. 29) was the most comforting that Hezekiah could possibly receive. It assured him that he would not even be confronted with his enemy. Into this city; rather, unto this city (as in ver. 32).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah37:35VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor I will defend this city to save it for mine own sake, and for my servant David's sake.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 35. - I will defend this city... for mine own sake; literally, I will cover over this city, as a bird covers its young with its wings (comp. Isaiah 31:5; Matthew 23:37). God would do this \"for his own sake;\" i.e. because his own honour was concerned in the defence of his people. He would also do it for his servant David's sake; i.e. because of the promises made to David, that his children should sit upon his throne (2 Samuel 7:16; Psalm 89:29-37; Psalm 132:11-14, etc.), which involved the continued independence of Judaea and Jerusalem.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah37:36VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen the angel of the LORD went forth, and smote in the camp of the Assyrians a hundred and fourscore and five thousand: and when they arose early in the morning, behold, they were all dead corpses.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 36. - Then the angel of the Lord went forth. The parallel passage of Kings (2 Kings 19:35) has, \"It came to pass that night, that the angel of the Lord went out.\" The word of Isaiah had its accomplishment within a few hours. On the camp of the Assyrians, wherever it was, whether at Libnah, or at Pelusium (Herod., 2:141), or between the two, in the dead of night, the destroying angel swooped down, and silently, without disturbance, took the lives of a hundred and eighty-five thousand' men. The camp was no doubt that in which Sennacherib commanded. It is contrary to the whole tenor of the Assyrian inscriptions to imagine that a mere corps d'armee, detached to threaten, not to besiege, Jerusalem, could have been one-half, or one-quarter, so numerous. It was Sennacherib's host, not the Tartan's, that was visited. So the Egyptian tradition; so ver. 37, by implication. That in later times the Jews should have transferred the scene of the slaughter to the vicinity of their own capital, as Josephus does ('Ant. Jud.,' 10:2. § 5), is not surprising, especially as the Egyptians claimed the glory of the discomfiture for their own gods, and the completion of the victory for their own soldiers. The nature of the destruction is not, perhaps, very important, if it be allowed to have been supernatural; but the \"simoom\" of Prideaux and Milman, the \"storm\" of Vitringa and Stanley, the \"nocturnal attack by Tirhakah\" of Usher, Preiss, and Michaelis, and the \"pestilence\" of most other commentators, seem to be alike precluded by the terms of the narrative, which imply the silent death in one night of a hundred and eighty-five thousand persons by what English juries call \"the visitation of God.\" The nearest parallel which Holy Scripture offers is the destruction of the firstborn in Egypt; but that was not, as this, without disturbance (see Exodus 12:30). There a \"great cry\" broke the silence of the night; here it was not till morning, when men woke from their peaceful slumbers, that the discovery was made that \"they were all dead corpses.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah37:37VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTSo Sennacherib king of Assyria departed, and went and returned, and dwelt at Nineveh.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 37. - So Sennacherib... departed; rather, broke up his camp. The word used for all the removals of the children of Israel in the wilderness (Numbers 33:3-48). The loss of even an entire corps d'armeee would not have caused an Assyrian king, at the head of an intact main army, to break up his camp and abandon his enterprise. And dwelt at Nineveh. Sennacherib lived some eighteen or twenty years from the probable date of his discomfiture, dying in B.C. 681. His ordinary residence was at Nineveh, which he greatly adorned and beautified ('Records of the Past,' vol. 11. pp. 55-57). His father, Sargon, on the contrary, dwelt commonly at Khorsabad (Dur-Sargina), and his son, Esarhaddon, dwelt, during the latter part of his reign, at Babylon. We must not suppose, however, that Sennacherib was shut up in Nineveh during the remainder of his life. On the contrary, he made frequent expeditions towards the south, the east, and the north. But he made no farther expedition to the south-west, no further attack on Jerusalem, or attempt on Egypt. The Jews had peace, so far as the Assyrians were concerned, from the event related in ver. 36 to a late date in the reign of Esarhaddon.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah37:38VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd it came to pass, as he was worshipping in the house of Nisroch his god, that Adrammelech and Sharezer his sons smote him with the sword; and they escaped into the land of Armenia: and Esarhaddon his son reigned in his stead.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 38. - Nisroch his god. The name Nisroch has not been found in the Assyrian inscriptions, and is, in fact, read only in this place and the parallel passage of Kings (2 Kings 19:37). It has been supposed to represent Nusku, an Assyrian god of a somewhat low position, who, however, does not obtain mention in the historical inscriptions until the time of Asshur-bani-pal. Probably the name has suffered corruption. Asshur was, in fact, Sennacherib's favourite deity, and it is remarkable that the LXX. give in this place, not Nisroch, but Asarach. \"Asarach\" would seem to be \"Asshur\" with a guttural suffix. Adrammelech and Sharezer his sons smote him. The murder of Sennacherib by a son, whom he called \"Ardumazanes,\" was related by Polyhistor (ap. Euseb., 'Chronicles Can.,' 1:5, § l). Esar-haddon's annals are imperfect at the commencement, but show that his authority was at first contested, and that he had to establish it by force of arms ('Records of the Past,' vol. 3. pp. 103, 104). Adrammelech seems to have assumed the title of king (Abyden. up. Euscb., 'Chronicles Can.,' 1:9, § 1), and to have been put to death by his brother. Sharezer is not elsewhere mentioned. The name is Assyrian, as far as it goes, but is incomplete. Its full form was probably Nabu-sar-uzur or Nergal-sar-uzur (see 'Eponym Canon,' p. 63, B.C. 682 and 678). And escaped into the land of Armenia. So Moses of Chorene ('Hist. Armen.,' 1:22). The Hebrew word is Ararat (Assyrian Urardu or Urartu), which was the more eastern portion of Armenia, and lay beyond the sphere of Assyrian influence. Esarhaddon his son reigned in his stead. Esarhaddon (Asshur-akh iddiua) appears to have ascended the throne in B.C. 681. It is highly improbable that Isaiah was then living, and therefore the verse can scarcely be from his pen. It has probably been transferred from 2 Kings (2 Kings 19:37) in order to finish off the narrative. Esarhaddon outlived Hezekiah many years, and was brought into contact with Manasseh ('Eponym Canon,' p. 139), whom he reckoned among his tributaries (comp. 2 Chronicles 33:11).NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINE","Isa.38":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah38:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTIn those days was Hezekiah sick unto death.

The illness of Hezekiah is fixed by ver. 5 (and 2 Kings 20:6) to the fourteenth year of his reign, or B.C. 714. The entire narrative of this chapter and the next is therefore thirteen or fourteen years earlier than that of ch. 36, 37, which belongs to Hezekiah's closing years, B.C. 701-698 (see the comment on Isaiah 26:l, 2). Sick unto death; i.e. attacked by a malady which, if it had run its natural course, would have been fatal. Isaiah the prophet the son of Amoz. This double designation of Isaiah, by his office and by his descent, marks the original independence of this narrative, which was not intended for a continuation of ch. 37. Thou shalt die, and not live. Prophecies were often threats, and, when such, were conditional, announcing results which would follow unless averted by prayer or repentance (compare Jonah's prophecy, \"Yet forty days, and Nineveh shall be overthrown,\" Jonah 3:4).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah38:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen Hezekiah turned his face toward the wall, and prayed unto the LORD,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 2. - Hezekiah turned his face toward the wall.

And Hezekiah wept sore.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 3. - Remember now, O Lord. Hezekiah was in the full vigour of life - thirty-nine years old only. He had probably as yet no son, since Manasseh, who succeeded him, was but twelve (2 Kings 21:1, 2 Chronicles 33:1) when Hezekiah died at the age of fifty-four. It was a grievous thing to a Jew to leave no male offspring: it was viewed as a mark of the Divine displeasure to be cut off in the midst of one's days (Job 15:32; Job 22:15, 16: Psalm 55:23; Proverbs 10:27; Ecclesiastes 7:17). Hezekiah asked himself - Had he deserved such a sentence? He thought that he had not. He knew that, with whatever shortcomings, he had endeavoured to serve God, had trusted in him (2 Kings 18:5), cleaved to him (2 Kings 18:6), \"departed not from following him, but kept his commandments\" (2 Kings 18:6) He therefore ventured upon an expostulation and an earnest prayer; and God was pleased to hear the prayer and to grant it. I have walked before thee in truth and with a perfect heart. Compare the unbiased testimony of the authors of Kings and Chronicles (2 Kings 18:3-6; 2 Chronicles 29:2; 2 Chronicles 31:20, 21). Under the old dispensation, there was nothing to prevent men from pleading their righteousness before God (comp. Job 31:4-40; Psalm 7:3-2; 18:20-24; 26:1-8, etc.). Hezekiah, however, does not really regard himself as sinless (comp. ver. 17). And Hezekiah wept sore. In the East feelings are but little restrained. Joy shows itself in laughter and shouting, grief in tears and shrill cries. Xerxes wept when he thought of the shortness of human life (Herod., 7:46); the Persians rent the air with load cries at the funeral of Masistius (ibid., 9:24); on the news of the defeat at Salamis all Susa \"cried aloud, and wept and wailed without stint\" (ibid., 8:99). So David wept for Jonathan (2 Samuel 1:12) and again for Absalom (2 Samuel 19:1); Joash wept when he heard the words of the Law (2 Kings 22:19); Nehemiah wept at the desolation of Jerusalem (Nehemiah 1:4); the ambassadors of Hezekiah, when disappointed of the object of their embassy, \"wept bitterly\" (Isaiah 33:7). No king in the East puts himself under any restraint, if he has an inclination for either tears or laughter.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah38:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen came the word of the LORD to Isaiah, saying,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 4. - Then came the word of the Lord to Isaiah, saying. The author of Kings describes graphically how Isaiah, after delivering his message, had gone out, but had not reached the middle court of the palace, when his footsteps were arrested, and the Divine voice bade him \"turn again and relieve Hezekiah's fears by a fresh announcement\" (2 Kings 20:4). So swiftly does God answer \"the prayer of faith.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah38:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTGo, and say to Hezekiah, Thus saith the LORD, the God of David thy father, I have heard thy prayer, I have seen thy tears: behold, I will add unto thy days fifteen years.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 5. - Thus saith the Lord,... I have heard thy prayer. According to the author of Kings, the full message sent to Hezekiah was, \"I have heard thy prayer, I have seen thy tears: behold, I will heal thee: on the third day thou shalt go up unto the house of the Lord. And I will add unto thy clays fifteen years; and I will deliver time and this city out of the hand of the King of Assyria; and I will defend this city for mine own sake, and for my servant David's sake\" (2 Kings 20:5, 6). The words in italics are additional to those here reported by Isaiah. Fifteen years. This was doubling, or rather more than doubling, the length of Hezekiah's reign, and allowing him a length of life exceeding that of the great majority of the kings of Judah, who seldom attained the age of fifty. Hezekiah lived to be fifty-four.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah38:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd I will deliver thee and this city out of the hand of the king of Assyria: and I will defend this city.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah38:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd this shall be a sign unto thee from the LORD, that the LORD will do this thing that he hath spoken;VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 7. - And this shall be a sign unto thee from the Lord. It was the day of the free offering of \"signs\" by God to those whom his providence had placed at the head of his people. Ahaz had been offered a sign (Isaiah 7:11), but had refused the offer made him (Isaiah 7:12); the Lord had then \"himself\" given him a sign.\" Hezekiah received a sign to assure him of the complete discomfiture of Sennacherib (Isaiah 37:30); an offer was here made him of a sign of a peculiar kind, and it was offered under peculiar conditions. We learn from 2 Kings that a choice was submitted to him - he was to determine whether time, as measured by a certain timepiece or clock, which was known as \"the dial of Ahaz,\" should make a sudden leap forward - the shadow advancing ten degrees upon the dial (2 Kings 20:9), or whether it should retire backwards, the shadow upon the same dial receding ten degrees. Hezekiah determined in favour of the latter sign, from its appearing to him the more difficult of accomplishment; and on his declaring his decision, the shadow receded to the prescribed distance. Time was rolled backward, or at any rate appeared to be rolled backward; and the king, seeing so great a miracle, accepted without hesitation the further predictions that had been made to him. The Lord will do this thing that he hath spoken. By the nexus of this verse with the preceding, it would naturally be concluded that \"the thing\" to be done was the defence of Jerusalem; but ver. 22, which belongs properly to this part of the narrative, shows the contrary. Hezekiah had asked for a sign\" that he should go up to the house of the Lord.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah38:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBehold, I will bring again the shadow of the degrees, which is gone down in the sun dial of Ahaz, ten degrees backward. So the sun returned ten degrees, by which degrees it was gone down.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 8. - The sun-dial of Ahaz. We are informed by Herodotus that the sun-dial was an invention of the Babylonians (Herod., 2:109), from whom it would readily pass to the Assyrians. Ahaz may have obtained a knowledge of it, or an actual specimen, when he visited Tiglath-Pileser at Damascus (2 Kings 16:10), and, on his return to his capital, have caused one to be erected there. Sun-dials are of several kinds. The one here spoken of seems to have consisted of a set of steps, with a perpendicular gnomon or pole at the top, the shadow of which receded up the steps as the sun rose in the heavens, and descended down them as the sun declined. We must suppose that the sign was given in the forenoon, when the shadow was gradually creeping up the steps. Hezekiah thought that a sudden jump in the same direction would be as nothing compared with a reversal of the motion, and therefore required that the shadow should go back, which it did. How the effect was produced, whether by an eclipse as argued by Mr. Bosanquet ('Transactions of Society of Bibl. Archaeology,' vol. 3. pp. 34-40), or by refraction, or by an actual alteration of the earth's motion, we are not told; but there is reason to believe that the cause, whatever it was, was local, not general, since the King of Babylon subsequently sent ambassadors, to inquire concerning \"the wonder that was done in the land\" (2 Chronicles 32:31). The sun returned ten degrees. We must not press this expression as indicating a real alteration of the sun's place in the heavens. The meaning is that the shadow cast by the sun returned.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah38:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe writing of Hezekiah king of Judah, when he had been sick, and was recovered of his sickness:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 9. - The writing of Hezekiah; rather, a writing. After he had recovered from his illness, Hezekiah, it would seem, retraced his feelings as he lay upon his sick-bed, and embodied them in this monody.

Ver. 6 is against this latter view. I shall go to the gates of the grave; rather, I shall enter in at the gates of hell (or, Hades) - the place of departed spirits (see the comment on Isaiah 14:9). Hezekiah bewails his fate somewhat as Antigone: Ἀλλ ἔμ ὁ παγκοίτας Αἴδης ζῶσαν ἄγει τὰν Ἀχέροντος ἀκτάν (Soph., 'Ant.,' 11. 810-813).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah38:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTI said, I shall not see the LORD, even the LORD, in the land of the living: I shall behold man no more with the inhabitants of the world.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 11. - I shall not see the Lord (comp.

The Jews had not yet attained the conception of a blissful region in Hades, where God manifested himself, and the saints, who were awaiting the resurrection, saw him and praised him. Even the Lord.

The body seems to be viewed as the dwelling-place of the soul. Hezekiah's is to be taken from him, and carried far away, like a shepherd's tent, while he, his true self, i.e. his soul, is left bare and naked (comp. 2 Corinthians 5:1-4). I have cut off like a weaver my life; rather, I have rolled up, like a weaver, my life. The careful weaver rolls up the web, as it advances, to keep it clean and free from dust. Hezekiah had been equally careful of his life; he had about half finished it, when lo! \"Jehovah takes up the fatal scissors\" (Cheyne), and severs the unfinished cloth from the loom (compare the Greek myth of Clotho, Laehesis, and Atropos). With pining sickness; rather, as in the margin, from the thrum. The \"thrum\" is the portion of the warp which adjoins the upper bar of the loom.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah38:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTI reckoned till morning, that, as a lion, so will he break all my bones: from day even to night wilt thou make an end of me.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 13. - I reckoned till morning, etc.; i.e. \"I lay thinking till the morning, that God would crush me as a lion crushes his prey - I expected him all day long to make an end of me.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah38:14VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTLike a crane or a swallow, so did I chatter: I did mourn as a dove: mine eyes fail with looking upward: O LORD, I am oppressed; undertake for me.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 14. - Like a crane or a swallow. The sus, here translated \"crane,\" is probably \"the swift,\" which has a loud, shrill note. The, agur is, perhaps, \"the crane;\" but this is very uncertain. The two words occur as the names of birds only here and in Jeremiah 8:7. So did I chatter; rather, so did I scream (Cheyne). I did mourn; rather, I did moan. Mine eyes fail with looking upward; rather, mine eyes are weak to look upward; i.e. I have scarcely the courage or the strength to look to Jehovah; yet still I do look to him falteringly, and make my appeal: O Lord, I am oppressed; undertake for me (comp. Job 17:3); literally, be Surety for me. \"The image,\" as Mr. Cheyne says, \"is that of a debtor, who is being dragged to prison\" at the suit of an exacting creditor, and for whom there is but one hope of relief; viz. if he can obtain a sufficient surety. Hezekiah calls on God to be the Surety; but God is the Creditor! Still, there is an appeal from God's justice to God's mercy - from Jehovah who punishes to Jehovah who forgives sin; and this appeal Hezekiah seems to intend to make when he beseeches God to \"undertake for him.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah38:15VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWhat shall I say? he hath both spoken unto me, and himself hath done it: I shall go softly all my years in the bitterness of my soul.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 15. - What shall I say? The strain is suddenly changed. Hezekiah's prayer has been answered, and he has received the answer (vers. 5-8). He is \"at a loss to express his wonder and his gratitude\" (Cheyne); comp. 2 Samuel 7:20. God has both spoken unto him - i.e., given him a promise of recovery - and also himself hath done it; i.e. has performed his promise. Already he feels in himself the beginnings of amendment - he is conscious that the worst is past, and that the malady has taken a turn for the better. I shall go softly all my years. Delitzsch renders, \"I shall walk quietly;\" Mr. Cheyne, \"I shall walk at ease;\" both apparently understanding the expression of a quiet, easy life, made the more pleasant by contrast with past pain. But it seems better to understand the \"soft going,\" with Dr. Kay, of a hushed and subdued spirit, consequent upon the crisis past, and thenceforth continuing - the king walking, as it were, perpetually in God's presence. In the bitterness; rather, after the bitterness (Delitzsch), when it has departed; and \"because of it\" (Nagelsbach), through its remembrance.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah38:16VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTO Lord, by these things men live, and in all these things is the life of my spirit: so wilt thou recover me, and make me to live.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 16. - By these things; i.e. \"the things which thou speakest and doest\" (ver. 15).

The pain that I underwent was for the true peace and comfort of my soul (comp. Psalm 94:12; Psalm 119:75; Proverbs 3:12; Hebrews 12:5-11). Thou hast in love, etc.; literally, thou hast loved my soul back from the pit of destruction - as if God's love, beaming on the monarch's soul, had drawn it back from the edge of the pit (comp. Hosea 11:4, \"I drew them with cords of a man, with bands of love\"). For thou hast cast all my sins behind thy back. Where they could be no more seen, and therefore would be no more remembered (comp. Micah 7:19; Psalm 25:7; Psalm 79:8; Isaiah 43:25; Isaiah 64:9, etc.). Hezekiah, though lately he protested his integrity (ver. 3). did not mean to say that he was sinless, lie knew that he had sinned; he regarded his sins as having brought down upon him the sentence of death; as God has revoked the sentence, he knows that he has pardoned his sins and put them away from his remembrance.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah38:18VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor the grave cannot praise thee, death can not celebrate thee: they that go down into the pit cannot hope for thy truth.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 18. The grave cannot praise thee (cormpare the comment on ver. 11). It is avoiding the plain force of these passages to say that Hezekiah only means that those who go to Hades in a state of condemnation cannot be expected there to praise God (Kay). He speaks broadly and generally of all: \"The living, the living, shall praise thee; Sheol cannot praise thee; Death cannot celebrate thee.\" Manifestly, though he believes in a future state, it is one in which there is either no energy at all, or at any rate no devotional energy. He may think, with Isaiah. that \"the righteous man,\" when he is \"taken away,\" will \"enter into peace\" (Isaiah 57:1, 2); but absolute \"peace\" precludes energy (see Arist., 'Eth. Nit.,' 1. 10. § 2). Hezekiah shrinks from losing all his activities, including his sense of personal communion with God. He does not, perhaps, \"look on the condition of the faithful departed as one of comfortless gloom;\" but he views it as one of deprivation, and is unwilling to enter into it. It was by the coming of Christ and the preaching of his gospel that \"life and immortality\" were first truly \"brought to light\" (2 Timothy 1:10).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah38:19VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe living, the living, he shall praise thee, as I do this day: the father to the children shall make known thy truth.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 19. - The living. Those who still enjoy the light of day. The repetition is emphatic, and has the force of \"the living, and the living only.\" The father to the children. Hezekiah may, or may not, have had children himself at the time. Manasseh was not born; but he may have had daughters, or even other sons, who did not survive him. He is not, however, perhaps, thinking of his own ease.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah38:20VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe LORD was ready to save me: therefore we will sing my songs to the stringed instruments all the days of our life in the house of the LORD.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 20. - The Lord was ready to save me; rather, came to my rescue; came and saved me. Therefore we will sing my songs to the stringed instruments; rather, therefore will we play my stringed instruments. Hezekiah calls the stringed instruments his, because he had recalled their use, and re-established them as a part of the temple service after the suspension of that service by Ahaz (2 Chronicles 29:30). His intention now is to take continual part with the Levites in (he choral praises of God, which were a part of the daily worship of the temple. This is to him the natural mode of expressing his thankfulness to God for the mercy vouchsafed him.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah38:21VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor Isaiah had said, Let them take a lump of figs, and lay it for a plaister upon the boil, and he shall recover.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 21. - For Isaiah had said; literally, and Isaiah said. It seems as if this verse and the next had been accidentally omitted from their proper place in the narrative, which was between vers. 6 and 7, and had then been appended by an after-thought. They reproduce nearly, but not exactly, the words of 2 Kings 19:7, 8. Let them take a lump of figs. This remedy is said to be one still employed in the East for the cure of ordinary boils; but it must have been quite insufficient for the cure of such a dangerous tumour, or carbuncle, as that from which Hezekiah was suffering. In miraculous cures, both the Old Testament prophets and our Lord himself frequently employed a means, insufficient in itself, but supernaturally rendered sufficient, to effect the intended purpose (see 1 Kings 17:21; 2 Kings 4:35, 41, 5:14; John 9:6; Mark 7:33; Mark 8:23, etc.). Upon the boil. The term here translated \"boil\" is used in Exodus (Exodus 9:9-11) for the affliction which constituted the sixth plague, in Leviticus (Leviticus 13:18-23) for an ulcer accompanying one of the worst forms of leprosy, in Deuteronomy (Deuteronomy 28:27, 35) for \"the botch of Egypt,\" and in Job (Job 2:7) for the last of the visitations from which he suffered. It is not unlikely that it was of a leprous character.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah38:22VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHezekiah also had said, What is the sign that I shall go up to the house of the LORD?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 22. - Hezekiah also had said; literally, and Hezekiah said. Our translators, both in this verse and at the commencement of ver. 21, have endeavoured to conceal the awkwardness of the nexus, or rather want of nexus, with what precedes, by a modification of the rendering. The true sense is brought out by the proceeding, which is, however, a little arbitrary.NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINE","Isa.39":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah39:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAt that time Merodachbaladan, the son of Baladan, king of Babylon, sent letters and a present to Hezekiah: for he had heard that he had been sick, and was recovered.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 1. - At that time (comp. 2 Chronicles 32:31, where it appears that a part of the business of the ambassadors was to inquire concerning the astronomical marvel which had recently occurred in the land). The embassy probably followed the illness of Hezekiah within a year. Merodach-Baladan. This is a more correct form than the \"Berodach-Baladan\" of 2 Kings 20:12. The name is one common to several Babylonian kings, as to one who reigned about B.C. 1325, to a second who is placed about B.C. 900, and to a third who was contemporary with the Assyrian kings Sargon and Sennacherib. It is this last of whom we have a notice in the present passage. He appears first in the Assyrian inscriptions as a petty prince, ruling a small tract upon the seacoast, about the mouths of the Tigris and Euphrates. Tiglath-Pileser takes tribute front him about B.C. 744. In B.C. 721 we find him advanced to a more prominent position. Taking advantage of the troubles of the time, he shakes off the Assyrians yoke, and makes himself King of Babylon, where he has a reign of twelve years - from B.C. 721 to B.C. 709. This reign is recognized by Sargon in his inscriptions ('Records of the Past,' vol. 9. p. 14), and by the Greek chronologist, Ptolemy, in his 'Canon.' In B.C. 709 Sargon leads an expedition against him, and drives him out of Babylonia into the coast-tract, Chaldea, where he besieges him in his ancestral town Bit-Yakin, takes the city, and makes him prisoner (ibid., p. 15). On the death of Sargon, in B.C. 705, Merodach-Baladan escapes from confinement, and hastens once more to Babylon, where he is acknowledged as king, and has a second reign, which lasts six months (Alex. Polyhist. ap. Euseb., 'Chronicles Can.,' 1. 5. § 1). He is then driven from the country by Sennacherib, and, after various vicissitudes, obliged to become a refugee in Elam (G. Smith, 'Hist. of Babylonia,' pp. 125-128). The name of Merodach-Baladau is composed of the three elements, Merodach (equivalent to \"Mar-duk\"), the god, bal or pal, \"son,\" and iddina, \"has given,\" and thus signifies \"Merodach has given (me) a son.\" The son of Baladan. \"Baladan\" is scarcely a possible Babylonian name. \"Beladan\" would, however, be quite possible, being a name formed on the model of Ishtardddin ('Eponym Canon,' p. 30), Ninip-iddin (p. 35), Ilu-iddin (p. 57), etc. And the corruption of Beladan into Baladan would be easy. Merodach-Baladan III. is called by Sargon \"the son of Yakin;\" but this is perhaps a tribal or local rather than a personal name. Compare Jehu's appellation of \"son of Omri\" (ibid., p. 114). Sent letters and a present to Hezekiah. Hezekiah's fourteenth year was B.C. 714. Merodach-Baladan had then been King of Babylon for eight years, and, knowing that he might at any time be attacked by Sargon, was naturally looking out for alliances with other powers, which Assyria equally threatened. He had recently concluded a treaty with Khumbanigas, King of Elam ('Records of the Past,' vol. 9. p. 14), and had obtained the support of several of the Aramaean tribes on the Euphrates. He now apparently thought that Judaea, which Sargon was also threatening (ch. 38:6), might be induced to join him. Hezekiah's illness and \"the wonder done in the land\" (2 Chronicles 32:31) furnished him with pretexts for an embassy, which probably had more serious objects than either congratulation or scientific inquiry.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah39:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Hezekiah was glad of them, and shewed them the house of his precious things, the silver, and the gold, and the spices, and the precious ointment, and all the house of his armour, and all that was found in his treasures: there was nothing in his house, nor in all his dominion, that Hezekiah shewed them not.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 2. - Hezekiah was glad of them. A more pregnant phrase than that which replaces it in 2 Kings, \"hearkened unto them.\" Hezekiah, like Merodach-Baladan, was looking out for allies, and \"was glad,\" thinking that in Babylon he had found one which might render him important service. Sargon's promptness, however, frustrated his hopes. In B.C. 709 that prince, regarding Merodach-Baladan's proceedings as constituting a real danger to his kingdom, made a great expedition into Babylonia, defeated Merodach-Baladan, and took him prisoner, after which he had himself crowned King of Babylon, and during the remainder of his life ( B.C. 709 to 705) ruled both countries. Showed them the house of his precious things; i.e. his treasury, or store-house. The treasuries of ancient monarchs were actual store-chambers, in which large quantities of the precious metals and valuable objects of various kinds were deposited (see Herod., 2:121; Arrian, 'Exp. Alex.,' 3:16, 18, etc.). The flourishing state of the treasury is an indication that the events here narrated are anterior to the great surrender of treasure to Sennacherib (2 Kings 18:15; 'Epenym Canon,' p. 135). All the house of his armour (comp. Isaiah 22:8). If a warlike alliance was contemplated, it was as important to show the possession of arms as of treasures. There was nothing in his house, nor in all his dominion, that Hezekiah showed them not. We must allow for Oriental hyperbole. The meaning is, that, without any reserve, Hezekiah showed all that he could show.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah39:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen came Isaiah the prophet unto king Hezekiah, and said unto him, What said these men? and from whence came they unto thee? And Hezekiah said, They are come from a far country unto me, even from Babylon.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 3. - Then came Isaiah the prophet. Isaiah comes, unsent for, to rebuke the king (comp. 2 Samuel 12:1-12; 2 Samuel 24:11-14; 1 Kings 12:22-24; 1 Kings 13:2-5; 2 Chronicles 12:5-8; 2 Chronicles 16:7-9; 2 Chronicles 19:2, 3, etc.). This bold attitude was one which prophets were entitled to take by virtue of their office, which called upon them to bear testimony, even before kings, and to have no respect of persons. A similar fearlessness is apparent in Isaiah 7:1-17, where the king with whom Isaiah has to deal was the wicked Ahaz. What said these men? \"These men\" is contemptuous. The demand to know what they said is almost without parallel. Diplomacy, if it is to be successful, must be secret; and Isaiah can scarcely have been surprised that his searching question received no answer. But he was zealous of God's honour, and anxious that Hezekiah should rely on no \"arm of flesh,\" whether it were Egypt or Babylon. Such dependence would straiten God's arm, and prevent him from giving the aid that he was otherwise prepared to give. The desire of the prophet is to warn the king of the danger which he runs by coquetting with human helpers. From whence came they? Isaiah does not ask this question for the sake of information, Doubtless all Jerusalem was agog to see the strange envoys \"from a far country,\" who had now for the first time penetrated to the city of David. All knew whence they had come, and suspected why. Isaiah asks, to force the king to a confession, on which he may base a prophecy and a warning. And Hezekiah said, They are come from a far country. Embassies from distant lands to their courts are made a con-slant subject of boasting by the Assyrian monarchs (see 'Records of the Past,' vol. 1. pp. 28, 68, 95; vol. 7. pp. 49, 51, etc.). Hezekiah, perhaps, is \"lifted up\" (2 Chronicles 32:25) by the honour paid him, and intends to impress Isaiah with a sense of his greatness - \"The men are come all the way from Babylon to see me!\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah39:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen said he, What have they seen in thine house? And Hezekiah answered, All that is in mine house have they seen: there is nothing among my treasures that I have not shewed them.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 4. - What have they seen? Isaiah had, no doubt, heard of what Hezekiah had done (ver. 2); but he wished to have the confession of it from his own mouth before delivering his sentence. Hezekiah tells him the truth, since he is not ashamed of his act, but rather glories in it. He has shown the ambassadors everything, and has thereby made them eager to secure his alliance.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah39:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen said Isaiah to Hezekiah, Hear the word of the LORD of hosts:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 5. - Hear the word of the Lord of hosts. Either the prophet had been specially charged with a Divine message to the king before he sought his presence, or the prophetic afflatus now came on him suddenly. The former is, on the whole, more probable.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah39:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBehold, the days come, that all that is in thine house, and that which thy fathers have laid up in store until this day, shall be carried to Babylon: nothing shall be left, saith the LORD.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 6. - Behold, the days come; literally, the days [are] coming, or [are] approaching. Of the exact \"times and seasons, which the Father hath put in his own power\" (Acts 1:7), the prophets generally knew nothing. They were mouth-pieces, to declare the Divine will, not keen-witted politicians, forecasting results by the exercise of sharp-sightedness and sagacity. To suppose that Isaiah foresaw by mere human wisdom the Babylonian conquest of Judaea, as Charles the Great did the ravages of the Northmen (R. Williams, 'Hebrew Prophets,' vol. 1. p. 429), is to give him credit for a sagacity quite unexampled and psychologically impossible. The kingdom of Babylon was one among many that were struggling hard to maintain independence against the grasping and encroaching Assyria. From the time of Tiglath-Pileser IX. she had been continually losing ground. Both Sargon and Sennacherib trampled her underfoot, overran her territory, captured her towns, and reduced her under direct Assyrian government. Till Assyria should be swept away, a Babylonian conquest of Palestine was impossible. To suppose it was like supposing a Russian conquest of Holland, while Germany bars the way. Nothing short of the true prophetic afflatus, which is God the Holy Ghost speaking by the mouth of his servants, could have made such an anticipation. And with Isaiah, as Mr. Cheyne says, it is \"not a mere presentiment; it is a calm and settled conviction, based on a direct revelation, and confirmed by a deep insight into the laws of the Divine government.\" All that is in thine house. Not, of course, exactly all that was there when Isaiah spoke, but all the wealth that should be in the royal palace when the time of the Babylonian captivity arrived. (For the fulfilment, see 2 Chronicles 36:18.) That which thy fathers have laid up in store. A portion of this was carried off by Sennacherib in his first expedition (2 Kings 18:14-16); but the bulk of the temple treasures - the gifts of many kings - remained untouched until they were removed to Babylon by Nebuchadnezzar (Daniel 1:2; Daniel 5:2; 2 Kings 24:13; 2 Kings 25:13-17).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah39:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd of thy sons that shall issue from thee, which thou shalt beget, shall they take away; and they shall be eunuchs in the palace of the king of Babylon.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 7. - Of thy sons that shall issue from thee. Hezekiah had at the time, probably, no son, since Manasseh, who succeeded him upon the throne, was not born till two years later. Besides Manasseh, he appears to have had a son, Amariah, who was an ancestor of the Prophet Zephaniah (Zephaniah 1:1). He may, of course, have also had others. His descendants, rather than his actual sons, seem to be here intended; and the fulfilment of the prophecy is to be found in Daniel 1:3, where certain \"of the king's seed\" are mentioned among the Israelites who served as eunuchs in the palace of Nebuchadnezzar.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah39:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen said Hezekiah to Isaiah, Good is the word of the LORD which thou hast spoken. He said moreover, For there shall be peace and truth in my days.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 8. - Good is the word. While there is resignation, there is no doubt something also of selfishness, in Hezekiah's acceptance of the situation. \"Apres mot le deluge\" is a saying attributed to a modern Frenchman. Hezekiah's egotism is less pronounced and less cynical. He thinks with gratitude of the \"peace and steadfastness\" which are to be \"in his day;\" he does not dwell in thought on the coming \"deluge.\" The \"word of the Lord\" is \"good\" to him in more ways than one. It has assured him of coming male offspring - of sons to sit upon his throne, and save him from the curse of childlessness. And it has assured him of a rest for his nation - a respite, so that the Babylonian struggle shall not follow immediately upon the Assyrian; but there shall be a \"breathing-space\" (Ezra 9:8), a tranquil time, during which Israel may \"dwell in a peaceable habitation, and in sure dwellings, and in quiet resting-places\" (Isaiah 32:18).NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINE","Isa.3":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah3:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor, behold, the Lord, the LORD of hosts, doth take away from Jerusalem and from Judah the stay and the staff, the whole stay of bread, and the whole stay of water,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 1-7. - GOD'S JUDGMENT UPON JERUSALEM. The general denunciations against Israel of the two preceding chapters are here turned especially against Jerusalem. God will deprive her of all her superior and more honorable classes (vers. 1-3); and will give her \"children\" for her rulers (ver. 4). There will be continued oppression, and the rise of an insolent and undutiful spirit (ver. 5). Those fit to bear rule will refuse to do so (vers. 6, 7). Verse 1. - The Lord, the Lord of hosts (see note on Isaiah 1:24). The stay and the staff; rather, stay and staff. Neither word has the article. The latter is the feminine form of the former; and the intention is to announce that all support of every kind is about to be withdrawn. The whole stay of bread... of water. Mr. Cheyne agrees with Hitzig and Knobel that this clause is probably a gloss on the text, subsequently introduced into it, and a gloss which (lid not proceed from a very enlightened commentator. The \"stay\" and \"staff\" intended are certainly not, literal \"bread\" and \"water,\" but the powerful and respectable classes enumerated in the two following verses. If the words are Isaiah's, he must have intended them to be taken metaphorically.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah3:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe mighty man, and the man of war, the judge, and the prophet, and the prudent, and the ancient,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 2. - The mighty man, and the man of war; or, hero and warrior. The first rank is given to those distinguished in war, as being held in the highest esteem, and perhaps as actually, under the coming circumstances, the men of most importance to the country. It is thus implied, as later (vers. 25, 26) it is expressly taught, that the impending visitation will be a terrible invasion. The judge, and the prophet; literally, judge and prophet. The judge holds his place as one of the highest officers of the state (see Isaiah 1:26); the prophet holds a lower position than might have been expected, on account of the writer's humility. The prudent; rather, the diviner, as the word is translated in Deuteronomy 18:14; 1 Samuel 6:2; Isaiah 44:25; Jeremiah 27:9; Jeremiah 29:8; Ezekiel 13:9; Micah 3:7; Zechariah 10:2; or soothsayer, as in Joshua 13:22. Isaiah arranges the classes, not so much according to the order in which he values them, as to that in which they were valued by the people. The ancient; i.e. \"the elder,\" as the word is translated commonly. The \"elders\" had an ascertained position in the state under the monarchy (2 Samuel 5:3; 2 Samuel 19:11; 1 Kings 8:1; 1 Kings 20:7; 2 Kings 6:32, etc.).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah3:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe captain of fifty, and the honourable man, and the counseller, and the cunning artificer, and the eloquent orator.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 3. - The captain of fifty. \"Captains of fifties\" were scarcely at this period \"civil officers\" (Cheyne). They represent simply the lowest grade of officers in the army (2 Kings 1:9, 11, 13). Honorable. The same expression is used again in Isaiah 9:15. It occurs also in 2 Kings 5. I and Job 22:8. The cunning artificer. \"All the craftsmen and smiths\" in Jerusalem were carried away by Nebuchadnezzar in the captivity of Jehoiachin (2 Kings 24:14; cf. Jeremiah 24:1). They were among the most valuable of the population, in time of war no less than of peace, since on them depended the construction and repair of the military engines which were regarded as of so much importance (2 Chronicles 26:15). The eloquent orator; rather, the expert enchanter (comp. Ecclesiastes 10:11; Jeremiah 8:17).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah3:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd I will give children to be their princes, and babes shall rule over them.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 4. - I will give children to be their princes; rather, youths than \"children.\" The extreme youth of the later kings of Judah at the date of their accession is very remarkable. After Hezekiah, only one was as much as twenty-five years old when he came to the throne. Jehoahaz was twenty-three (2 Kings 23:31); Amon, twenty-two (2 Kings 21:19); Zedekiah twenty-one (2 Kings 24:18); Jehoiachin, eighteen (2 Kings 24:8); Manasseh, twelve (2 Kings 21:1); and Josiah eight (2 Kings 22:1). Thus this prophecy was fulfilled to the letter. And babes shall rule over them; literally, puerilities shall rule over them; i.e. the youths shall behave in a childish way.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah3:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the people shall be oppressed, every one by another, and every one by his neighbour: the child shall behave himself proudly against the ancient, and the base against the honourable.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 5. - And the people shall be oppressed, etc.; rather, shall oppress each man his fellow, and each man his companion. This would be no new thing (see Isaiah 1:17, 21, 23), but perhaps might be more widely spread, having passed from the upper classes to the lower ones, as is usual with vices. The child; rather, the youth. Shall behave himself proudly; or, insolently. The respect for age inculcated by the Law (Leviticus 19:32) shall disappear. Youths shall set at naught the counsel of the aged. The spirit of Rehoboam shall prevail over that of Solomon, with the usual result - rashness, recklessness, and failure. And the base, etc. Respect for station shall likewise disappear. The dregs of the people shall grow insolent towards those above them in the social scale; and thus the old social order shall be inverted.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah3:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWhen a man shall take hold of his brother of the house of his father, saying, Thou hast clothing, be thou our ruler, and let this ruin be under thy hand:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 6. - When a man shall take hold of his brother. A new departure. In the general anarchy described (vers. 4, 5) it will be felt that something must be done. A man will take hold of his brother (i.e. his fellow) in his (i.e. the latter's) father's house, where he lives in seclusion, and say to him, \"Thou hast clothing\" (or, \"thou art decently clad\"), \"thou must be our ruler; let this ruin\" (i.e. \"this ruined state\") \"be under thy band.\" This ruin; literally, this stumbling-block (see Zephaniah 1:3; and compare the uniform translation of the kindred noun mikshol (Leviticus 19:14; Psalm 119:165; Isaiah 57:14; Jeremiah 6:21; Ezekiel 52:20; 7:10, etc.). The Jewish community is meant, which was full of stumbling itself, and might well cause all those to stumble who came into contact with it.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah3:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTIn that day shall he swear, saying, I will not be an healer; for in my house is neither bread nor clothing: make me not a ruler of the people.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 7. - In that day shall he swear; or, lift up his voice - speaking with emotion (Kay). I will not be an healer; literally, a binder-up (comp. Isaiah 1:6); \"I will not undertake to heal the calamities of the state.\" In my house is neither bread nor clothing; i.e. \"I am not a wealthy man; I have no stores laid up; I am quite unfit to be the people's ruler.\" Make me not; or, ye shall not make me.

The sins of the men. (Vers. 8-15). These are declared to be partly sins of speech, but mainly sins of act (ver. 8). Of sins of speech the only one specified is the open and shameless declaration of their wickedness (ver. 9). Under the head of sins of act are enumeratedNEWLINENEWLINE(1) childishness and effeminacy;NEWLINENEWLINE(2) irreligion and leading people away from God (ver. 12);NEWLINENEWLINE(3) oppression of the poor and afflicted (vers. 14, 15).NEWLINENEWLINEThe enumeration of the sins is mixed with exhortation and comment in such a way as to give rise to the conjecture that we have here, not the original prophecy as the author penned it, but a later \"summary\" of several prophetical discourses, which summary itself is \"a little fragmentary\" (Cheyne). Verse 8. - Jerusalem is ruined; or, has come to ruin - the \"perfect of prophetic certainty\" (Cheyne) - (comp. Amos 5:2, \"The virgin of Israel is fallen\"). Their tongue and their doings. Sins of the tongue are denounced in the Old Testament as well as in the New, though not, perhaps, so frequently (see Exodus 20:7; Exodus 21:17; Exodus 22:28; Exodus 23:1, 2; Psalm 31:18; Psalm 94:4, etc.). To provoke the eyes of his glory. This is an unusual metaphor. God's glory seems here to be identified with himself, as being of his very essence; and thus \"provoking the eyes of his glory\" is simply provoking him to look on them with anger.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah3:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe shew of their countenance doth witness against them; and they declare their sin as Sodom, they hide it not. Woe unto their soul! for they have rewarded evil unto themselves.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 9. - The show of their countenance doth witness against them. This is not in itself a sin, but it is a sign of frequent and habitual sin. Vice, long indulged in, stamps its mark upon the countenance, giving men what is called \"a bad expression\" - a guilty and hardened look. It does not require a skilled physiognomist to detect at a glance the habitual criminal or sensualist. They declare their sin as Sodom. Not only does their countenance betray them, but, like the Sodomites (Genesis 19:5, 9), they boldly and impudently declare their wicked purposes beforehand, and make no attempt at concealment. Hypocrisy has been said to be the homage that vice pays to virtue. Where there is none, where vice has ceased to shroud or veil itself, a very advanced stage of wickedness has been reached. They have rewarded evil unto themselves. They have \"received in themselves the recompense of their error which was meet\" (Romans 1:27). Their sins have at once marred their countenance and injured their moral nature.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah3:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTSay ye to the righteous, that it shall be well with him: for they shall eat the fruit of their doings.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 10. - Say ye to the righteous. The mention of the fact that the men of Jerusalem have permanently injured their moral natures by sin, and thus \"rewarded evil to themselves,\" leads the prophet to declare at this point, parenthetically, the general law, which extends alike to the evil and the good - that men receive in themselves the recompense of their deeds. The righteous raise their moral nature, become better, and, in becoming better, become happier. \"It is well with them, for of the fruit of their doings they eat.\" The wicked deprave and corrupt themselves, lower their moral nature, become worse than they were, and, in becoming worse, become more miserable. \"Woe unto them! with them it is ill; for the achievement of their hands is given them.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah3:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWoe unto the wicked! it shall be ill with him: for the reward of his hands shall be given him.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah3:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAs for my people, children are their oppressors, and women rule over them. O my people, they which lead thee cause thee to err, and destroy the way of thy paths.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 12. - As for my people. Return is now made to the sins of the dwellers in Jerusalem, and the first thing noted is that the people suffer from the childishness and effeminacy of their rulers. The rulers are called \"oppressors\" by the way here, the sin of oppression being dwelt on later (vers. 14, 15). Here the emphatic words are \"children,\" \"women.\" Children (see ver. 4). The rulers are \"children,\" or rather \"babes\" - foolish, capricious, cowardly. It is not clear that any prince in particular is meant; rather, by the plural form, the upper class generally seems to be intended, as in Isaiah 1:10, 17, 23, etc. Women; comp. Herod., 8:88, where Xerxes says that \"his men have shown themselves women, and his women men;\" and see also Virg., 'AEneid '-NEWLINENEWLINE\"O vere Phrygia, neque enim Phryges.\" The rulers were womanly, i.e. weak, wavering, timid, impulsive, passionate, and are therefore called actual \"women.\" There is no allusion to female sovereigns. They which lead thee cause thee to err; or, they which direct thee lead thee astray. Professing to point out the right path, they led men away from it. Destroy the way; literally, swallow it up, or obliterate it.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah3:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe LORD standeth up to plead, and standeth to judge the people.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 13. - The Lord standeth up to plead. The great sin of the time was oppression of the poor by the rich, and especially by the rulers (Isaiah 1:15, 17, 21). In noticing this, the prophet, to give more weight to his denunciation, introduces Jehovah as standing up, and coming forward on the popular side, to plead the people's cause, and remonstrate with their oppressors. There is great force in this sudden entrance on the scene of Jehovah himself, as Pleader and Judge. And... judge the people; rather, the peoples. Primarily, Israel is God's care; but he does not stop at this point. All the nations of the earth are also under his protection.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah3:14VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe LORD will enter into judgment with the ancients of his people, and the princes thereof: for ye have eaten up the vineyard; the spoil of the poor is in your houses.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 14. - The ancients... the princes. These were the chief oppressors. They delivered the judgments, and it was by them that justice was perverted. Jehovah therefore enters specially into judgment with them. For ye have eaten up; rather, So ye have eaten up. Jehovah is supposed to address the unjust judges. He reproaches them with having \"eaten up,\" or rather \"scorched up,\" his vineyard, i.e. Israel (comp. Isaiah 5:1-7), and taxes them with having still their ill-gotten gains in their houses. \"So ye,\" he says, \"have thus acted - ye whose duty it was to have acted so differently.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah3:15VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWhat mean ye that ye beat my people to pieces, and grind the faces of the poor? saith the Lord GOD of hosts.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 15. - What mean ye? i.e. \"What has come over you?\" or \"What strange perversity has possessed yon?\" (Kay). That ye beat my people to pieces, etc. The strongest possible expressions are used to mark God's abhorrence of the oppression to which the poor were subjected. Under the Law, he constituted himself the champion of such persons (see Exodus 22:22-24).NEWLINENEWLINE2. The sins of the women. (Vers. 16-26.) These may be summed up under the three heads of pride, wanton manners (ver. 16), and love of dress and ornament (vers. 18-23). It was natural that, with increased commerce (2 Kings 14:22; Isaiah 2:16) and more frequent communication with foreign nations, such as Assyria (2 Kings 16:7-10) and Babylon (2 Kings 20:12, 13), there should be an increase of luxury, and quite in accordance with Eastern ideas that the luxury should particularly show itself in the dress and adornment of the women. The Egyptian remains show an advanced state of luxury among the women at a time anterior to Moses; and in Assyria, though the evidence is less abundant, we find also indications of a similar kind. The Jews, whose regard for their women was high, are not likely to have been behindhand in the gallantry which shows itself in heaping ornament and the newest appliances of civilization on the weaker sex.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah3:16VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTMoreover the LORD saith, Because the daughters of Zion are haughty, and walk with stretched forth necks and wanton eyes, walking and mincing as they go, and making a tinkling with their feet:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 16. - The daughters of Zion. It is over-fanciful to go beyond the plain meaning of the words here, and suppose allegory. \"The daughters of Zion\" are the female inhabitants of Jerusalem. Are haughty; or, proud - like the men (Isaiah 2:11, 12, 17). Walk with stretched forth necks and wanton eyes. Mr. Cheyne translates, \"ogling eyes.\" Both actions indicate the desire to attract men's attention, and are shameless and immodest. Walking and mincing as they go; i.e. taking short steps in an affectedly childish way. Making a tinkling with their feet. This meaning is generally accepted, though not very certain. It has been suggested that the anklets which they wore (ver. 18) had silver bells attached to them.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah3:17VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTTherefore the Lord will smite with a scab the crown of the head of the daughters of Zion, and the LORD will discover their secret parts.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 17. - Therefore the Lord will smite with a seal. Thus destroying their beauty by producing baldness (comp. ver. 24; and for the meaning \"smite with a scab,\" see Leviticus 13:2; Leviticus 14:56).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah3:18VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTIn that day the Lord will take away the bravery of their tinkling ornaments about their feet, and their cauls, and their round tires like the moon,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 18. - The bravery of their tinkling ornaments about their feet; rather, of their anklets. Anklets were worn by the Egyptian women from the time of the twelfth dynasty (about B.C. 1900). They were, in general, plain rings of metal, but appear to have been sometimes set with precious stones (see Lepsius, 'Denkmaler,' pt. 2. pls. 128, 129). No bells appear attached to any; but bells were known in Assyria from the time of Sennacherib ('Ancient Monarchies,' vol. 1. p. 417, 2nd edit.). Their cauls; margin, networks. The marginal rendering is probably correct (comp. LXX., ἐμπλόκια). Network caps to contain the hair seem to be intended (so Kimchi, Saadiah, Jarchi, Rosenmüller, Kay). Mr. Cheyne prefers \"wreaths worn round the forehead, reaching from one ear to the other.\" Round tires like the moon; rather, crescents. Flat ornaments in metal, like a young moon, generally worn suspended round the neck (see Judges 8:26, where the same word occurs).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah3:19VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe chains, and the bracelets, and the mufflers,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 19. - The chains, and the bracelets, and the mufflers; rather, the ear-drops, and the armlets, and the veils. Earrings were worn from very ancient times by both the Assyrians and the Egyptians. The ring had frequently a pendant hanging from it. Men wore armlets in Assyria, and both men and women in Egypt (Lepsius, 'Denktamer,' pt. 3. pl. 1). Veils have always been regarded in the East as almost a necessary part of female attire.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah3:20VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe bonnets, and the ornaments of the legs, and the headbands, and the tablets, and the earrings,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 20. - The bonnets; rather, the headgear. It is quite uncertain what this was, since we have no representations of Hebrew women. Egyptian women commonly wore a mere fillet with pendant ends. The Hebrew word here employed is used in Exodus of the head-dress of the priests (Exodus 39:28). The ornaments of the legs. These are explained as chains connecting the two anklets together. The head-bands, and the tablets, and the ear-rings; rather, the girdles, and the scent-bottles, and the amulets. Scent-bottles and jars for holding sweet-smelling unguents are among the most frequent toilette articles recovered from Egyptian tombs and Assyrian palaces. Amulets have been worn in the East from very ancient times, and are still trusted in as much as ever. They frequently take the form of ornaments.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah3:21VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe rings, and nose jewels,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 21. - The rings; literally, seal-rings, or signet-rings. Such were known in Egypt from the time of Joseph (Genesis 41:42), and probably earlier. It would seem from the present passage that their use was not confined to men. Nose-jewels. Actual nose-rings are not represented in any of the ancient remains; and the use of them seems to be confined to very barbarous communities. Probably the \"nose-jewels\" here mentioned were ornaments depending from the forehead and touching the upper part of the nose,NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah3:22VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe changeable suits of apparel, and the mantles, and the wimples, and the crisping pins,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 22. - The changeable suite of apparel; rather, the festival robes (Revised Version), or the full-dress suits; i.e. those worn upon grand occasions, and then put off and set aside. The mantles, and the wimples, and the crisping-pins; rather, the upper petticoats, the wraps, and the purses. An inner and an outer tunic or petticoat were commonly worn by females of the higher class in the East. The inner tunic was a simple linen vest; but the outer was generally of a better material, and richly ornamented. Outside this, a sort of wrap, or cloak, was worn occasionally (see Ruth 3:15). Purses were, no doubt, carried by wealthy persons of both sexes; but their mention in this list does not seem very appropriate. Perhaps toilet-bags of some kind or other are intended (see 2 Kings 5:23).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah3:23VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe glasses, and the fine linen, and the hoods, and the vails.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 23. - The glasses; rather, the mirrors. In ancient times these were not made of glass, but of some metal which took a high polish. Most commonly, the material seems to have been bronze. Many such mirrors have been found in Egypt, a few in Assyria, in Etruria a considerable number. They are of small size, intended to be carried in the hand, and have for that purpose a metal or a wooden handle, which is sometimes highly artistic. The fine linen; rather, the muslin robes. Sedin, the Hebrew word used, is probably a corruption or analogue of sin-don, the Greek name for Indian fabrics. It is only used here and in Judges 14:12, 13; Proverbs 31:24. The hoods, and the vails; or, the turbans and the scarfs. The word translated\" hood\" is nearly the same as that which designates the head-dress of the high priest in Exodus (Exodus 28:4, 37, 39; Exodus 29:6, etc.) and Leviticus (Leviticus 8:9; Leviticus 16:4), which seems to have been a \"turban\" (see note on Exodus 28:4). The other word, here translated \"vail,\" occurs only in this place and Song of Solomon 5:7. Its exact meaning is uncertain; but it can scarcely be a veil; since \"veils\" have been already mentioned (ver. 19).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah3:24VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd it shall come to pass, that instead of sweet smell there shall be stink; and instead of a girdle a rent; and instead of well set hair baldness; and instead of a stomacher a girding of sackcloth; and burning instead of beauty.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 24. - Instead of sweet smell; literally, spice (comp. Exodus 35:28; 1 Kings 10:10, etc.). Stink; rather, rottenness, as translated in Isaiah 5:24 (compare the cognate verb in Leviticus 26:39). Instead of a girdle a rent. So Lowth and Kay; but most moderns prefer the meaning given by the Septuagint and Vulgate, \"instead of a girdle, a rope.\" The word used occurs only in this place. Instead of well-set hair baldness (compare above, ver. 17). By \"well-set hair\" seems to be meant \"hair arranged with such exactness and order as to look like a work of art.\" The exact arrangement of the hair is very remarkable, both in the Egyptian and the Assyrian sculptures. Instead of such elaborate attempts to improve their looks, the daughters of Jerusalem would soon pluck their hair out by the roots, or shave it off, in mourning. A girding of sackcloth (comp. Genesis 37:34; 2 Samuel 3:31, etc.; and for the adoption of the custom by women, see 2 Samuel 21:10; Joel 1:8). Burning instead of beauty. This meaning is now generally acknowledged, the sense of \"burning\" being borne out by the cognate verb used in Proverbs 6:28; Isaiah 43:2, and the cognate noun used in Exodus 21:25. The\" burning\" intended is probably branding by a barbarous enemy (see Herod., 7:233; 'Hist. Tamerlau.,' p. 320).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah3:25VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThy men shall fall by the sword, and thy mighty in the war.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 25. - Thy men; rather, thy people; i.e. the inhabitants of Jerusalem generally. Note here the first distinct statement that the coming visitation will be one of war.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah3:26VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd her gates shall lament and mourn; and she being desolate shall sit upon the ground.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 26. - Her gates. The sudden change of person is common in Oriental poetry. Shall lament and mourn. On account of their destruction, which would be very complete (see Lamentations 1:4; Lamentations 2:9; Nehemiah 1:3; Nehemiah 2:13). Conquerors could not do more than break breaches in the walls of a town, but they carefully destroyed the gates. Being desolate; or, emptied - plundered of everything, and so far \"cleansed\" from her abominations. Shall sit upon the ground. In deep grief (see Job 2:13; and comp. Isaiah 47:1; Lamentations 2:10). So in the coin of Vespasian, the captive Judah (Judea capta) sits upon the ground.NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINE","Isa.40":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah40:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTComfort ye, comfort ye my people, saith your God.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 1. - Comfort ye, comfort ye my people. The key-note is struck at once. With that iteration which is his favourite mode of emphasizing what is important (see the comment on Isaiah 38:11), the prophet declares that he and his brethren have a direct mission from God to \"comfort\" Israel. Note the encouragement contained in the expressions, \"my people,\" and \"your God.\" Israel is not cast off, even when most deeply afflicted.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah40:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTSpeak ye comfortably to Jerusalem, and cry unto her, that her warfare is accomplished, that her iniquity is pardoned: for she hath received of the LORD'S hand double for all her sins.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 2. - Speak ye comfortably to Jerusalem; literally, speak ye to the heart of Jerusalem. Address her inmost feelings, her very spirit and soul. Her warfare is accomplished... is pardoned... hath received. These perfects can only be viewed as \"perfects of prophetic certainty.\" According to every theory of the authorship of Isaiah 40-46, they were written before the close of the Captivity, when Israel's warfare was not yet accomplished, her iniquity not yet fully pardoned. Isaiah, however, sees all as already accomplished in the Divine counsels, and so announces it to the people. Israel's warfare, her long term of hard service (comp. Job 7:1), will assuredly come to an end; she will thoroughly turn to God, and then her iniquity will be pardoned, she will be considered to have suffered enough. Double. \"It was the ordinary rule under the Law that 'for all manner of trespass' a man condemned by the judges should pay double\" (Kay; comp. Exodus 22:9). Heathen legislators adopted the same rule for certain offences (Arist, 'Eth. Nic.,' 3:5, § 8). It is not here intended to assert that the law of Divine judgment is to exact double; but only to assure Israel that, having been amply punished, she need fear no further vengeance (comp. Isaiah 61:7).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah40:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe voice of him that crieth in the wilderness, Prepare ye the way of the LORD, make straight in the desert a highway for our God.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 3. - The voice of him that crieth; rather, the voice of one that crieth. A voice sounds in the prophet's ear, crying to repentance. For God to come down on earth, for his glory to be revealed in any signal way, by the restoration of a nation, or the revelation of himself in Christ, or the final establishment of his kingdom, the \"way\" must be first \"prepared\" for him. The hearts of the disobedient must be turned to the wisdom of the just. In the wilderness; either, \"the wilderness of this world\" (Kay), or \"the wilderness separating Babylonia from Palestine\" (Delitzsch), in a part of which John the Baptist afterwards preached. Prepare ye the way of the Lord. The \"way of the Lord\" is \"the way of holiness\" (Isaiah 35:8). There is one only mode of \"preparing\" it - the mode adopted by John Baptist (Matthew 3:2-12), the mode pointed out by the angel who announced him (Luke 1:17), the mode insisted on in the Collect for the Third Sunday in Advent. The voice enjoins on the prophets of the captive nation to prepare the hearts of the people for the coming manifestation of God.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah40:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTEvery valley shall be exalted, and every mountain and hill shall be made low: and the crooked shall be made straight, and the rough places plain:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 4. - Every valley shall be exalted, etc.; rather, let every valley be exalted. The prophets are to see that the poor and lowly are raised up; the proud and self-righteous depressed; the crooked and dishonest induced to change their ways for those of simplicity and integrity; the rude, rough, and harsh rendered courteous and mild. \"In general, the meaning is that Israel is to [be made] take care that the God who is coming to deliver it shall find it in such an inward and outward state as befits his... purpose\" (Delitzsch, 'Comment. on Isaiah,' vol. 2. p. 142).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah40:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the glory of the LORD shall be revealed, and all flesh shall see it together: for the mouth of the LORD hath spoken it.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 5. - And the glory of the Lord shall be revealed. Then, when the preparation is complete, there shall be a revelation of the glory and might of Jehovah. The nature of the revelation is for the present shrouded in darkness; but it is a revelation which is not confined to Israel. All flesh shall see it together. It shall draw to it the attention of the human race at large. While the restoration of Israel to Palestine is the primary fulfilment of the prophecy, that restoration clearly does not exhaust its meaning, which points on to the restoration of all mankind to God's favour in Christ by the ἐπιφάνεια of his advent in the flesh, which has drown, or will draw, the eyes of \"all flesh.\" For the mouth of the Lord hath spoken it. A repetition of the emphatic clause wherewith Isaiah had terminated the third section of his first prophecy (Isaiah 1:20). It occurs again in Isaiah 58:14. No other writer uses the expression.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah40:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe voice said, Cry. And he said, What shall I cry? All flesh is grass, and all the goodliness thereof is as the flower of the field:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 6. - The voice said, Cry; rather, a voice of else that sayeth, Cry. It is a second voice, distinct from that of ver. 3, that now reaches the prophet's ear - a voice responded to by another. The speakers seem to be angels, who contrast the perishable nature of man with the enduringness and unchangingness of God. The point of their discourse is that \"the Word of the Lord endureth for ever\" (ver. 8), and therefore the preceding promises (vers. 2, 5) are sure. And he said; rather, and one said. A second voice answered the first, and asked what the proclamation was to be. In reply its terms were given. All flesh is grass (comp. Isaiah 37:27; and see also Job 5:25; Psalm 90:5; Psalm 92:7; Psalm 103:15). The goodliness thereof is as the flower of the field. So Ephraim was compared in ch. 28:1 to \"a fading flower.\" The similitude is found also in Job 14:2 and in Psalm 103:15. Homer approaches the idea in his well-known simile, Οἵη περ φύλλων γενεὴ τοιήδε καὶ ἀνδρῶν ('Iliad,' 6:146).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah40:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe grass withereth, the flower fadeth: because the spirit of the LORD bloweth upon it: surely the people is grass.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 7. - The flower fadeth: because the Spirit of the Lord bloweth upon it. When the hot winds, which God sends, blow in spring-time, the flowers fade; when a destroying breath from him (see Isaiah 30:33) passes over the generations of men, they perish. Surely the people is grass. Either a mere repetition of \"all flesh is grass\" (ver. 6) with an asseveration, or an intimation that \"the people\" of Israel is not exempt from the lot of mankind in general, but shares it.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah40:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe grass withereth, the flower fadeth: but the word of our God shall stand for ever.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 8. - The Word of our God shall stand for ever. Amid all human frailty, shiftingness, changefulness, there is one thing that endures, and stroll endure - God's Word (see the comment on the first part of ver. 6). In the sureness of God's promises is Israel's exceeding comfort.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah40:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTO Zion, that bringest good tidings, get thee up into the high mountain; O Jerusalem, that bringest good tidings, lift up thy voice with strength; lift it up, be not afraid; say unto the cities of Judah, Behold your God!VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 9-11. - The time of Israel's restoration has drawn nigh. The preparation has been made. The voice calling to preparation is silent. The promises are now on the verge of receiving their accomplishment. It is fitting that some one should announce the fact to the nation. Isaiah calls on the company of prophets living at the time to do so (ver. 9). They are to take up a commanding position, to speak with a loud voice, and to proclaim the good tidings to Zion, to Jerusalem, and to the cities of Judah (comp. Isaiah 44:26). The terms of the proclamation are then given (vers. 10, 11). Verse 9. - O Zion, that bringest good tidings, etc.; rather, as in the margin, O thou that tellest good tidings to Zion (so the LXX., Gesenius, Rosenmuller, Maurer, Hitzig, Knobel, and Kay). Get thee up into the high mountain; rather, into a high mountain. Choose an elevated spot from which to make proclamation. O Jerusalem, that bringest, etc.; again, as in the margin, O thou that tellest good tidings to Jerusalem. The repetition, with a slight change, is quite in the manner of Isaiah. The cities of Judah. These would be in rains, no less than Jerusalem herself (see Isaiah 46:26; 64:10).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah40:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBehold, the Lord GOD will come with strong hand, and his arm shall rule for him: behold, his reward is with him, and his work before him.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 10. - The Lord God; literally, the Lord Jehovah. With strong hand; or, with strength. His arm shall rule for him. Kay translates, \"His arm shall get him rule;\" i.e. the manifestation, which he shall make of his power, shall cause his kingdom to be extended far and wide upon the earth. \"The Lord's arm,\" \"the Lord's hand,\" are favourite expressions of Isaiah's (Isaiah 5:25; Isaiah 9:12; Isaiah 10:4; Isaiah 11:11; Isaiah 31:3; Isaiah 51:9; Isaiah 53:1; Isaiah 62:3, etc.). His reward is with him, and his work before him; rather, his wage is with him, and his recompense before him - a case of synonymous parallelism. The phrase is repeated in Isaiah 62:11. Mr. Cheyne understands \"the reward which God gives to his faithful ones\" to be meant. But perhaps it is better to understand, with Dr. Kay, that in the \"little flock\" which he restores to Palestine God finds his own reward and recompense - the compensation for all his care and trouble.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah40:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHe shall feed his flock like a shepherd: he shall gather the lambs with his arm, and carry them in his bosom, and shall gently lead those that are with young.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 11. - He shall feed his flock like a shepherd. The similitude is a favourite one with the psalmists (Psalm 77:20; Psalm 78:52; Psalm 80:1), and occurs again later on in Isaiah (Isaiah 49:9, 10). Its beauty and sweetness have been widely recognized. He shall gather the lambs; collect them, i.e., when they have strayed from the flock. Shall gently lead those that are with young; rather, those that give suck (comp. Genesis 33:3, where the same word is used). Ewes that are suckling their lambs require specially tender treatment.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah40:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWho hath measured the waters in the hollow of his hand, and meted out heaven with the span, and comprehended the dust of the earth in a measure, and weighed the mountains in scales, and the hills in a balance?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 12-31. - THE MIGHT AND GREATNESS OF GOD CONTRASTED WITH THE WEAKNESS OF MAN AND THE FUTILITY OF IDOLS. If captive Israel is to be induced to turn' to God, and so hasten the time of its restoration to his favour and to its own land, it must be by rising to a worthy conception of the nature and attributes of the Almighty. The prophet, therefore, in the remainder of this chapter, paints in glorious language the power and greatness, and at the same time the mercy, of God, contrasting him with man (vers. 15-17, 23, 28-31), with idols (vers. 19, 20), and with the framework of material things (vers. 21, 22, 26), and showing his infinite superiority to each and all. In contrasting him with man, he takes occasion to bring into prominence his goodness and loving-kindness to man, to whom he imparts a portion of his own might and strength (vers. 29-31 ). Verse 12. - Who hath measured the waters? (comp. Proverbs 30:4 and Job 38:4-6). The might of God is especially shown in creation, which Isaiah assumes to be God's work. How infinitely above man must he be, who arranged in such perfection, \"by measure and number and weight\" (Wisd. 11:20), the earth, the waters, and the heavens, so proportioning each to each as to produce that admirable order and regularity which the intelligent observer cannot but note in the material universe as among its chief characteristics! In the hollow of his hand. The anthropomorphism is strong, no doubt, but softened by the preceding mention (in ver. 10) of God's \"arm,\" and by the comparison of God to a shepherd (in ver. 11). Isaiah's exalted notion of God renders him fearless with regard to anthropomorphism. And meted out heaven with the span; rather, with a span (comp. Isaiah 48:13, \"My right hand hath spanned the heavens\"). And comprehended the dust of the earth in a measure; literally, in a tierce (as in the margin). The measure intended is probably the seah, which was the third part of an ephah, and held about three gallons. The seah was \"the ordinary measure for household purposes.\" In scales... in a balance. The peles, here translated \"scales,\" is probably the steelyard, while the mozenaim is \"the balance\" or \"pair of scales\" ordinarily used for weighing. God metes out all things with measures, scales, and balances of his own, which are proportioned to his greatness.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah40:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWho hath directed the Spirit of the LORD, or being his counseller hath taught him?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 13. - Who hath directed the Spirit of the Lord? Mr. Cheyne remarks, that \"in Isaiah there is a marked tendency to hypostatize the Spirit;\" and the remark is undoubtedly a just one (see Isaiah 32:15; Isaiah 34:16; Isaiah 48:16; Isaiah 61:1, etc.). In the present place, perhaps, the introduction of \"the Spirit of the Lord\" arises out of the remembrance of the part in creation which is assigned to the Spirit in Genesis 1:2. He \"moved,\" or \"brooded,\" upon the face of the waters, and thence began the change, or series of changes, by which order was produced out of confusion. The Spirit of the Lord \"directed,\" or regulated, these changes; but who, Isaiah asks, \"directed,\" or regulated, the Spirit itself? Can it be supposed that he too had a director over him? Isaiah does not seriously doubt on this point, or \"leave it an open question.\" He makes his inquiry by way of a reductio ad absurdum. Is it not absurd to suppose that he had a director or a counsellor? He does not - here, at any rate - so far \"hypostatize the Spirit\" as to view him as a Person distinct from the Person of God the Father, working under him, and carrying out his will. Or being his counsellor hath taught him? \"The Lord by wisdom founded the earth\" (Proverbs 3:19); but he was his own counsellor. He had no adviser external to himself. The wisdom which wrought with him was his own wisdom, an essential part of the Divine essence. The evangelical prophet approaches those mysteries of God's nature which the gospel brought to light, but cannot penetrate them.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah40:14VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWith whom took he counsel, and who instructed him, and taught him in the path of judgment, and taught him knowledge, and shewed to him the way of understanding?VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah40:15VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBehold, the nations are as a drop of a bucket, and are counted as the small dust of the balance: behold, he taketh up the isles as a very little thing.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 15. - Behold, the nations are as a drop of a bucket. \"From nature,\" as Mr. Cheyne says, \"we pass to history.\" If God is so great, so apart and by himself in relation to the material universe, what is he in relation to man? What are nations, compared to him, but \"as a drop from a bucket,\" which drips from it, and is of no account? What are they, but as the small dust of the balance, which lies on it but does not disturb its equilibrium? They are absolutely \"as nothing\" (ver. 17) - vanity and emptiness, He taketh up the isles as a very little thing; literally, he taketh up islands, or perhaps lands generally. As he weighs mountains and hills in his balance (ver. 15), so he can take up in his own hands \"lands,\" or \"countries\" (Cheyne), with all their inhabitants, and do with them as seemeth him good. They are no burden to him.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah40:16VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Lebanon is not sufficient to burn, nor the beasts thereof sufficient for a burnt offering.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 16. - Lebanon is not sufficient to burn. Man may think that he must be of some account, since God has required of him sacrifice and burnt offering, from which he may suppose God to derive some satisfaction. But, the prophet says, even if man were to burn all Lebanon as firewood on God's altar, and offer there all the (clean) beasts of the entire tract, still God would be put under no obligation. Man would even then have paid less than his debt.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah40:17VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAll nations before him are as nothing; and they are counted to him less than nothing, and vanity.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 17. - All nations; rather, all the nations; i.e. all the nations of the earth put together. In ver. 15 single \"nations\" had been declared to be of no account; now the same is said of all the nations of the earth collectively. They are accounted of God as 'ephes, nothingness, and tohu, chaos or confusion.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah40:18VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTTo whom then will ye liken God? or what likeness will ye compare unto him?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 18. is more the complement of what precedes than the introduction to what follows (comp. ver. 25). If God be all that has been said of him in vers. 12-17, must he not be wholly unique and incomparable? Then, out of this, the thought arises of the strange, the poor, the mean \"likenesses\" of God, which men have in their folly set up in various times and places. It has been said that Israel in captivity did not need to be warned against idolatry, of the inclination to which the Captivity is supposed at once to have cured them (Urwick, 'Servant of Jehovah,' p. 15). But there is no evidence of this. Rather, considering the few that returned, and the many that remained behind (Joseph., 'Ant Jud.,' 11:1), we may conclude that a large number adopted the customs, religion, and general mode of life of their masters.'NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah40:19VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe workman melteth a graven image, and the goldsmith spreadeth it over with gold, and casteth silver chains.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 19. - The workman melteth a graven image; rather, the workman casteth an image (comp. Isaiah 41:7; Isaiah 44:9-17; Isaiah 46:6, 7). Israel's tendency to idolatry has been touched on in the earlier prophecies once or twice (Isaiah 2:8, 20; Isaiah 31:7); but in the later chapters idolatry is assailed with a frequency, a pungency, and a vigour that are new, and that imply a change, either in the prophet's circumstances or in his standpoint. Perhaps it is enough to suppose that, placing himself ideally among the captives, Isaiah sees that the Babylonian idolatry will be, or at any rate may be, a snare to them, and provides an antidote against the subtle poison. The special antidote which he employs is ridicule, and the first ground of his ridicule is the genesis or formation of an image. It is made by man himself, out of known material substances. Either a figure is cast in some inferior metal, and then coated with gold and finished with the graving tool, or a mere block of wood is taken and cut into shape. Can it be supposed that such things are \"likenesses\" of God, or that he is comparable to them? Casteth silver chains; as ornaments to be worn by the images, which were often dressed (see Thucyd., 2:13; Baruch 6:9-12).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah40:20VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHe that is so impoverished that he hath no oblation chooseth a tree that will not rot; he seeketh unto him a cunning workman to prepare a graven image, that shall not be moved.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 20. - He that is so impoverished, etc.; rather, he that can only make a poor offering, i.e. that cannot spend much on religion. Chooseth a tree; rather, chooseth wood - goes to the carpenter, and selects a good sound block of wood, out of which his idol shall be made. After this he has to find a skilful workman, who will carve his image for him and set it up, so that it shall not shake. As Delitzsch observes, \"The thing carries its own satire\" in the mere plain description of it. Is such a thing comparable to God?NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah40:21VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHave ye not known? have ye not heard? hath it not been told you from the beginning? have ye not understood from the foundations of the earth?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 21. - Have ye not known? Hitherto the prophet has restrained himself, and confined himself to quiet sarcasm. Now he bursts out. Is there any one so insensate, so devoid of natural reason and understanding, as not to know what has been known to all from the beginning - yea, from the foundations of the earth - by \"the light that is in them,\" viz. that God is something wholly different from this? - that he is such a One as the prophet proceeds to describe in vers. 22-24, alike above nature and above man, Lord of heaven and earth, and absolute Disposer of the fates of all men? Hath it not been told you? If ye have not known the nature of God by the light of nature, has it not come down to you by tradition? Have not your fathers told it you? Has it not been handed on by sire to son from the very foundation of the earth? The appeal is to men generally, not especially to Israel. Have ye not understood, etc.? Some omit the preposition after \"understood,\" and render the passage thus: \"Have ye not understood the foundations of the earth?\" i.e. how it was founded, or created - that its creation was God's sole act? (so the LXX., the Vulgate, Gesenius, Hitzig, Delitzsch, Knobel, Kay; but Ewald, Henderson, Weir, and Mr. Cheyne prefer the rendering of the Authorized Version).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah40:22VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTIt is he that sitteth upon the circle of the earth, and the inhabitants thereof are as grasshoppers; that stretcheth out the heavens as a curtain, and spreadeth them out as a tent to dwell in:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 22. - It is he that sitteth upon the circle of the earth; rather, above the vault of the earth; above the vault of sky which seems to arch over the earth. As grasshoppers; i.e. minute, scarcely visible (comp. Numbers 13:33). That stretcheth out the heavens as a curtain. So in Psalm 104:2, only that here the \"curtain\" is represented as one of thin gauze. The idea is common to Isaiah with Job (Job 9:8), Jeremiah (Jeremiah 10:12; Jeremiah 51:15), and Zechariah (Zechariah 12:1), and is a favourite one in these later chapters (comp. Isaiah 42:5; Isaiah 44:24; Isaiah 45:12; Isaiah 51:13). As a tent (comp. Psalm 19:4, where God is said to have set in the heavens a \"tabernacle\" - 'ohel, the word used here - for the sun).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah40:23VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThat bringeth the princes to nothing; he maketh the judges of the earth as vanity.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 23. - The princes... the judges; rather, princes, judges. The entire class of such is meant, not any special individuals (comp. Psalm 107:40; Job 12:19-21). As vanity; or, as chaos - the same word that is used in ver. 17.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah40:24VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTYea, they shall not be planted; yea, they shall not be sown: yea, their stock shall not take root in the earth: and he shall also blow upon them, and they shall wither, and the whirlwind shall take them away as stubble.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 24. - They shall not be planted... shall not be sown... shall not take root. The verbs are all of them in the past tense. Translate, have not been planted,... sown, etc. The meaning is that princes and judges of the earth are not fixed in their places, have no firm root in the soil, are easily overturned. Even if the case were different, a breath from the Almighty would, as a matter of course, dry them up (see ver. 7) and blow them away. As stubble (comp. Isaiah 5:24; Psalm 83:13).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah40:25VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTTo whom then will ye liken me, or shall I be equal? saith the Holy One.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 25. - To whom then, etc.? This is a summary, to conclude the section (vers. 19-24), as ver. 18 concludes the preceding one. If God is paramount over idols (vers. 19, 20) and over nature (ver. 22) and over humanity (vers. 23, 24), to whom can he be likened? Is he not altogether unique and incomparable? Saith the Holy One (comp. Isaiah 57:15). Isaiah's special designation of God, at once pregnant and almost peculiar (see the comment on ch. 1:4), is \"the Holy One of Israel.\" This is, here and in Isaiah 57:15, abbreviated.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah40:26VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTLift up your eyes on high, and behold who hath created these things, that bringeth out their host by number: he calleth them all by names by the greatness of his might, for that he is strong in power; not one faileth.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 26. - Lift up your eyes, etc. Once more an appeal is made to creation, as proving God's greatness. \"Lift up your eyes on high, and see who hath created these (heavens), bringing out their host (i.e. the stars) by number, or in their full number (Cheyne), and calling them all by names\" (comp. Psalm 147:4, 5, \"He telleth the number of the stars, and calleth them all by their names,\" which, however, is probably later than Isaiah). Omnipotence alone could have created the starry host. Omniscience is required to know their number and their names. The Israelites are supposed to have \"learned that the constellations had names, in Babylon\" (Cheyne, ad loc.); but a special name for each star, which the Babylonians did not give, seems to be here intended. Not one faileth; i.e. \"not one star neglects to attend the muster when God marshals the host.\" The stars are viewed as his army.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah40:27VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWhy sayest thou, O Jacob, and speakest, O Israel, My way is hid from the LORD, and my judgment is passed over from my God?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 27. - O Jacob ... O Israel (For this pleonastic combination, so characteristic of Isaiah, see Isaiah 9:8; Isaiah 10:21, 22; Isaiah 14:1; Isaiah 27:6; Isaiah 29:23, in the earlier chapters; and Isaiah 41:8; Isaiah 42:24; Isaiah 43:1, 22, 28; Isaiah 44:1, 5, 23; Isaiah 45:4; Isaiah 46:3; Isaiah 49:5, 6, etc., in the later ones.) Why sayest thou ... My way is hid? The prophet has gone back to the time when Israel is suffering all the calamities of the Captivity, instead of being on the point of emerging from it, as in vers. 9-11, and he now hears the complaints of the exiles, who think that God has forsaken them - that he does not see their \"way\" of life, or regard their sufferings. My judgment. Delitzsch and Mr. Cheyne translate \"my right,\" and understand the \"right\" of Israel to be independent of its oppressors.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah40:28VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHast thou not known? hast thou not heard, that the everlasting God, the LORD, the Creator of the ends of the earth, fainteth not, neither is weary? there is no searching of his understanding.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 28. - Hast thou not known?

Creator of the ends of the earth; i.e. \"Creator even of the remotest ends,\" and therefore of the whole earth. Fainteth not (comp. Psalm 121:3, 4). If God were for a moment to \"faint\" or \"be weary,\" to \"slumber\" or \"sleep,\" the whole fabric of nature would fail and disappear, universal chaos would set in, all moral order would cease - probably all existence, except his own, sink into nothingness. God is wholly free from whatsoever is weak or defective in man. No searching (see Job 5:9; Job 9:10; Job 11:7; Psalm 147:5; Ecclesiastes 3:11). God's ways being unsearchable, his servants must trust him to accomplish their deliverance in his own good time.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah40:29VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHe giveth power to the faint; and to them that have no might he increaseth strength.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 29. - He giveth power to the faint. So far is he from being \"faint\" himself, that he has superabundant energy to impart to any that are faint among his servants.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah40:30VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTEven the youths shall faint and be weary, and the young men shall utterly fall:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 30. - Shall faint... shall fall; rather, should even the youths faint and be weary, and should the young men utterly fall, yet they that wait upon the Lord shall renew their strength, etc. The two clauses of ver. 30 are \"concessive.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah40:31VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut they that wait upon the LORD shall renew their strength; they shall mount up with wings as eagles; they shall run, and not be weary; and they shall walk, and not faint.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 31. - They shall mount up with wings as eagles (comp.

Isaiah returns to the standpoint of Isaiah 40:9-11. A deliverer of Israel is about to appear. The nations are therefore summoned to attend, and consider the facts (ver. 1). He will carry all before him (vers 2, 3), being raised up by God (ver. 4). The nations will tremble, and seek the protection of their idol-deities (vers. 5-7). Verse 1. - Keep silence before me, O islands. God is the speaker. The \"islands,\" or maritime lands of Western Asia, are to be silent before him, pondering the facts with a view to future argument. \"Then let them speak\" (see vers. 21-29). Let the people renew their strength; rather, the peoples or the nations; i.e. the inhabitants of the maritime tracts. To judgment; i.e. to a discussion,, which shall terminate in a right verdict.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah41:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWho raised up the righteous man from the east, called him to his foot, gave the nations before him, and made him rule over kings? he gave them as the dust to his sword, and as driven stubble to his bow.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 2. - Who raised up the righteous man, etc.? rather, who raised up from the East one whom righteousness will call to his foot. It is generally agreed among moderns that the reference is to Cyrus, who is further referred to in ver. 25, in Isaiah 44:28; Isaiah 45:1-4, 13; and Isaiah 46:11. Cyrus, whether we regard him as King of Persia, or as King of Elam (Susiana), would come from a land lying east of Babylon. \"Righteousness called him to his foot\" when God, the Righteous One, made him his minister, and gave him a certain task to perform (Isaiah 44:28). Gave the nations before him; rather, gives, or will give. (On the rapid conquests of Cyrus, see Herod., 1:75-191; and comp. 'Ancient Monarchies,' vol. 4. pp. 354-377.) That he was God's instrument must be admitted by all who allow that the course of history is determined by a superintending Providence. Made him rule over kings. Mr. Cheyne translates, \"makes him trample upon kings,\" which seems to give the true sense. It was certainly not the general policy of Cyrus to establish under him a number of subject kings, but rather to rule the conquered countries by means of Persian or Median governors (see Herod., 1:153, 156; 'Transactions of the Society of Bibl. Archaeol.,' vol. 7. p. 166) He gave them as the dust to his sword, etc.; or, according to some, he maketh their sword as dust, and their bow as driven stubble. The result is the same, whichever we regard as the true construction. The prophecy tells of the ease and completeness with which Cyrus vanquished his enemies.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah41:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHe pursued them, and passed safely; even by the way that he had not gone with his feet.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 3. - He pursued them, and passed safely; rather, he shall pursue them, and shall pass on in safety. Even by the way that he had not gone with his feet; rather, a path with his feet he shall not tread. The meaning seems to be that he will dispense with customary paths, making his advance everywhere over all obstacles, by untrodden ways. Compare the frequent boasts of the Assyrian kings: \"To the recesses of the deep forests and the peaks of the difficult mountains, which had never been trodden by the foot of man, I ascended' ('Records of the Past,' vol. 5. p. 13). \"Difficult mountain chains, and inaccessible hills, which none of our kings had ever previously reached - tedious paths and unopened roads - I traversed\" (ibid., p. 16). \"The lands of Sihak, of Arda, of Ulayan, of Alluria, inaccessible mountains, impossible for the horses, and inaccessible for myself, I went through\" (ibid., vol. 7. p. 36).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah41:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWho hath wrought and done it, calling the generations from the beginning?

Assuredly not. He is my work; I, Jehovah, that have called (into being) the generations (of man) from the beginning (of the world) - I, Jehovah, the First, and with the last, am he that he has done this thing. By \"the First, and with the last\" - a favourite phrase in these later chapters (see Isaiah 45:6 and Isaiah 48:12) - seems to be meant simply \"the Eternal\" (comp. Revelation 1:8, 11, 17; Revelation 2:8; Revelation 21:6; Revelation 22:13).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah41:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe isles saw it, and feared; the ends of the earth were afraid, drew near, and came.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 5. - The isles saw it, and feared. A general terror seized the nations on the conquest of the Medes by Cyrus. Croesus of Lydia, Nabonidus of Babylon, and Amasis of Egypt, were at once drawn together by the common danger, and made alliance offensive and defensive (Herod., 1:77). The weaker tribes and peoples gave themselves up for lost. Scarcely any resistance seems to have been offered to the Persian arms by the tribes between the Halys and Indus, the Jaxartes and the Indian Ocean. Lydia and Babylon alone made a stout fight; but even these were conquered without very much difficulty. The ends of the earth... drew near; i.e. distant nations held (will hold) consultation together on the danger which threatens them. The league of Lydia, Babylon, and Egypt is the only known instance of such \"drawing near\" (see the preceding note). Isaiah anticipates marked consultations and exhortations with respect to the idol-gods, in which trust should be put; but perhaps he is scarcely serious in vers. 6, 7. Rather he is indulging his sarcastic humour at the expense of the idols and of those who put their trust in them. (For instances, however, of actual trust in particular idols, see 'Records of the Past,' vol. 4. p. 58; Herod., 5:67; 8:64,)NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah41:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThey helped every one his neighbour; and every one said to his brother, Be of good courage.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah41:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTSo the carpenter encouraged the goldsmith, and he that smootheth with the hammer him that smote the anvil, saying, It is ready for the sodering: and he fastened it with nails, that it should not be moved.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 7. - The carpenter, etc. (comp. Isaiah 40:19, 20 for the variety of workmen employed in the production of idols). Each encourages the others to manufacture a right good god. When all is done, there is, however, need of soldering, and of nails, that the wretched object may be kept erect, and not show its weakness by falling, like Dagon, upon its own threshold (1 Samuel 5:4).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah41:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut thou, Israel, art my servant, Jacob whom I have chosen, the seed of Abraham my friend.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 8-20. - A PROMISE TO ISRAEL OF GOD'S PROTECTION AND SUPPORT THROUGH THE TROUBLOUS PERIOD THAT IS APPROACHING.

The eye of the prophet travels perhaps, in part, beyond the period of the Captivity; but he is mainly bent on giving the people grounds of comfort and trust during that trying time. Verse 8. - Israel... my servant (comp. Isaiah 44:1, 2, 21; Isaiah 45:4; Isaiah 48:20; Isaiah 49:3-6, etc.). The title characterizes these later chapters, and, while standing no doubt in some special relation to the \"Servant of Jehovah\" who is the subject of Isaiah 42:1-5; Isaiah 49:5-7, etc., is perhaps mainly selected, and dwelt on, to console Israel in captivity, when servants of the King of Babylon (2 Chronicles 36:20), by the thought that their true Master was God himself, and that to him, and him only, did they really belong. Jacob whom I have chosen (comp. Isaiah 44:1). (On this \"choice,\" and the love which it implied, see Deuteronomy 7:6-8; Deuteronomy 10:15) Abraham my friend; or, Abraham that loved me. It was the special privilege of Abraham to be known as God's friend (see 2 Chronicles 20:7; James 2:23) among the Hebrews, even as he is among the Arabs to this day. The \"friendship\" intended comprised, no doubt, both an active and a passive element, but it is the active element which the word principally enforces. Abraham loved God, and showed his love by his obedience.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah41:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThou whom I have taken from the ends of the earth, and called thee from the chief men thereof, and said unto thee, Thou art my servant; I have chosen thee, and not cast thee away.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 9. - Thou whom I have taken from the ends of the earth; i.e. from Ur of the Chaldees (Mugheir in Lower Babylonia), and again from Egypt, another \"end of the earth\" compared with Palestine. The prophet views Palestine as Israel's true habitat, whatever may be its temporary abiding-place. From the chief men thereof. Most moderns translate \"from the corners thereof;\" but atsilim has the meaning of \"chief men\" in the only other place where it occurs (Exodus 24:11). And not cast thee away. Not even when in exile was Israel \"cast away.\" God's care was still extended over them.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah41:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFear thou not; for I am with thee: be not dismayed; for I am thy God: I will strengthen thee; yea, I will help thee; yea, I will uphold thee with the right hand of my righteousness.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 10. - Fear thou not. This verse is most closely connected with the two preceding. The clauses in vers. 8, 9 are one and all vocative; here the verb follows. The whole passage is one of great tenderness. I am with thee (comp. Deuteronomy 31:6, 8; and see above (vol. 1, p. 132), on the force of the word\" Immanuel\"). I will strengthen thee; rather, I have strengthened thee, or I have chosen thee (Delitzsch, Cheyne). The two other verbs are also in the past tense. While primarily they declare past favours, they may also be regarded as prophetic of future ones, since \"with God is no variableness.'NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah41:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBehold, all they that were incensed against thee shall be ashamed and confounded: they shall be as nothing; and they that strive with thee shall perish.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 11, 12. - As Israel would grow strong through God's help, so her enemies would grow weak through God's disfavour. That enemies of all kinds may be seen to be included, the designation is four times varied - \"they that are angry with thee;\" \"that are at strife with thee;\" \"that are in conflict with thee;\" \"that are at war with thee.\" The order is one of climax. Similarly, with each augmentation of the hostility there is an augmentation of the sentence of punishment - \"shall be covered with shame;\" \"shall perish;\" \"shall not be found;\" \"shall become as nothingness.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah41:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThou shalt seek them, and shalt not find them, even them that contended with thee: they that war against thee shall be as nothing, and as a thing of nought.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah41:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor I the LORD thy God will hold thy right hand, saying unto thee, Fear not; I will help thee.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 13. - I the Lord thy God will hold thy right hand. God himself will be their Strength, will personally interfere on their behalf, taking them as it were by their right hand. Saying unto thee; rather, I who say to thee.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah41:14VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFear not, thou worm Jacob, and ye men of Israel; I will help thee, saith the LORD, and thy redeemer, the Holy One of Israel.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 14. - Thou worm Jacob. Though in thyself the weakest of the weak, grovelling in the dust, a mere worm (Job 25:6; Psalm 22:6), yet thou hast no cause to fear, since God sustains thee. Ye men of Israel; rather, ye handful, Israel (Delitzsch). The term used is one of disparagement, corresponding to the \"worm\" of the parallel clause. Few and weak though they be, God's people need not fear. Thy Redeemer. The word goel, here used for the first time by Isaiah, is frequent throughout the later chapters (Isaiah 43:14; Isaiah 44:6, 24; Isaiah 47:4; Isaiah 48:17; Isaiah 49:7, 26; Isaiah 54:5, 8; Isaiah 59:20; Isaiah 60:16; Isaiah 63:16). It is used for the \"nearest of kin,\" and \"avenger of blood,\" in the Levitical Law, but has a sense similar to that of the present passage in Job 19:25; Psalm 19:14: 78:35: 103:4; Proverbs 23:11; and Jeremiah 50:34. The sense \"redeem\" belongs to the verb of which goal is the participle, in Exodus 6:6; Exodus 15:13; Leviticus 25:25, 33, 48, 49; Leviticus 27:13, 19, 21, etc. The Holy One of Israel Isaiah's favourite designation of the Almighty in his covenant relationship to Israel, used eleven times in the earlier chapters (Isaiah 1:35.), once in the middle or historical portion, and thirteen times in the later chapters (Isaiah 40-66.); only used elsewhere in Psalm 71:22; Psalm 78:41; Psalm 89:18; Jeremiah 50:29; and Psalm 51:5 (see Urwick, 'Servant of Jehovah,' pp. 36, 37).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah41:15VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBehold, I will make thee a new sharp threshing instrument having teeth: thou shalt thresh the mountains, and beat them small, and shalt make the hills as chaff.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 15. - I will make thee a new sharp threshing-instrument. Israel is to be more than sustained. Strength is to be given her to take the aggressive, and to subdue her enemies under her. She is to \"thresh them\" and \"beat them small,\" as with a threshing-instrument (comp. 2 Kings 13:7; Amos 1:3; Micah 4:13). In the literal sense, no earlier accomplishment of this prophecy can be pointed out than the time of the Maccahean war. Metaphorically, it may be said that Israel began to conquer the world when her literature became known to the Greeks through the expedition of Alexander the Great, and completed her conquest when the Roman empire succumbed to the teaching of Jesus of Nazareth. Having teeth. Threshing-instruments of the kind described are still in use in Syria (Thomson, 'The Land and the Book,' p. 539) and Asia Minor (Fellows, 'Asia Minor,' p. 70). The corn is spread out on the ground, and the machine, which is sometimes armed with sharp stones, sometimes with saws, is dragged ever it.

God was able to make of this \"wilderness a standing water, and water-springs of the dry ground\" (Psalm 107:35), and he promises to do so (ver. 18). The soul that longs for him, that thirsts after him, feeling that it dwells \"in a barren and dry land, where no water is\" (Psalm 63:1), shall be relieved and satisfied by a revelation of God's presence, and an outpouring of his grace unusually copious and abundant. God's grace is shadowed out under the two similitudes of water and verdure, as in Isaiah 35:7, and, to some extent, in Isaiah 30:23-25. Verse 17. - The poor and needy; i.e. primarily, Israel in captivity; but secondarily, also, the \"poor in spirit,\" and those that feel the need of God's grace, everywhere and at all times.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah41:18VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTI will open rivers in high places, and fountains in the midst of the valleys: I will make the wilderness a pool of water, and the dry land springs of water.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 18. - I will open rivers in high places (comp.

The abundance is indicated by the fourfold designation of the water-supply, as coming fromNEWLINENEWLINE(1) rivers;NEWLINENEWLINE(2) fountains (or wells);NEWLINENEWLINE(3) pools; andNEWLINENEWLINE(4) springs (comp. vers. 11, 12).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah41:19VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTI will plant in the wilderness the cedar, the shittah tree, and the myrtle, and the oil tree; I will set in the desert the fir tree, and the pine, and the box tree together:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 19. - I will plant in the wilderness the cedar, etc. The \"glory of Lebanon,\" the \"excellency of Carmel and Sharon\" (Isaiah 35:2), shall be given to the \"wilderness,\" wherein Israel dwells. The trees named are the choicest of Syria and Palestine, viz. the cedar (erez). the great glory of Libanus; the acacia (shittah), abundant in the Jordan valley; the myrtle (hadas),whieh grew on the hills about Jerusalem (Nehemiah 8:15); the olive, cultivated over the whole country; the fir (berosh), or juniper. a product of Lebanon (2 Chronicles 2:8); the plane (tidhar), a tree far from uncommon in Coele-syria, sometimes growing to a great size; and the sherbin (teasshur), a sort of cedar, remarkable for the upward tendency of its branches. The list of names shows a writer familiar with the Palestinian region, but not familiar with Babylonia.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah41:20VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThat they may see, and know, and consider, and understand together, that the hand of the LORD hath done this, and the Holy One of Israel hath created it.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 20. - That they may see, etc. The change would be such that those who experienced it could not fail to recognize \"Jehovah, the Holy One of Israel,\" as its Author.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah41:21VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTProduce your cause, saith the LORD; bring forth your strong reasons, saith the King of Jacob.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 21-29. - JEHOVAH'S CONTROVERSY WITH THE NATIONS AND THEIR IDOL-GODS. The argument is now taken up from vers. 1-4. Jehovah and his worshippers are on the one side; the idol-gods and their votaries on the other. The direct challenge, however, is given by Jehovah himself to the idols:NEWLINENEWLINE1. What predictions of their own can they bring forward as proofs of supernatural knowledge?NEWLINENEWLINE2. What indications can they give of power either to do good or to do evil (vers. 22, 23)? If they can do neither, they are vanity (ver. 24). Jehovah has both reared up Cyrus he and he only - and has announced the good tidings to his people (vers. 25-27). No such announcement has been made by the idol-gods; they are therefore mere \"wind and confusion\" (vers. 28, 29). Verse 21. - Produce your cause. The nations had been told to \"draw near\" - to \"keep silence\" while God spoke - and \"then to speak\" (ver. 1). Now the time for them to speak is come, and they are challenged to \"produce\" and plead \"their cause.\" Your strong reasons; literally, your bulwarks, or defences. Saith the King of Jacob. The king and tutelary god of the nation, Israel, really holding the position that the idol-gods were regarded as holding towards the peoples that worshipped them. The \"kingly\" character of the idol-gods was indicated in such names as Moloch (equivalent to \"king\"), Melkarth (equivalent to \"king of the city\"), Adrammelech (equivalent to \"glorious king\"), Baal (equivalent to \"lord\"), Adonis (equivalent to \"my lord\"), etc.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah41:22VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTLet them bring them forth, and shew us what shall happen: let them shew the former things, what they be, that we may consider them, and know the latter end of them; or declare us things for to come.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 22. - Let them... show us what will happen. God claims that the power of predicting the future is his own inalienable prerogative. He defies the idol-gods and their votaries to give any clear prediction of future events. No doubt the claim to possess the power was made very generally among the idolatrous nations, who almost universally practised divination, and in many cases possessed oracles. But it was a false claim, based upon fraud and cunning, which deceived men as often as dependence was placed upon it (Herod., 1:53, 91) and landed them in misfortune. The former things... things for to come. Some commentators regard \"the former things\" as things actually past - \"the beginnings of history, for instance, which to the heathen nations were wrapped in darkness\" (Kay); but it seems better, on the whole, to understand (with Vitringa, Stier, Hahn, Cheyne, and Delitzsch) by \"the former things\" those in the immediate future, by \"things for to come\" those about to happen in remoter times. The former are, of course, much the easier to predict, since they fall to some extent within the domain of human foresight; the latter are more difficult; but the idol-gods are challenged to produce either the one or the other. What they be. A definite and clear statement is required to preclude such vague and ambiguous utterances as the heathen oracles delighted to put forth. That we may consider them (or, lay them to heart), and know the latter end of them; i.e. compare them with the event, when the time comes.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah41:23VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTShew the things that are to come hereafter, that we may know that ye are gods: yea, do good, or do evil, that we may be dismayed, and behold it together.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 23. - Yea, do good, or do evil. Here the proof required of the idol-gods is changed. If they cannot prophesy, can they effect anything? Can they do either good or harm? Let them show this. It is a plain \"abatement\" from the first demand, and therefore properly introduced by \"yea\" (aph); comp. 1 Kings 8:27. That we may be dismayed; i.e. rather, perhaps, that we may look to it, or examine it; i.e. see if yon have really shown a power of doing anything.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah41:24VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBehold, ye are of nothing, and your work of nought: an abomination is he that chooseth you.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 24. - A pause may be supposed between vers. 23 and 24, during which the idol-gods are given the opportunity of \"bringing, forth their strong reasons,\" and, in one way or other, proving their Divinity. But they are stricken dumb; they say nothing. Accordingly, \"judgment goes against them by default\" (Cheyne), and Jehovah breaks out upon them with words of contempt and contumely, Behold, ye are of nothing, etc. \"Ye are utterly vain and futile.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah41:25VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTI have raised up one from the north, and he shall come: from the rising of the sun shall he call upon my name: and he shall come upon princes as upon morter, and as the potter treadeth clay.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 25. - It remains for Jehovah to plead his own cause, to vindicate his own Divinity. He adduces, as proof of his power in action, the fact of his raising up Cyrus; as proof of his ability to predict, the fact that he has announced his coming. One from the north... from the rising of the sun. Both as a Persian, and as King of Elam, Cyrus might be considered to come from the east. In fact, however, when he attacked Babylon, he fell upon it mainly from the north. After his conquest of Astyages (Istivegu), he made Ecbatana his capital (Herod., 1:153); and it was from this comparatively northern city that he directed his attack upon Nabonidus. His march lay by way of Arbela ('Transactions of the Society of Bibl. Archaeol.,' vol. 7. p. 159) and Sippara (ibid., p. 165), through the district called Akkad to the Chaldean capital. Herodotus agrees with the monuments in bringing him to Babylon from the north. Shall he call upon my Name; or, shall he. proclaim my Name. (For the actual proclamation of Jehovah's Name by Cyros, see Ezra 1:3; and note especially the phrase, \"He [i.e. Jehovah] is the God.\") Recent discoveries have raised the suspicion that Cyrus was a eyncretist, who was willing to accept the chief god of any nation as identical with his own Ormuzd. But it is to be borne in 'mind that the document which has produced this impression is one issued by the priestly authorities of Babylon in their own language, and may have been quite unknown to the Persian court. Cyrus may have been a better Zoroastrian than he is represented by the priests of Merodach. The Zoroastrian religion was, as Delitzsch observes, \"nearest to the Jewish religion of all the systems of heathenism\" (see . Ancient Monarchies,' vol. 3. pp. 93-117; and comp. Pusey, 'Lectures on Daniel,' pp. 530-550). He shall come upon princes as upon mortar; i.e. he shall tread them underfoot, mortar being commonly mixed with the feet, as was also clay for bricks and pottery (Herod., 2:36). The chief\" princes\" whom Cyrus is known to have conquered were Astyages of Media, Croesus of Lydia, and Nabenidus of Babylon. He was studiously mild in his treatment of royal captives, but naturally deprived them of all power.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah41:26VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWho hath declared from the beginning, that we may know? and beforetime, that we may say, He is righteous? yea, there is none that sheweth, yea, there is none that declareth, yea, there is none that heareth your words.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 26. - Who hath declared from the beginning? Which of the idol-gods has announced the coming of a conqueror? If any, we on Jehovah's side are quite willing to acknowledge it, and to say, He is righteous; or rather, he is right. But, in fact, there is none of them that showeth, none that declareth - no one has heard of any such announcement as delivered by any of them.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah41:27VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe first shall say to Zion, Behold, behold them: and I will give to Jerusalem one that bringeth good tidings.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 27. - The first shall say to Zion, Behold, behold them; rather, the first has said. By \"the first\" must certainly be meant Jehovah - \" the First, and with the last\" of ver. 4. He has already announced to Zion her deliverance (see Isaiah 40:9-11; Isaiah 41:2, etc.). I will give to Jerusalem one that bringeth good tidings. Perhaps Isaiah himself (Grotius, Stier, Delitzsch). Perhaps some prophet of the Captivity, as Daniel, who \"knew by books\" when the Captivity was drawing to a close (Daniel 9:2), and may be supposed to have announced the good tidings to the other exiles.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah41:28VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor I beheld, and there was no man; even among them, and there was no counseller, that, when I asked of them, could answer a word.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 28. - For I beheld. \"Jehovah once more looks round to see if any of the idols possess an ability to prophesy, but in vain\" (Cheyne). He finds no counsellor, i.e. no prophet, among them. Hence the final \"outburst of scorn\" in ver. 29, which, however, is directed primarily against the idol-worshippers, and, only through them, against the idols.NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah41:29VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBehold, they are all vanity; their works are nothing: their molten images are wind and confusion.VERSEENDNEWLINE","Isa.42":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah42:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBehold my servant, whom I uphold; mine elect, in whom my soul delighteth; I have put my spirit upon him: he shall bring forth judgment to the Gentiles.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 1-8. - ANNOUNCEMENT OF THE SERVANT OF THE LORD, AND THE WORK WHICH HE WILL PERFORM. There are comparatively few who deny that, in this place at any rate, the \"Servant of the Lord\" is the Messiah. (So the Targum on the passage; so Abar-barnel; so, among moderns, Oehler, Delitzsch, and Mr. Cheyne.) The portraiture has \"so strong an individuality and such marked personal features, that it cannot possibly be a mere personified collective;\" and it goes so \"infinitely beyond anything of which a man was ever capable that it can only be the future Christ\" (Delitzsch). It may be added that St. Matthew (Matthew 12:17-21) distinctly applies the passage to our Lord. Verse 1. - Behold. \"Behold,\" as Mr. Cheyne says, \"invites the attention of the world - both of the Jews and of the nations - to a new revelation.\" It looks back to the similar expression of vers. 24 and 29 of the preceding chapter, which draw down the curtain upon the idol-gods, while this \"behold\" reveals One who is to occupy their place, and to be a worthy object of the worship of mankind, My Servant; i.e. my true and perfect servant, utterly obedient (John 4:34; Hebrews 3:2); not, like Israel, my rebellious and faithless servant; not, even, like my prophets, yielding an imperfect obedience, Whom I uphold. \"As the Father hath life in himself, so hath he given to the Son to have life in himself\" (John 5:26). As the fount or origin of Divinity (πηγὴ Θεότητος), the Father supports and sustains even the Son and the Spirit. Mine Elect (comp. 1 Peter 2:6). Christ was \"chosen\" from all eternity in God's counsels to the great work of man's redemption, and to be the Mediator between God and man. I have put my Spirit upon him (see Isaiah 11:2; Isaiah 61:1; and for the fulfilment, comp. Luke 2:40; Luke 3:22; Luke 4:18-21; Luke 3:34). He shall bring forth judgment to the Gentiles; i.e. \"he shall publish,\" or \"cause to be published, to the Gentiles, the true Law of God - religion on its practical side.\" The publication of Christianity throughout all the world has abundantly fulfilled this promise or prophecy. The call of the Gentiles had been already declared by Isaiah in his earlier preaching (ch. 2:2; 11:10; 19:22-25; 25:6; 27:13, etc.).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah42:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHe shall not cry, nor lift up, nor cause his voice to be heard in the street.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 2. - He shall not cry, nor lift up. Supply, after \"lift up,\" \"his voice\" from the next clause. His methods shall be quiet and gentle. He shall not seek to recommend his teaching by clamour or noisy demonstrations. There shall be a marked unobtrusiveness in all his doings (comp. Matthew 8:4; Matthew 9:30; Matthew 12:15; Matthew 14:13; John 5:13; John 6:15; John 7:3, 4; John 8:59; John 10:40, etc.).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah42:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTA bruised reed shall he not break, and the smoking flax shall he not quench: he shall bring forth judgment unto truth.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 3. - A bruised reed shall he not break. Egypt was compared to a \"bruised reed\" by Sennacherib (Isaiah 36:6), as being untrustworthy and destitute of physical strength; but here the image represents the weak and depressed in spirit, the lowly and dejected. Christ would deal tenderly with such, not violently. Smoking flax shall he not quench; rather, the wick which burns dimly (margin) he shall not quench. Where the flame of devotion burns at all, however feebly and dimly, Messiah will take care not to quench it. Rather he will tend it, and trim it, and give it fresh oil, and cause it to burn more brightly. He shall bring forth judgment unto truth. But with all this tenderness, this \"economy,\" this allowance for the shortcomings and weaknesses of individuals, he will be uncompromising in his assertion of absolute justice and absolute truth. He will sanction nothing short of the very highest standard of moral purity and excellence. (For an instance of the combination of extreme tenderness with unswerving maintenance of an absolute standard, see John 8:8-11.)NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah42:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHe shall not fail nor be discouraged, till he have set judgment in the earth: and the isles shall wait for his law.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 4. - He shall not fail nor be discouraged; literally, he will not burn dimly nor be bruised. He will himself show no signs of that weakness which he will compassionate in others. As a \"Light\" (Luke 2:32; John 1:4-9), he will burn brightly and strongly; as a Reed, or Rod, he will be firm and unbroken. Till he have set judgment in the earth; i.e. till he has succeeded in establishing true religion upon the earth (compare the last clause of ver. 1). The isles; or, the countries (comp. Isaiah 41:1, 5). Shall wait for his Law; or, shall long for his Law. Yakhal is \"to wait longingly.\" It is, as Delitzsch observes, \"an actual fact that the cry for redemption runs through the whole human race.\" They are possessed by \"an earnest longing, the ultimate object of which is, however unconsciously, the Servant of Jehovah, and his instruction from Zion\" ('Comment. on Isaiah,' vol. 2. p. 177).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah42:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThus saith God the LORD, he that created the heavens, and stretched them out; he that spread forth the earth, and that which cometh out of it; he that giveth breath unto the people upon it, and spirit to them that walk therein:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 5. - Thus saith God the Lord; literally, thus saith the (One) God, Jehovah. The entire utterance, vers. 1-4, is the utterance of God; but, as that fact is gathered by inference, not asserted, the prophet suddenly stops, and makes a new beginning. It must be made perfectly clear that the announcement of the \"Servant of the Lord\" and his mission are from the Almighty; and so we have the solemn announcement of the present verse. He that created the heavens, etc. (comp. Isaiah 40:12, 22). The earth, and that which cometh out of it; i.e. all that the earth produces - gold, and silver, and precious stones, and corn, and wine, and luscious fruits, and lovely flowers - all that sustains life, and all that makes life delightful - nay more, life itself - the breath and the spirit that make men living beings.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah42:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTI the LORD have called thee in righteousness, and will hold thine hand, and will keep thee, and give thee for a covenant of the people, for a light of the Gentiles;VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 6. - I the Lord have called thee in righteousness. The \"Servant of Jehovah\" is addressed. God has \"called\" him; i.e. appointed him to his mediatorial office \"in righteousness,\" in accordance with the righteous purpose which he has entertained towards his fallen creatures from the beginning of the world. And will give thee for a Covenant of the people (comp. Isaiah 49:8). The covenant between God and his people being in Christ, it is quite consistent with Hebrew usage to transfer the term to Christ himself, in whom the covenant was, as it were, embodied. So Christ is called \"our Salvation\" and \"our Peace,\" and again, \"our Redemption\" and \"our Life.\" This is the ordinary tone of Hebrew poetry, which rejoices in personification and embodiment. A prose writer would have said that the Servant of the Lord would be given as the Mediator of a covenant between Jehovah and his people. For a light of the Gentiles (comp. Isaiah 49:6; Isaiah 51:4).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah42:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTTo open the blind eyes, to bring out the prisoners from the prison, and them that sit in darkness out of the prison house.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 7. - To open the blind eyes. The Messiah was to cure both physical and. spiritual blindness (see Isaiah 29:18; Isaiah 32:3; Isaiah 35:5, etc.). Here it is spiritual blindness that is specially intended, as appears both by the symbolic language of the two conjoined clauses, and by the comment of vers. 16-19. To bring out the prisoners from the prison; rather, to bring out prisoners. To deliver from the bondage of sin such as are its slaves, and shut up in its prison-houses. The promise is general, but, like all spiritual promises, conditioned by the willingness of those who are its objects to avail themselves of it. Them that sit in darkness (comp. Isaiah 9:2).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah42:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTI am the LORD: that is my name: and my glory will I not give to another, neither my praise to graven images.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 8. - I am the Lord; rather, I the Lord. The sense runs on from the preceding verses: \"I, the Lord, will do all this, I who am all that the Name\" Jehovah' signifies - self-existent, eternal, self-sufficing, independent, omnipotent, and therefore unique, one whose glory cannot be shared with any other being that exists - least of all with images, which are mere vanity and nothingness.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah42:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBehold, the former things are come to pass, and new things do I declare: before they spring forth I tell you of them.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 9-17. - ANNOUNCEMENT OF THE COMING DELIVERANCE OF ISRAEL FROM BABYLON, AND CALL ON THE NATIONS FOR A SONG OF PRAISE AND JUBILATION. Jehovah is still the speaker. He begins by promising a new revelation (ver. 9). Then, before the revelation is made, he calls upon the nations - especially those in the vicinity of Palestine - to rejoice at what is about to happen (vers. 10-12). After this he proceeds to make the announcement promised in ver. 9 - an announcement that he is about to deliver his people (ver. 16) and to execute vengeance on their enemies (vers. 13-15 and 17). Verse 9. - Behold, the former things are come to pass; i.e. former prophecies have been fulfilled. Israel has been led lute captivity, and in her captivity has suffered grievous things. The reference is, perhaps, especially to such prophecies as Isaiah 39:5-7. And new things do I declare (comp. Isaiah 43:19). The voluntary restoration of a captive people to their own land by the power to which they were subject, and which could compel their services, was emphatically a \"new thing\" in the world's history. How unwilling the sovereign power was ordinarily to lose such services may be seen by the narrative in Exodus (Exodus 5-14.), and again by the account which Herodotus gives (1:73, 74) of the ground of quarrel between Alyattes and Cyaxares. Before they spring forth; or, shoot forth. The metaphor is one taken from the vegetable world (comp. Isaiah 43:19; Isaiah 45:8).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah42:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTSing unto the LORD a new song, and his praise from the end of the earth, ye that go down to the sea, and all that is therein; the isles, and the inhabitants thereof.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 10. - Sing unto the Lord a new song. The call for a \"new song\" is based upon the ground that the mercy vouchsafed was a \"new\" one (see ver. 9). The expression is frequent in the Psalms (Psalm 33:3; Psalm 96:1; Psalm 98:1; Psalm 144:9; Psalm 149:1). His praise from the end of the earth; i.e. \"let his praise be sung by all the inhabitants of the earth to its remotest bounds.\" The sea. Sea and land are called upon equally to proclaim God's praise; the sea, \"and its fulness\" (margin) - those who frequent it in ships, and those who dwell on its shores and islands. The last clause, \"the isles and the inhabitants thereof,\" is exegetical of the preceding one - \" all that is therein.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah42:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTLet the wilderness and the cities thereof lift up their voice, the villages that Kedar doth inhabit: let the inhabitants of the rock sing, let them shout from the top of the mountains.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 11. - The wilderness and the cities thereof. The desert had its cities, built on some more or less fertile oases, where at any rate water was procurable. Instances of such cities are Tudmor, Petra, Kadesh (Numbers 20:1). Its villages were probably collections of tents, which were moved from time to time, since the Beni-Kedar were nomads (ch. 21:16; Psalm 120:5). The call is upon both the stationary and the wandering inhabitants of the Syro-Arabian desert to join in the song of praise. The inhabitants of the rock; rather, the iahabitants of Sela, or Petra, the rock-city, which was the capital of Idumaea, or Edom (see the comment on ch. 16. l). It is assumed that the return of the Israelites to their land ought to be a subject of rejoicing to all their neighbours.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah42:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTLet them give glory unto the LORD, and declare his praise in the islands.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 12. - Let them give glory unto the Lord... in the islands; i.e. \"let those who are in the islands,\" or the maritime tracts, \"give glory to God\" - a repetition of the last clause of ver. 10. The persistency with which the islands, or the maritime tracts of the west, are mentioned (Isaiah 41:1, 5; Isaiah 42:10, 12; Isaiah 49:1, etc.) may perhaps be accounted for by the fact that Christianity was to obtain its earliest and its most enduring triumphs in these regions.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah42:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe LORD shall go forth as a mighty man, he shall stir up jealousy like a man of war: he shall cry, yea, roar; he shall prevail against his enemies.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 13. - The Lord shall go forth. The exhortation to \"sing unto the Lord a new song\" ends with ver. 12, and now the reason or groundwork for the exhortation has to be declared. God is about to make one of the great manifestations of his power upon the earth - to \"go forth\" against his enemies, and destroy and devour, and easily prevail against them - not, however, simply in the way of punishment and vengeance, but with a further merciful object. He will punish Babylon, that he may deliver Israel. He has promised not to forsake his people (Isaiah 41:17). He is now about to give effect to his promise by a \"new\" and strange deliverance. He \"will bring his people by a way that they knew not, and lead them in paths that they have not known\" (ver. 16). It has been said that \"in effect it is the day of judgment which is here described\" (Cheyne); but this seems to be only so far true as every manifestation of God's wrath towards his enemies is a foreshadowing of the great and awful day. The event directly in view is the destruction of the Babylonian power by the irresistible arms of Cyrus. Hence the allusion to idolaters and images in ver. 17. As a mighty man... like a man of war. (For similar anthropomorpbisms, see Exodus 15:3; Psalm 24:8.) He shall stir up jealousy; i.e. his own jealousy. God is \"a jealous God\" (Exodus 20:5), so much SO that his very \"name is Jealous\" (Exodus 34:14). He is jealous for his own honour (supra, ver. 8), and jealous also for his people's honour and reputation and happiness. Occasionally he allows his jealousy to slumber (comp. Acts 12:30, \"The times of this ignorance God winked at\"); and this he had now done for some fifty or sixty years, since his people were carried into captivity. But the time of acquiescence has gone by - he is about to waken up his \"smouldering jealousy, and stir it, till it burns up into a bright flame\" (Delitzsch). He shall cry, yea, roar; rather, yea, shout; i.e. utter his battle-cry with a clear, loud voice.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah42:14VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTI have long time holden my peace; I have been still, and refrained myself: now will I cry like a travailing woman; I will destroy and devour at once.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 14. - I have long time holden my peace; literally, for an eternity. God's love for his people is forcibly expressed by his saying that he has felt it \"an eternity\" - though it was but some five or six decades - while he was waiting for his chastisement to have such due effect as would allow of his bringing it to an end, and showing them mercy. He has chafed, as it were, under the necessity of inaction, and has with difficulty refrained himself. Now he will refrain no longer. A travailing woman. A woman in her travail, after long endurance, at last gives free vent to her natural feelings, and utters loud cries (compare the preceding verse). I will destroy and devour at once (so Gesenius, Kay, and the ancient versions). But the bulk of modern commentators render, \"I will pant and gasp,\" as does a travailing woman.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah42:15VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTI will make waste mountains and hills, and dry up all their herbs; and I will make the rivers islands, and I will dry up the pools.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 15. - I will make waste mountains and hills. The result of God's \"stirring up his jealousy,\" and giving a free vent to his feelings, will be the destruction of the great and mighty ones of the earth (comp. Isaiah 2:14). These are probably, in this place, the Babylonian kings and nobles. Dry up all their herbs; i.e. turn Babylonia, temporarily, into a desert. Make the rivers islands, and dry up the pools. Invert the established order of things - turn the rivers into dry land, and empty the reservoirs. There is, perhaps, some allusion to those dealings with the river-beds, which the Greek historians ascribe to Cyrus (Herod., 1:189, 191; Xen., 'Cyrop.,' 7:5, § 10), and which are not disproved by the fact that the one native account of the capture of Babylon by Cyrus, which has come down to us, makes no mention of them.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah42:16VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd I will bring the blind by a way that they knew not; I will lead them in paths that they have not known: I will make darkness light before them, and crooked things straight. These things will I do unto them, and not forsake them.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 16. - I will bring the blind by a way that they knew not. \"The blind\" here can only be captive Israel, still dim-sighted from the effect of its old sins against light, and therefore greatly needing God's guidance. God promises to \"bring them\" out of captivity \"by a way not hitherto known to them\" - the way of voluntary release by the favour of a new king (see the comment on ver. 9). I will make darkness light before them; either, I will illuminate with rays of light and hope the dark and cheerless life that they have been leading (Delitzsch), or, I will throw light upon that dark future which has hitherto stretched before them, and allow them to penetrate its obscurity, and see what is about to happen. Crooked things; rather, rough places; i.e. difficulties of any and every kind. Straight; rather, smooth, level, flat,. These things will I do unto them, and not forsake them. Dr. Kay translates, \"These things have I done, and have not forsaken them;\" Mr. Cheyne, \"These are the things that I will do, and will not let them slip;\" Delitzsch, \"These are the things that I carry out and do not leave.\" According to the two latter renderings, the clause is a mere solemn confirmation of the previous promises.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah42:17VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThey shall be turned back, they shall be greatly ashamed, that trust in graven images, that say to the molten images, Ye are our gods.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 17. - They shall be turned back, etc. While the people of God are led by God's hand through new paths, and are illumined with abundant light, and have their difficulties smoothed away from before them. their idolatrous oppressors will be \"turned back\" or suffer defeat, and be put to shame, finding no help from their idols, whose powerlessness will be openly shown, to the utter confusion of their votaries.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah42:18VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHear, ye deaf; and look, ye blind, that ye may see.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 18-25. - ADDRESS TO CAPTIVE ISRAEL, CALLING UPON THEM TO TURN TO GOD, AND REMINDING THEM THAT THEY HAVE DESERVED THEIR AFFLICTIONS. By some critics the earlier verses of this passage (vers. 19-21) are regarded as having reference to the \"Servant of the Lord\" depicted in vers. 1-7, and as calling on the captive Jews to consider his voluntary humiliation, and the object of it. But this view seems to be strained. It requires \"deaf\" and \"blind' to be taken in completely different senses in the two consecutive verses, 18 and 19. Probably Delitzsch and Mr. Cheyne are right in taking the whole passage of captive Israel, and especially of that \"outer circle\" which was least deserving of God's favour and most open to rebuke and reproach. These \"blind\" and \"deaf\" ones are warned that it is high time for them to unclose their eyes and open their ears, and are reminded that all their recent and present sufferings arise from their former \"blindness\" and disobedience. Verse 18. - Hear, ye deaf. The \"deaf\" are not absolutely without hearing, nor the \"blind\" absolutely without sight. They can \"hear\" and \"see,\" if they choose to do so. When they do not see, it is because they \"wink with their eyes\" (Matthew 13:15); when they do not hear, it is because, like the deaf adder, they \"stop their ears\" (Psalm 58:4). This, at any rate, is the case with the majority. There may be some who have deadened their moral vision altogether, and have no longer any \"ears to hear.\" God, however, addresses the mass of Israel as still possessed of moral discernment, if they will but use it, and calls upon them to wake up out of sleep - to \"hear\" and \"see.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah42:19VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWho is blind, but my servant? or deaf, as my messenger that I sent? who is blind as he that is perfect, and blind as the LORD'S servant?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 19. - Who is blind, but my servant? or deaf, as my messenger? God's original \"servant\" and \"messenger\" to the nations was his people Israel. It was only through their default that he needed to send another and truer messenger. He now asks, having regard to their opportunities, who are so blind and deaf as they are? The object of the question is to wake a feeling of shame in the hearts of those who are not shameless among the Israelites. That I sent; rather, whom I will send. Israel's mediatorial office was not yet over. They were still, for above five hundred years, to be God's messenger to the nations. As he that is perfect; rather, as he that receives reward from me (see Proverbs 11:31; Proverbs 13:13). The word used is connected etymologically with the Arabic muslim (our \"Moslem\"); but it does not appear to have had the sense of \"surrender\" or \"submission\" in Hebrew.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah42:20VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTSeeing many things, but thou observest not; opening the ears, but he heareth not.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 20. - Seeing many things, but, etc. Israel had \"seen many things;\" i.e. passed through a long experience, but not profited by it - not been \"observant,\" as they should have been. They had had their ears open in a certain sense, and heard the words that the prophets addressed to them, but had not taken in their true import. (The mixture of persons is like that in Isaiah 1:29 and Isaiah 14:30.)NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah42:21VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe LORD is well pleased for his righteousness' sake; he will magnify the law, and make it honourable.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 21. - The Lord is well pleased; rather, the Lord was pleased, or it pleased the Lord. For his righteousness' sake; \"because of his own perfect righteousness.\" He will magnify the Law; rather, to magnify the Law - to set it forth in its greatness and its glory before his people. It is not the original giving of the Law at Sinai only that is meant, but also its constant inculcation by a long series of prophets. Israel's experience (ver. 29) had included all this; but they had not profited by the instruction addressed to them.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah42:22VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut this is a people robbed and spoiled; they are all of them snared in holes, and they are hid in prison houses: they are for a prey, and none delivereth; for a spoil, and none saith, Restore.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 22. - But this is a people, etc.; i.e. yet, notwithstanding all that has been done for it, see the condition into which this people has brought itself. For their sins, here they are in Babylonia, robbed and spoiled - i.e., suffering oppression and wrong - snared in holes, or taken in their enemies' pits (Psalm 119:85), and, some of them, hid in prison-houses (see 2 Kings 25:27), expiating by their punishments the long series of their offences.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah42:23VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWho among you will give ear to this? who will hearken and hear for the time to come?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 23. - Who among you will give ear? Surely there are some among you, less hardened than the rest, who will take advantage of my warning, and repent at this, the eleventh hour. God's arm was straitened; the people could not be delivered out of captivity unless they ceased in large numbers to be \"blind\" and \"deaf\" - unless they listened to the prophet's words, and profited by them.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah42:24VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWho gave Jacob for a spoil, and Israel to the robbers? did not the LORD, he against whom we have sinned? for they would not walk in his ways, neither were they obedient unto his law.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 24. - Jacob... Israel (comp. Isaiah 40:27; Isaiah 41:8, 14; Isaiah 43:1, etc.), He against whom we have sinned. The prophet identifies himself with his people in loving sympathy, just as Daniel does in Daniel 9:5-15, and Ezra in Ezra 9:6-15, of their respective books (comp. also Isaiah 59:9-13).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah42:25VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTTherefore he hath poured upon him the fury of his anger, and the strength of battle: and it hath set him on fire round about, yet he knew not; and it burned him, yet he laid it not to heart.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 25. - Therefore he hath poured upon him... the strength of battle; i.e. for this cause, on account of their iniquities, did God bring upon his people the scourge of foreign war, and allow the Babylonians to waste Judaea, to destroy Jerusalem, and to lead into captivity the entire nation (comp. 2 Chronicles 36:14-17). It hath set him on fire; rather, it (i.e. the war)set him on fire. The reference is, perhaps, especially to the burning of Jerusalem by Nebuzar-adan (2 Kings 25:9); but the phrase will cover also the general devastation of the land both before and after this event (Jeremiah 39-42.), He knew not; rather, he took no notice; he did not change his ways on account of the chastisement. The prophet's view is that Israel, as a whole, was not greatly bettered by the Captivity, at any rate up to the time which he takes for his standpoint, and at which he supposes him. self to be addressing them.NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINE","Isa.43":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah43:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut now thus saith the LORD that created thee, O Jacob, and he that formed thee, O Israel, Fear not: for I have redeemed thee, I have called thee by thy name; thou art mine.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 1-7. - A RENEWED PROMISE TO ISRAEL OF PROTECTION AND DELIVERANCE. Severe rebuke (Isaiah 42:18-25) is followed, as so often in Isaiah (Isaiah 1:25-27; Isaiah 4:2-6; Isaiah 9:1-16, etc.), by comfort and consolation. Israel is assured that God has not cast him off, and promised the comfort of the Divine presence during the existing tribulation (ver. 2), and. a speedy restoration to Palestine (vers. 3-7). The scattered Israelites will be brought together from all quarters by the Divine omnipoteney. Verse 1. - But now. The words mark the strong contrast between the closing passage of the preceding chapter and the opening paragraph of the present one. Israel had undergone a severe punishment for his sins; he is still suffering, but now there is going to be an entire change. He is to be protected and delivered. Created thee... formed. thee redeemed thee... called thee by thy name. An ascending series of benefits. First, creation, like that of formless matter out of nought; then, formation, or putting of the formless matter into shape; thirdly, redemption, or making them all his own; lastly, calling them by their name, and so conferring on them a proud and enviable distinction. On this fourfold ground God claims Israel as his own.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah43:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWhen thou passest through the waters, I will be with thee; and through the rivers, they shall not overflow thee: when thou walkest through the fire, thou shalt not be burned; neither shall the flame kindle upon thee.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 2. - Through the waters... through the rivers; i.e. through troubles of any kind (comp. Psalm 66:12, \"We went through fire and through water: but thou broughtest us out into a wealthy place\"). There were, perhaps, special troubles to be endured connected with the final Babylonian struggle. There were certainly others connected with the tedious and dangerous journey from Babylonia to Palestine (Ezra 8:22, 31). There were others, again, after the Holy Land was reached, arising out of the jealousy and ill will of neighbouring nations (Ezra 4. and 5; Nehemiah 4-6.). Neither shall the flame kindle upon thee. The literal fulfilment in the persons of the \"three children\" (Daniel 3:27) will be obvious to every reader. But the prophecy has, no doubt, a far wider scope.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah43:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor I am the LORD thy God, the Holy One of Israel, thy Saviour: I gave Egypt for thy ransom, Ethiopia and Seba for thee.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 3. - The Holy One of Israel (comp. Isaiah 41:14, 20, with the comment). Thy Saviour. He who had saved them front Pharaoh (Exodus 14:23-31), from Jabin (Judges 4.), from Midian (Judges 7.), from the Philistines (2 Samuel 8:1), from Zerah (2 Chronicles 14:9-15), from Sennacherib (Isaiah 37:36). The term is first used of God by David in 2 Samuel 22:3 and Psalm 106:21 (if that psalm be Davidical). It is also applied to God once in Jeremiah (Jeremiah 14:8), and once in Hosea (Hosea 13:4). With Isaiah, in these later chapters it is a favourite epithet, being used of God no fewer than eight times (see ver. 11; Isaiah 45:15, 21; Isaiah 47:15; Isaiah 49:26; Isaiah 60:16; Isaiah 63:8) With his eye fixed on the deliverance of Israel out of the double captivity of sin and of Babylon, he naturally had much before him this aspect of Jehovah. I gave Egypt for thy ransom, etc.; rather, I have given; that is to say, \"In my counsels I have already assigned to the Persians, as compensation for their letting thee go free, the broad countries of Egypt, Ethiopia, and Seba.\" Even the latest date assigned by sceptical critics to \"the Second Isaiah\" would make this a most remarkable prophecy. Egypt was not reduced, nor was Ethiopia made tributary to Persia until several years after the death of Cyrus, whose son, Cambyses, effected the conquests about B.C. 527-6. Human foresight could not, in the lifetime of Cyrus, have predicted with any certainty what would be the result of collision between Egypt and Persia; much less could it have ventured on the improbable supposition that the remote Ethiopia would submit itself to the Achae-menisn yoke. Yet this was the result of the invasion of Cambyses, who made Egypt a Persian province, and forced the Ethiopians to submit to the payment of an annual tribute (see Herod., 3:97; 7:69). And Seba. If \"Seba\" is \"the land of Meroe, which is enclosed between the White and Blue Niles\" (Delitzsch), it may be questioned whether really this ever formed a portion of the Persian empire. But Isaiah has probably no very distinct knowledge of the geographical position of Seba, or of the relations between the Sabaeans and the rest of the Ethiopians. He couples the two together, both here and in Isaiah 45:14, as forming two portions of one nation. The subjection of the Ethiopians involves, in his eyes, the subjection of the Sabaeans. And we cannot say that he is wrong, since it is not at all clear that the Sabaeans were not generally spread through Ethiopia, or at any rate scattered in various parts of the country.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah43:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTSince thou wast precious in my sight, thou hast been honourable, and I have loved thee: therefore will I give men for thee, and people for thy life.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 4. - Since thou wast precious. \"Since\" probably means \"from the time that\" (LXX., ἀφ οῦ), not \"because,\" as Delitzsch and Mr. Cheyne render. Israel became \"precious\" from the time that the promise was given to Jacob that in his seed all the nations of the earth should be blessed (Genesis 28:14). Thenceforward God placed the interests of Israel above those of \"men\" generally, and markedly above those of any other \"people.\" People; rather, peoples - as Mizraim, Cush, Seba (ver. 3).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah43:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFear not: for I am with thee: I will bring thy seed from the east, and gather thee from the west;VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 5. - Fear not: for I am with thee (comp. Isaiah 41:10). I will bring thy seed from the east... from the west. The actual extent of the Jewish diaspora in Isaiah's day has been greatly exaggerated by some modern critics, who say that there were at that date \"bands of Jewish exiles in the far lands of the Mediterranean, and even in China\" (Cheyne). Israel had been carried captive into Mesopotamia and into Media (2 Kings 17:6; 1 Chronicles 5:26), perhaps, also, into other regions belonging at the time to Assyria, as Babylonia, Assyria Proper, Syria. Two hundred thousand Jews had been taken to Nineveh by Sennacherib ('Eponym Canon,' p. 134), and planted probably by him m outlying portions of his dominions. But such transplantation would not carry the dispersion further than Cilicia and Cyprus towards the west, Armenia towards the north, Media towards the east, and the shores of the Persian Gulf towards the south. Any scattering of the nation into regions more remote than these, as into [Egypt, Ethiopia, Elam (Isaiah 11:11), and China - if Sinim is China (Isaiah 49:12) - must have been seen by Isaiah in vision, or made known to him by revelation. It had not taken place in his day. The expression, \"ends of the earth\" (ver. 6), must not be pressed in Isaiah any more than in Herodotus, where the ἐσχατίαι τῆς οἰκουμέης are India, Arabia, Ethiopia, and Scythia (3:106-116).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah43:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTI will say to the north, Give up; and to the south, Keep not back: bring my sons from far, and my daughters from the ends of the earth;VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 6. - Bring my sons. The nations are called upon, not merely to \"let Israel go,\" but to conduct and escort them from the places of their abode to their own country. (On the need of such escort, see Ezra 8:22, 31. On the actual furnishing of an escort in one case by a Persian king, see Nehemiah 2:7, 8.)NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah43:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTEven every one that is called by my name: for I have created him for my glory, I have formed him; yea, I have made him.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 7. - Every one that is called by my name. The very name of \"Israel\" meant \"prince of God,\" or \"soldier of God,\" and thus every Israelite was \"called by God's name.\" Israelites were also known among the nations as Jehovah-worshippers (see the Moabite Stone, line 18). I have created... formed... made him (comp. ver. 1). \"The three verbs describe the process of formation from the first rough cutting to the perfecting of the work\" (Cheyne). The third verb would, perhaps, be best translated. \"I have perfected,\" or \"I have completed (him).\" All three acts - creation, formation, and completion - are done by God for his own glory (comp. Proverbs 16:4).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah43:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBring forth the blind people that have eyes, and the deaf that have ears.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 8-13. - A RENEWED CHALLENGE TO THE NATIONS. The nations are once more challenged (comp. Isaiah 41:1, 21-26) to set forth the claims of their gods against those of Jehovah. Israel is summoned on the one hand (ver. 8); the nations on the other (ver. 9). What prophecy can the nations produce, either old or new? The Israelites can abundantly witness on behalf of Jehovah (ver. 10). Jehovah adds a further witness of himself (vers. 11-13). Verse 8. - Bring forth the blind people that have eyes. A tribunal is supposed to have been prepared, before which the contending parties are summoned to appear and plead. Israel is first summoned, as \"a blind people that have eyes;\" i.e. a people long blind (Isaiah 29:18; Isaiah 35:5; Isaiah 42:7, 18, 19), who have now, to some extent, recovered their sight (Isaiah 32:3; Isaiah 35:5), and are ready to witness for God. Next, the nations are summoned (see the following verse).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah43:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTLet all the nations be gathered together, and let the people be assembled: who among them can declare this, and shew us former things? let them bring forth their witnesses, that they may be justified: or let them hear, and say, It is truth.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 9. - All the nations; rather, all ye nations. Israel is a witness on the one hand, a multitude of nations on the other, recalling the contention of Elijah with the four hundred priests of Baal (1 Kings 18:22). The people; rather, the peoples. Who among them can declare this? i.e. which of them can show any prediction made by their gods comparable to the one contained in vers. 1-77 And show us former things. \"Exhibit the past history of the world in well-attested documents\" (Kay); \"Make mention of past events which they have correctly foretold\" (Cheyne, Delitzsch). According to the former rendering, the contrast is between the solemn, serious history of early times in Genesis, and the grotesque and extravagant myths, in which the nations generally embodied their views of the primitive ages. (For a specimen of the contrast, see 'Aids to Faith,' Essay 6. pp. 275, 276.) Let them bring forth their witnesses. Witnesses that the prophecies were really delivered before the events happened, or that the accounts of past times are such as have really come down to them from their ancestors. Or let them hear and say, It is truth. It is uncertain whether we ought to translate the initial vau here by \"and\" or by \"or.\" If the former, the sense is, \"And then let them (i.e. the witnesses) give ear to the assertions made, and declare them true;\" if the latter, we may render, with Dr. Kay, \"Or, if they have no witnesses, let them listen to the sacred records, and confess them to be the truth.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah43:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTYe are my witnesses, saith the LORD, and my servant whom I have chosen: that ye may know and believe me, and understand that I am he: before me there was no God formed, neither shall there be after me.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 10. - Ye are my witnesses, saith the Lord; i.e. \"Ye, Israel, are the witnesses that I cite\" - ye can prove the antiquity of the historical books of Scripture by the ordinary modes by which antiquity is proved, and also the exact dates of the prophetical sues. Ye can show what clear and unambiguous prophecies have been delivered centuries before the event, as the destruction of Jerusalem by a nation in whom none can fail to recognize the Romans (Deuteronomy 28:49-57), prophesied by Moses; the demolition of the altar at Bethel by a king of the house of David, Josiah by name, prophesied by a man of God in the reign of Jeroboam (1 Kings 13:2); the long continuance of David's progeny upon the throne of Judah, prophesied by Nathan in David's time (2 Samuel 7:11-16); the fairly long continuance of the house of Jehu on the throne of Israel, prophesied to Jehu himself (2 Kings 10:30); and the like. Israel has been at all times, and still is, one of the most important witnesses for God that exists in the world. Like the Church, Israel is the \"witness and keeper\" of a large portion of \"Holy Writ.\" Her past history witnesses for God. Her continued existence and present condition constitute additional testimony. And my Servant whom I have chosen. To explain this as meaning \"and ye are also my servant, whom I have chosen\" (Nagelsbach, Cheyne, Delitzsch), is to empty it of all its force. Manifestly, a further witness is adduced, \"Ye are my witnesses; and so is my Servant,\" etc. The \"Servant\" intended can only be the one true Servant of Isaiah 42:1-7, since faithful Israel is already among the witnesses. The prophet rises above the consideration of the immediately present, or of the single trial-scene which he is setting before us, and has in mind the great controversy ever going on between those who are for God and those who are against him. He sees, on the side of GodNEWLINENEWLINE(1) faithful Israel: andNEWLINENEWLINE(2) Christ, the \"Faithful Witness\" (Revelation 1:5; Revelation 3:14), who \"came into the world that he should bear witness of the truth\" (John 18:37). These are the two witnesses by whom God's truth is maintained in a world of falsehood and delusion. That ye may know. The subject is changed. \"Ye\" here points to \"the nations,\" or mankind at large. I am he (comp. Isaiah 41:4). Before me there was no God formed. All other gods beside me are \"formed\" gods - invented, fashioned, made by men. None of them was ever made before me. Ver 11. - Beside me there is no saviour. None but God can save men. Man cannot make atonement for his fellows; \"for it cost more to redeem their souls, so that he must let that alone for ever\" (Psalm 49:8, Prayer-book Version). The human \"saviours\" whom God raises up to deliver his people out of the hand of their enemies (Judges 3:9; 2 Kings 13:5; Nehemiah 9:27, etc.), are \"saviours\" in quite a secondary and inferior sense.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah43:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTI, even I, am the LORD; and beside me there is no saviour.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah43:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTI have declared, and have saved, and I have shewed, when there was no strange god among you: therefore ye are my witnesses, saith the LORD, that I am God.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 12. - I have declared, etc. Translate, I announced, and delivered, add proclaimed (the deliverance), when there was no strange god among you; 1.e I did what the idol-gods cannot do - announced deliverance, and effected it, and further proclaimed (or published) it, at the time when you Israelites had no idolatry among you. The allusion is to the deliverance of Jerusalem from Sennacherib, which God announced by the mouth of Isaiah (Isaiah 37:33-35), effected by the hand of his angel (Isaiah 37:36), and then caused to be published by Isaiah, who wrote the two accounts of the deliverance - both that in his own prophecy, and that in the Second Book of Kings (2 Kings 19:20-35). At that time there was no (open) idolatry in Judah, since Hezekiah had destroyed the idols (2 Kings 18:4). Therefore ye are my witnesses... that I am God; literally, and ye are my witnesses, and I am God. Ye can bear witness of the truth of what I have asserted in the previous portion of the verse, and your witness to this effect proves me to be God.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah43:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTYea, before the day was I am he; and there is none that can deliver out of my hand: I will work, and who shall let it?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 13. - Yea, before the day was I am he. So the LXX., Jerome, and Stier; but most moderns translate, \"Yea, from this time forth I am he\" (setup. Ezekiel 48:35). Kay, however, thinks that the translation of the Authorized Version may stand. Who shall let it? literally, as in Isaiah 14:27, who shall turn it back? i.e. \"reverse it, undo it.\" Surely no one.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah43:14VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThus saith the LORD, your redeemer, the Holy One of Israel; For your sake I have sent to Babylon, and have brought down all their nobles, and the Chaldeans, whose cry is in the ships.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 14-21. - A DECLARATION AGAINST BABYLON, AND A PROMISE OF ISRAEL'S RESTORATION. Having wound up the preceding \"controversy\" with a reference to his own power to work great results (ver. 13), Jehovah now brings forward two examples - the discomfiture of Babylon (vers. 14, 15), and the recovery and restoration of Israel (vers. 16-21), both of which he is about to accomplish. Verse 14. - For your sake I have sent to Babylon. For Israel's sake God has already, in his counsels, sent to Babylon the instruments of his vengeance - Cyrus and his soldiers - and by their instrumentality has brought down all their nobles; or rather, has brought them all down (to be fugitives (comp. Isaiah 15:5); and the Chaldeans; or, even the Chaldeans. The Chaldeans are not in Isaiah, as in Daniel (Daniel 2:2; Daniel 4:7; Daniel 5:7), a special class of Babylonians, but, as elsewhere commonly in Scripture, the Babylonians generally (see Isaiah 12:19; 47:1). In the native inscriptions the term is especially applied to the inhabitants of the tract upon the sea-coast. Whose cry is in the ships; rather, into their ships of wailing. The Chaldeans, flying from the Persian attack, betake themselves to their ships with cries of grief, the ships thereby becoming \"ships of wailing.\" The nautical character of the Babylonians is strongly marked in the inscriptions, where \"the ships of Ur are celebrated at a very remote period, and the native kings, when hard pressed by the Assyrians, are constantly represented as going on ship-board, and crossing the Persian Gulf to Susiana, or to some of the islands (see 'Records of the Past,' vol. 1. pp. 40, 43, 73; vol. 7. p. 63; vol. 9. p. 60). The abundant traffic and the numerous merchants of Babylon are mentioned by Ezekiel (Ezekiel 17:4). AEsehylus, moreover, notes that the Babylonians of his day were \"navigators of ships\" ('Persae,' 11. 52-55).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah43:15VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTI am the LORD, your Holy One, the creator of Israel, your King.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 15. - The Creator of Israel.

The deliverance out of Egypt is glanced at, to prepare the way for the announcement of deliverance from the hand of Babylon. Then \"a way was made in the sea\" (Exodus 14:21-29), \"and a path in the mighty waters;\" now it will be necessary to make \"a way in the wilderness\" (ver. 19).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah43:17VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWhich bringeth forth the chariot and horse, the army and the power; they shall lie down together, they shall not rise: they are extinct, they are quenched as tow.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 17. - Which bringeth forth the chariot and horse. Still the reference is to the events of the Exodus, whereof Israel is reminded, since \"the redemption out of Egypt was a type and pledge of the deliverance to be looked for out of Babylon\" (Delitzsch). God then \"brought out\" after Israel, to attack him, \"chariot and horse, army and power;\" but the result was their destruction. They shall lie down... they shall not rise; rather, they lie down... they do not rise (so Cheyne and Delitzsch). The future has here, as so often, the force of a present, the present being the praesens historicum. What the prophet describes in a few touches is the complete overthrow of Pharaoh's host in the Red Sea, and the entire extinction of that life which had just before shown itself as \"lusty and strong.\" Quenched as tow (comp. Isaiah 42:3). The metaphor is not drawn from burning tow, which is not very readily extinguished, but from the wick of a lamp, which a single breath puts out.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah43:18VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTRemember ye not the former things, neither consider the things of old.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 18. - Remember ye not the former things. The old deliverance will be as nothing compared with the new. Israel must cast its eye forwards, not backwards. Mr. Cheyne well compares Jeremiah 23:7, 8, and also well notes that \"the chief glories of the second manifestation are spiritual.\" Israel in the wilderness was a stiff:necked and rebellious people, given to murmuring, licentiousness, and idolatry. Israel, returned from Babylon, will no more hanker after idols, but will have God's Law \"put in their inward parts\" (Jeremiah 32:33), and will \"show forth God's praise\" (ver. 21).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah43:19VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBehold, I will do a new thing; now it shall spring forth; shall ye not know it? I will even make a way in the wilderness, and rivers in the desert.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 19. - Behold, I will do a new thing (comp. Isaiah 42:9, with the comment). It is, of course, quite possible that the novelty is not merely in the circumstances of the deliverance, but extends to all its results, among which is the Messianic kingdom - verily, a \"new thing\" (see Jeremiah 31:22). Now it shall spring forth; rather, already it is springing up (comp. Isaiah 42:9). Things, however, are more advanced (to the prophet's eye) than when that passage was written. Events are shaping themselves - the deliverance approaches. Shall ye not know it? rather, will ye not give heed to it? Will not the exiled people, whom Isaiah addresses, turn their thoughts this way, and let the idea of deliverance take possession of their minds, instead of brooding on past and present sufferings (see Isaiah 40:30; Isaiah 41:17; Isaiah 42:22)? God is about to make a way in the wilderness, and rivers in the desert. As he led his people out of their Egyptian bondage, first through the Red Sea, and then through a \"howling wilderness\" (Deuteronomy 32:10), so now he will \"make a way\" for them through a still more desolate tract. We are nowhere historically told by what route the Israelites ultimately returned. If they went by Tadmor and Damascus, they must have traversed a most arid and difficult desert. Even if they did not quit the Euphrates till they reached the latitude of Aleppo, still they must have had some wide tracts of wilderness to cross.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah43:20VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe beast of the field shall honour me, the dragons and the owls: because I give waters in the wilderness, and rivers in the desert, to give drink to my people, my chosen.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 20. - The beast of the field shall honour me. The animal creation shall, participate in the benefits of the \"new thing\" introduced by the restoration of Israel, and in their dumb way shall show their gratitude. The dragons and the owls. The recent mention of the desert causes animals of the desert (Isaiah 13:21, 22) to be taken as examples. (On the animals intended, see the comment on Isaiah 34:13.) If even the beasts of the desert honoured God, much more would the rest of the animal creation (comp. Isaiah 11:6-8).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah43:21VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThis people have I formed for myself; they shall shew forth my praise.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 21. - This people have I formed for myself (see above, ver. 7, and comp. Proverbs 16:4). They shall show forth my praise; i.e. their restoration to their own land shall cause them to glorify me both with songs of praise (for the fulfilment, see Ezra 3:9-11; Nehemiah 12:27; and the post-Captivity psalms), and also by a life in accordance with my laws.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah43:22VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut thou hast not called upon me, O Jacob; but thou hast been weary of me, O Israel.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 22-28. - A REPROACH ADDRESSED TO CAPTIVE ISRAEL FOR ITS PAST OMISSIONS AND SINS. The thought of Israel in the future, redeemed, restored, and \"telling out God's praise\" (ver. 21), raises naturally the con-trusted thought of Israel in the present and the past, disobedient, full of shortcomings (vers. 22-24), too often guilty of overt acts of sin (vers. 24-28). While reproaching his people, and reminding them that the exile is the wellmented punishment of their past offences (vers. 27, 28), God still promises them pardon if they will appeal to his covenant of mercy (vers. 25, 26). Verse 22. - But thou hast not called upon me. The Jews had never been greatly given to prayer. They were a \"practical\" people, active, energetic, hard-working, busily employed in handicrafts, commerce, or agriculture. David and Daniel, who prayed three times a day (Psalm 55:17; Daniel 6:10), were probably exceptions to the general rule. At any rate, it appears here that in the exile the nation had neglected prayer. No doubt there was a nucleus of \"faithful men,\" who did as Daniel did. But with the mass it was otherwise. Hard toil occupied their time. Despair made dull their hearts. They looked for no alleviation of their lot, and lived on in a sort of apathy. But thou hast been weary of me; rather, for thou hast wearied of me. Thou hast left off praying, because thou wast weary of my service.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah43:23VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThou hast not brought me the small cattle of thy burnt offerings; neither hast thou honoured me with thy sacrifices. I have not caused thee to serve with an offering, nor wearied thee with incense.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 23. - Thou hast not brought me the small cattle of thy burnt offerings. If this reproach is regarded as addressed to captive Israel, who could not offer sacrifices, we must explain it by the analogy of the expression, \"the calves of your lips\" (Hosea 14:2). All prayer may be regarded as a sort of offering, and withholding it as withholding sacrifice. But it is possible that the prophet is not addressing captive Israel only, but carrying his thoughts back to the period preceding the Captivity, when there was a general neglect of God's service, and for a time the temple was given up to idol-worship (2 Kings 21:3-7; 2 Kings 23:4-14). The glance back at earlier times is apparent in vers. 27, 28. I have not caused thee to serve with an offering, etc.; rather, I put no heavy service on thee in respect of meat offering, neither made I thee to toil in respect of incense; i.e. \"my positive requirements have been light - surely thou shouldst have complied with them.\" Meat offerings were to accompany every sacrifice, but were a small burthen. Incense was not required from any private person.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah43:24VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThou hast bought me no sweet cane with money, neither hast thou filled me with the fat of thy sacrifices: but thou hast made me to serve with thy sins, thou hast wearied me with thine iniquities.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 24. - Thou hast bought me no sweet cane with money. \"Sweet cane\" is mentioned in the Law only in connection with the \"holy anointing oil\" (Exodus 30:23). But the present passage raises a suspicion that it was practically used in the burnt offerings of private persons (see the next clause). That it was anciently used in Babylonia in sacrifice, appears from the Deluge Tablets ('Transactions of Society of Bibl. Archaeol.,' vol. 3. p. 559, 1. 48). But thou hast made me to serve with thy sins. \"The sins of Israel,\" as Delitzsch observes, \"pressed upon Jehovah, as a burthen does upon a servant.\" This is a part of the fundamental idea running through the third part of Isaiah, closely connected with the mediatorial office of the \"Servant of the Lord,\" who \"bare the sin of many\" (Isaiah 53:12), and on whom \"the Lord laid the iniquity of us all\" (Isaiah 53:6). Israel, both during the Captivity and before, had accumulated a heavy load of sin, not merely by negligence, but by overt acts of guilt (see Isaiah 1:4, 15, 21-23, etc.).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah43:25VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTI, even I, am he that blotteth out thy transgressions for mine own sake, and will not remember thy sins.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 25. - I, even I, am he that blotteth out thy transgressions (comp. Psalm 51:1, 9). The idea is based on that of sins being \"noted in a book\" (Psalm 56:8; Revelation 20:12). For mine own sake; i.e. purely from the love that I bare thee.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah43:26VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTPut me in remembrance: let us plead together: declare thou, that thou mayest be justified.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 26. - Put me in remembrance. Either, ironically, \"Remind me of thy good deeds; plead thy cause with me on that ground; show the merits that justify thee;\" or else seriously, \"Remind me of my promises; plead them before me; declare them, that by my free grace I may justify thee.\" The latter is the more probable interpretation.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah43:27VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThy first father hath sinned, and thy teachers have transgressed against me.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 27. - Thy first father hath sinned; rather, thy first father sinned; that is, \"Thou hast no merits of thy own. Even thy first father, Abraham, sinned (Genesis 12:13, 18; Genesis 17:17; Genesis 20:2); and thy teachers have transgressed. Thy very priests and prophets have been full of imperfections - have often sinned against me. Much more hast thou, my people generally, committed grievous offences. Thou must therefore throw thyself on my mercy.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah43:28VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTTherefore I have profaned the princes of the sanctuary, and have given Jacob to the curse, and Israel to reproaches.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 28. - Therefore I have profaned the princes of the sanctuary. The \"princes of the sanctuary\" (literally, \"princes of holiness\") are the principal members of the priesthood, who were carried into captivity with the rest of the people (2 Kings 25:18), and deprived of their functions, as a part of the punishment due to Israel for its sins. Israel itself was at the same time given to the curse of a severe bondage and to the reproaches of the neighboring nation.NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINE","Isa.44":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah44:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTYet now hear, O Jacob my servant; and Israel, whom I have chosen:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 1-5. - A PROPHECY OF ISRAEL'S SPIRITUAL RECOVERY AND REGENERATION. This section is closely connected with ch. 43, of which it ought to form the conclusion. The prophet cannot bear to leave Israel under a ban - its spiritual guides \"profaned,\" and itself given over to \"reproaches.\" He must end with a brighter prospect. Accordingly, he holds out, in the present passage, the double hopeNEWLINENEWLINE(1) of the blessing of an abundant outpouring of the Spirit, to take the place of the preceding \"curse\" (Isaiah 43:28); andNEWLINENEWLINE(2) of a pressing of proselytes into the renovated Church, who will hold it in honour, instead of making it the object of their \"reproaches.\" Verse 1. - Yet now hear; i.e. \"be not dismayed at what has been said. Listen a little longer.\" O Jacob my servant, etc. A recurrence to the terms of endearment used in Isaiah 41:8, showing that words of favour and' promise are about to follow.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah44:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThus saith the LORD that made thee, and formed thee from the womb, which will help thee; Fear not, O Jacob, my servant; and thou, Jesurun, whom I have chosen.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 2. - The Lord that made thee, and formed thee from the womb (see Isaiah 43:1, 7). \"From the womb\" is added here for increased emphasis. Jesurun. The Lord's people have their proper names - Jacob, Israel, Jesurun, or rather, Jeshurun. \"Jacob\" marks them simply as descendants of the patriarch - the people to whom the promises were made. \"Israel\" marks their militant character - that as \"God's soldiers\" they fought his battles and maintained his cause in the midst of a hostile world. The third name, \"Jeshurun,\" which is very rarely used (only here and in Deuteronomy 32:15; Deuteronomy 33:5, 26), designates them as \"righteous,\" being a derivative from the root yashar (or joshar), equivalent to \"upright,\" and points to that standard of moral excellence which it was their duty to set forth, and which to some extent they did set forth, in a world that \"lay in wickedness.\" Had they been more worthy of the name, it would probably have been oftener applied to them.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah44:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor I will pour water upon him that is thirsty, and floods upon the dry ground: I will pour my spirit upon thy seed, and my blessing upon thine offspring:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 3. - I will pour water upon him that is thirsty. \"Water\" is, in Isaiah, the common metaphor for Divine grace. Sometimes, as in this place (and Isaiah 35:6; Isaiah 43:20; Isaiah 55:1), the simple maim, \"water\" or \"waters,\" is the word used. At other times we have instead, or in addition, \"rain\" (Isaiah 5:6; Isaiah 30:23; Isaiah 55:10), or \"dew\" (Isaiah 26:19), or \"rivers\" (Isaiah 30:25; Isaiah 32:2; Isaiah 33:21; Isaiah 41:18; Isaiah 43:19, etc.), or \"streams\" (Isaiah 30:25; Isaiah 35:6), or \"floods\" (as in this place). At his coming on earth, our blessed Lord took up the comparison, and has made it familiar to all men throughout the whole Christian world (see John 3:5; John 4:10, 11, 13-15; John 7:37-39). We may note here that the \"water\" is only poured on him who is athirst for it. Thy seed... thine offspring. Not \"Israel after the flesh\" only, but also Israel after the Spirit - the true \"Israel of God\" (Galatians 6:16).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah44:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd they shall spring up as among the grass, as willows by the water courses.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 4. - They shall spring up as among the grass. The LXX. have, \"As grass among the waters;\" and this reading is followed by Bishop Lowth, Ewald, and Mr. Cheyne. But there does not seem to be any necessity for departing from the existing Hebrew text. As willows. There is some doubt whether the Hebrew word used ('ereb) is rightly translated \"willows.\" The modern yarab seems certainly not to be a \"willow,\" but rather a species of Viburnum (see the long note in Delitzsch's 'Commentary on Isaiah,' vol. 2. pp. 203, 204, Eng. trans.). It is, however, most strictly a water-plant, growing only \"near flowing water.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah44:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTOne shall say, I am the LORD'S; and another shall call himself by the name of Jacob; and another shall subscribe with his hand unto the LORD, and surname himself by the name of Israel.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 5. - One shall say, I am the Lord's, etc. There shall be an influx of proselytes. Instead of the heathen nations looking scornfully on, and uttering gibes and jeers (Psalm 137:7) at Israel's fall, on seeing Israel's rise they shall be anxious to have a part in it, and shall hasten to enrol themselves among the worshippers of Jehovah. \"One shall say, I am Jehovah's,\" - while \"another shall proclaim the name of Jacob,\" as that in which he glories; and a third \"shall write on his hand, (I am) Jehovah's, and take as a surname the name of Israel.\" It was usual among the heathen nations to mark the name of a god upon the bodies of persons specially devoted to him (Herod., 2:113; 7:235); and, though the practice was forbidden to Israelites (Leviticus 19:28), it might naturally continue in use among semi-heathen proselytes.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah44:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThus saith the LORD the King of Israel, and his redeemer the LORD of hosts; I am the first, and I am the last; and beside me there is no God.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 6-20. - A FURTHER CONTRAST OF GOD WITH IDOLS. The captive Jews, dwelling scattered in a land the inhabitants of which were, one and all, idolaters, and having by hereditary taint an inclination to idolatry, would be easily tempted, during the long and weary period of the Captivity, to put away the worship and even the thought of Jehovah, who had allowed their subjugation, and conform to the religion of their conquerors. Hence the repeated contrasts in these later chapters - specially addressed to caprice Israel - between Jehovah and idols, and the sharp ridicule of the latter (comp. Isaiah 40:18-25; Isaiah 41:4-7, 21-29). Verse 6. - The Lord the King of Israel. Therefore entitled to Israel's allegiance (comp. Isaiah 43:15). And his Redeemer; i.e. Israel's Redeemer - he who had redeemed them from Egyptian bondage - who will redeem them from the power of Babylon - who, best of all, will redeem them from their sins. The First... the Last (comp. Isaiah 41:4, with the comment). Beside me there is no God. This had been distinctly asserted in the Law (Deuteronomy 4:35, 39; Deuteronomy 32:39); but Israel could not be induced practically to believe it. The \"gods of the nations\" were supposed generally to be realities, actual powers, not perhaps so potent as Jehovah, but still real beings, capable of doing good and harm (see Isaiah 41:23). It is one of Isaiah's special objects in these later chapters to disabuse Israel of this notion (see Isaiah 41:21-24; Isaiah 43:9-11; Isaiah 45:5, 6, 14-22, etc.).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah44:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd who, as I, shall call, and shall declare it, and set it in order for me, since I appointed the ancient people? and the things that are coming, and shall come, let them shew unto them.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 7. - Who, as I, shall call, etc.? i.e. \"Who will do (or who can do) as I do - call events into being, declare them, and set them in order beforehand - who can do this for me (or, in my stead)? No one. I have done it, ever since I appointed (or, placed upon earth) the ancient people\" that is, the race of men before the Flood (see Job 22:15). The claim is that, from the first creation of mankind, God has not only prearranged the events that should happen, but has declared them by the mouth of prophets (see Genesis 3:15; Genesis 6:13, 17; Genesis 8:22, 23; 9:12-16, etc.). No other has done the same. The things that are coming, and shall come. Not earlier and later events, but \"future events,\" and \"such as will actually come to pass\" (Kay, Cheyne). Let the idol-gods declare these, if they are to be entitled to consideration.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah44:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFear ye not, neither be afraid: have not I told thee from that time, and have declared it? ye are even my witnesses. Is there a God beside me? yea, there is no God; I know not any.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 8. - Fear ye not (comp. Isaiah 41:10, 13; Isaiah 43:5; ver. 2). Israel need not fear that they will be forgotten or forsaken. God has told them from that time, or, from the beginning (Isaiah 48:3, 7), and declared to them, what he is about to do - viz, destroy Babylon, and give them deliverance. He will assuredly do as he has said. Ye are even my witnesses (comp. Isaiah 43:10, 12). There is no God; literally, there is no Rock; i.e. no sure ground of trust or confidence (comp. Isaiah 17:10; Isaiah 26:4; Isaiah 30:29; and see the comment on Isaiah 17:10).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah44:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThey that make a graven image are all of them vanity; and their delectable things shall not profit; and they are their own witnesses; they see not, nor know; that they may be ashamed.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 9-20. - The uniqueness of God having been set forth, the prophet now turns to the images and the image-makers, overwhelming them with his scorn and ridicule. The passage may be compared with Jeremiah 10:3-10 and Baruch 6:8-72. Verse 9. - They that make a graven image are... vanity; rather, are confusion. The word used is tohu, which, together with bohu, describes the primitive chaos in Genesis 1:2 (comp. Isaiah 24:10; Isaiah 34:11; Isaiah 40:17, 23; Isaiah 41:29; Isaiah 59:4). Their delectable things shall not profit. \"Their delectable things\" are their idols, which are \"pets, favourites, treasures.\" These cannot possibly be of any advantage to them. They are their own witnesses. Their powerlessness stands confessed in their very appearance, since they are manifestly sightless and senseless. That they may be ashamed. The subject of this clause cannot be sought in the earlier part of the verse. It is the idol-makers that will be put to shame.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah44:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWho hath formed a god, or molten a graven image that is profitable for nothing?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 10. - Who hath... molten a graven image? Metal idols were mostly cast in the first instance, and then finished off with a graving-tool. \"Who hath molten\" means \"who has been so foolish as to do so - to take so much trouble about a thing which cannot possibly profit any one?\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah44:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBehold, all his fellows shall be ashamed: and the workmen, they are of men: let them all be gathered together, let them stand up; yet they shall fear, and they shall be ashamed together.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 11. - All his fellows; or, all its associates; i.e. all who are associated together in the worship of the idol. The worshippers of a particular idol, or sometimes of a particular god, formed a sort of guild or company, bound together by common participation in certain rites, and under an obligation to defend each other. The prophet says that, though the worshippers and the makers should, all of them, be gathered together, and stand up to help one the ether, yet should they be unable to effect anything. Gathered together against God, they would \"tremble and be ashamed.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah44:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe smith with the tongs both worketh in the coals, and fashioneth it with hammers, and worketh it with the strength of his arms: yea, he is hungry, and his strength faileth: he drinketh no water, and is faint.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 12. - The smith with the tongs. The Hebrew text is defective, some word having fallen out. We should probably supply \"maketh,\" and translate, The smith maketh an axe, and worketh it in the coals, and with hammers fashioneth it. The description of image-making thus commences with the fashioning of the carpenter's tools. He is hungry, etc. The artificer who takes the first step in \"forming a god\" (ver. 10) is himself hungry and thirsty, depending on so mean a thing as food to supply him with the needful strength. Unless he can cat and drink, the whole work is brought to a standstill.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah44:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe carpenter stretcheth out his rule; he marketh it out with a line; he fitteth it with planes, and he marketh it out with the compass, and maketh it after the figure of a man, according to the beauty of a man; that it may remain in the house.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 13. - The carpenter, etc. When the smith has done his part in the formation of tools, the carpenter is called into action. His proceedings are traced \"extragressively.\" (Delitzsch). First, he is regarded as in possession of his block of wood. On this he proceeds to stretch out his rule, to obtain the idol's length and breadth. Then he marks out on the block a rough outline with red chalk (sered). After this he pares away the superfluous wood with planes, or chisels, and marks out the limbs more accurately with the compass, planing and measuring until he has brought the rough block into the figure of a man, and impressed on it something of the beauty of a man, so that it may seem worthy of remaining in the place where it is set up, whether temple or private house. But there is something necessarily anterior to all this. To obtain his block, the carpenter must first cut down a tree, or have one cut down for him (ver. 14); to obtain a tree, he (or some one for him) must have planted it; for the tree to have grown to a fitting size, the rain must have watered it. So the very existence of these wooden idols depends ultimately on whether it has rained or not - i.e., whether God has given his rain or withheld it.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah44:14VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHe heweth him down cedars, and taketh the cypress and the oak, which he strengtheneth for himself among the trees of the forest: he planteth an ash, and the rain doth nourish it.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 14. - Cedars... cypress... oak. The second of the trees mentioned is more probably the ilex than the cypress, which does not grow either in Palestine or in Babylonia. Idols would be made of cedar on account of its fragrance, of flex and oak on account of their hardness and durability. Cedar was used as a material for carved figures in Egypt (Birch, 'Contents of British Museum,' p. 21). Which he strengtheneth for himself among the trees of the forest. The meaning is obscure. Dr. Kay translates, \"and he encourages himself in the trees of the forest,\" which conveys no very distinct idea; Delitzsch, \"and he chooses for himself among the trees,\" etc., which is sufficiently clear, but scarcely obtainable from the Hebrew text; Knobel, \"he makes himself secure among the trees\" (by putting a mark on those which he intends to have), which imparts an idea certainly not contained in the original. He planteth an ash. It is uncertain, and it does not greatly matter, what tree is intended. The point is that, before trees can grow up, they have to be planted, and that, for them to grow when planted, God's gift of rain is necessary (see the comment on ver. 13).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah44:15VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen shall it be for a man to burn: for he will take thereof, and warm himself; yea, he kindleth it, and baketh bread; yea, he maketh a god, and worshippeth it; he maketh it a graven image, and falleth down thereto.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 15. - Then shall it be for a man to burn. The tree that has been planted, and nourished, and has grown up is naturally \"for a man to burn.\" That is its ordinary destination; and even the idolater applies it partly to this purpose; but out of a portion he maketh a god. The very same tree serves him both for fuel and for a divinity.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah44:16VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHe burneth part thereof in the fire; with part thereof he eateth flesh; he roasteth roast, and is satisfied: yea, he warmeth himself, and saith, Aha, I am warm, I have seen the fire:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 16. - He burneth part thereof; rather, half thereof; \"With half thereof\" - not the other half, but the same - \"he eateth flesh.\" One fire serves for the two purposes of warming him and cooking his victuals.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah44:17VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the residue thereof he maketh a god, even his graven image: he falleth down unto it, and worshippeth it, and prayeth unto it, and saith, Deliver me; for thou art my god.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 17. - The residue thereof; i.e. the other half.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah44:18VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThey have not known nor understood: for he hath shut their eyes, that they cannot see; and their hearts, that they cannot understand.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 18. - They have not known nor understood. The cause of all this folly is a Minding of the understanding, divinely caused in the way of punishment, on account of their having wilfully closed their eyes to the truth. Because they \"did not like to retain God in their knowledge, God gave them up to a reprobate (or, undistinguishing) mind\" (Romans 1:28; comp. Isaiah 29:10). He hath shut; or, One hath shut.

It is implied that the idolaters had once had it in their power to think and reason justly upon the absurdity of such conduct as that which was now habitual to them. But they had lost the power. They had suffered themselves little by little to be deluded. The stock of a tree. The marginal rendering, \"that which comes of a tree,\" is preferable.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah44:20VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHe feedeth on ashes: a deceived heart hath turned him aside, that he cannot deliver his soul, nor say, Is there not a lie in my right hand?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 20. - He feedeth on ashes; i.e. on vanity - on what can give no support or sustenance (comp. Proverbs 15:14; Hosea 12:1). A deceived heart. Either self-deceived, or imposed upon by illusions from without; e.g. the seeming power of the idols, as seen in the victories and conquests of their worshippers. He cannot deliver his soul. The deceived soul is bound in trammels, which it feels to be irksome, and from which it would fain be free. But it cannot deliver itself. Deliverance must come from some external source; in other words, man needs a Deliverer. Is there not a lie in my right hand? An idol is \"a lie.\" It professes to have power, strength, ability to help and save, whereas it has no power at all. It cannot even save itself. Savages often beat their fetishes. Diagoras of Melos threw an image of Hercules into the fire on which he was cooking his dinner, and bade Hercules make himself of some use by boiling his turnips. The powerlessness of idols even to help themselves is represented with much force in the Book of Baruch (6:12-15, 17-22, 27, 49, etc.).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah44:21VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTRemember these, O Jacob and Israel; for thou art my servant: I have formed thee; thou art my servant: O Israel, thou shalt not be forgotten of me.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 21-28. - ISRAEL ONCE MORE PROMISED DELIVERANCE, AND THE DELIVERER MENTIONED BY NAME. Israel, having been exhorted never to forget the impotency of idols (ver. 21), is promised forgiveness and deliverance (vers. 21, 22). Then, heaven and earth are called upon to join in rejoicing over the announcement (ver. 23). Finally, in a noble burst of poetry, God is represented as solemnly declaring his intention of frustrating all the false sayings of the soothsayers concerning his people, and accomplishing their restoration to their own land, and the rebuilding of their temple through the instrumentality of Cyrus (vers. 24-28). Verse 21. - Remember these; rather, remember these things; i.e. the futility of idols and the folly of the idol-worshippers. For thou art my servant. Therefore bound to worship me, and not the idols (comp. Isaiah 41:8; vers. 1, 2). I have formed thee (so also in Isaiah 43:1, 21; vers. 2, 24). The duty of absolute unquestioning obedience seems contained in the relation of that which is formed to that which has formed it. On the other hand, it may be assumed that he who has formed a thing will have a constant care of it and regard for it - that at any rate he will not \"forget\" it.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah44:22VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTI have blotted out, as a thick cloud, thy transgressions, and, as a cloud, thy sins: return unto me; for I have redeemed thee.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 22. - I have blotted out... thy sins (comp. Isaiah 43:25). The promise there made is here represented as having its fulfilment. Before God reverses his sentence and restores his people, he must first forgive them. As a thick cloud... as a cloud. It would be better to translate, as a cloud... as a thick cloud. The latter of the two Hebrew words used is the more emphatic. Return unto me. This is an underlying condition, both of restoration and of forgiveness. Only the penitent can be received back into favour. The knowledge, however, that God has, in his counsels, \"redeemed\" his people generally, may act as a stimulus on individuals to repent and turn to him.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah44:23VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTSing, O ye heavens; for the LORD hath done it: shout, ye lower parts of the earth: break forth into singing, ye mountains, O forest, and every tree therein: for the LORD hath redeemed Jacob, and glorified himself in Israel.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 23. - Sing, O ye heavens. The sympathy of external nature with the fortunes of Israel is assumed throughout Isaiah, as it is throughout the Psalms (see Psalm 11:6-8; 24:4-7; 29:17; 30:25, 26; 33:9; 35:1, 2, 7, etc.). If Israel is depressed, the earth must \"mourn and languish,\" the heavens grow dark; the mountains shrink and \"be ashamed.\" If, on the contrary, Israel prospers, heaven and earth, mountain and forest, Isaiah 49:13),of the joy felt by the angels over the returning and pardoned sinner; but the context of both passages is in favour of the material heavens being meant. It is quite possible that there is a real and not merely a fancied sympathy between the material and the spiritual worlds. The Lord hath done it; literally, the Lord hath wrought - what he has wrought is not said. Mr. Cheyne translates, \"Jehovah hath done nobly.\" Shout, ye lower parts of the earth. Metonymy of the part for the whole - \"the lower parts of the earth\" for \"the earth even to its lowest depths.\" There is no thought of Sheol or of its inhabitants. Break forth into singing (comp. Isaiah 14:7; Isaiah 35:2). As children and birds sing from the very gladness of their hearts, thereby venting the joy that almost oppresses them, so all nature is called upon, not merely to rejoice, but to give vent to its joy, now that Israel is redeemed and God glorified.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah44:24VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThus saith the LORD, thy redeemer, and he that formed thee from the womb, I am the LORD that maketh all things; that stretcheth forth the heavens alone; that spreadeth abroad the earth by myself;VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 24. - Thus saith the Lord. This is not a new prophecy entirely unconnected with the preceding, as Delitzsch supposes, lint a declaration to which the prophet has been working up, and which he intends as the crown and climax of all that he has been announcing with respect to Israel's deliverance. Not only is the deliverance absolutely determined on in God's counsels, but the Deliverer himself is already chosen and designated. He that formed thee from the womb (comp. ver. 2). I am the Lord that maketh all things - rather, I the Lord am he that doeth all things; i.e. I am he that executeth whatever he designs - that stretcheth forth the heavens alone (comp. Job 9:8), that spreadeth abroad the earth by myself. God did not delegate the creation of the heaven and the earth to an inferior spirit, a δημιουργός, as the Greeks generally taught. He did not even call in the co operation of a helper. Singly and solely by his own power he created all things.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah44:25VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThat frustrateth the tokens of the liars, and maketh diviners mad; that turneth wise men backward, and maketh their knowledge foolish;VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 25. - That frustrateth the tokens of the liars; i.e. \"who brings to nought the prognostications of the astrologers and soothsayers, that pretend falsely to a knowledge of future events\" (see Isaiah 49:13; and comp. Jeremiah 29:8, 9); and maketh diviners mad; i.e. \"shows them to be thole or madmen\" (see Job 12:17). That turneth wise men backward; i.e. \"repulses them - puts them to flight.\" Pretenders to wisdom, rather than truly wise men, are meant.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah44:26VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThat confirmeth the word of his servant, and performeth the counsel of his messengers; that saith to Jerusalem, Thou shalt be inhabited; and to the cities of Judah, Ye shall be built, and I will raise up the decayed places thereof:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 26. - That confirmeth the word of his servant; that is, of Isaiah himself, whom God calls \"my Servant\" in Isaiah 20:3. The \"messengers\" are the prophets generally. Before the return from the Captivity took place, it had been prophesied, not only by Isaiah, but by Jeremiah (Jeremiah 29:10-14), by Ezekiel (Ezekiel 39:25-28), by Joel 3:1), by Amos (Amos 9:11-15), by Obadiah (Obadiah:20), by Micah (Micah 4:10), and by Zephaniah (Zephaniah 3:14-20).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah44:27VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThat saith to the deep, Be dry, and I will dry up thy rivers:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 27. - That saith to the deep, Be dry (comp. Isaiah 42:15). \"The flood\" here is probably the main stream of the Euphrates, while \"the rivers\" are the various side streams which branched off from it and again united themselves with it. Some commentators regard the drying of Euphrates as a mere metaphor for the exhaustion and ruin of Babylon (Kay); but (with Delitzsch) I should be inclined to understand a reference to the action of Cyrus in drawing off the water of the river (see the comment on Isaiah 42:15).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah44:28VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThat saith of Cyrus, He is my shepherd, and shall perform all my pleasure: even saying to Jerusalem, Thou shalt be built; and to the temple, Thy foundation shall be laid.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 28. - That saith of Cyrus. The mention of Cyrus by name, here and again in Isaiah 45:1, has no doubt been one of the main grounds on which has been set up the theory of two Isaiahs. It has been thought incredible, or at any rate contrary to the analogy of prophetical revelation, that so minute a matter as the name of a man should have been announced in prophecy more than a century before his birth. There is, however, the parallel case of Josiah, who, according to the author of the Books of Kings, was announced by name more than three centuries before his birth (1 Kings 13:2). And there are the extremely minute facts noted in Daniel 11, which were prophetically de-dared from two centuries to three centuries and a half before they happened. It is, perhaps, assuming that we know more than we really do know about the object and laws of prophetic utterance, to lay it down that there can be no minute prophecy except when the prophet is living in the midst of the events. It is certainly a very marvellous thing that Isaiah, living at the close of the eighth and the beginning of the seventh century B.C., should -mention a king by name who did not ascend the throne till the middle of the sixth; but no one can suppose that God could not have made such a revelation to him if he pleased. An attempt to minimize the marvel, without postulating two Isaiahs, has been made by the supposition that \"Cyrus\" was not really a proper name, but an old title of the Persian (Achaemenian) kings, signifying\" the sun,\" and that Isaiah, therefore, only meant to point out Persia as the power which would destroy Babylon, which he had already done in effect in Isaiah 21:2. But, in reality, there is no sufficient ground for either of the two statementsNEWLINENEWLINE(1) that Cyrus meant \"the sun,\" andNEWLINENEWLINE(2) that it was an old titular name of all the Persian kings.NEWLINENEWLINEThat \"Cyrus\" meant \"the sun,\" rests upon the weak authorities of Plutarch and Ctesias, and has been disproved by Sir H. Rawlinson ('Cuneiform Inscriptions,' vol. 2, p. 112). That it was an old titular name of all the Persian kings is directly contrary to the evidence. Out of fourteen Achaemenian kings, two only bore the name; and they bore it as their one and only personal appellation. It was also borne by an Achaemenian prince who had no other name. It is as purely a proper name as Cambyses, or Xerxes, or Darius. The theory of Dean Plumptre ('Biblical Studies,' p. 195) must therefore be set aside as untenable, and we must face the fact that the great Cyrus, who reigned from B.C. 559 to B.C. 529, is mentioned in prophecies attributed to a writer whose death cannot be placed much later than B.C. 700. The name which the Greeks expressed by Κύρος and the Romans by \"Cyrus,\" is in the original Persian Kurush, in the old Babylonian Kuras, and in the Hebrew Koresh. He is my shepherd; i.e. not a mere ordinary king, who was often called \"the shepherd of his people (ποιμὴν λαῶν),\" but \"my shepherd\" - the shepherd of my people, who will tend them and care for them. And shall perform (literally, accomplish) all my pleasure. Cyrus is said by Josephus to have had ibis prophecy pointed out to him on his conquest of Babylon, and to have thereupon determined to fulfil what was written ('Ant. Jud.,' 12:1, § 2). His edict, reported by Ezra (Ezra 1:2-4), contained a statement that \"Jehovah had charged him to build him a house at Jerusalem.\" It is difficult to see any sufficient political object for his restoration of the Jews to their country. Thou shalt be built; rather, it shall be built. Thy foundation shall be laid; literally, it shall be founded. The decree of Cyrus found by Darius at Ecbatana required that \"the foundations of the house should be strongly laid\" (Ezra 6:3), and prescribed its dimensions and materials. (On the actual laying of the foundations, see Ezra 3:8-13.)NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINE","Isa.45":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah45:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThus saith the LORD to his anointed, to Cyrus, whose right hand I have holden, to subdue nations before him; and I will loose the loins of kings, to open before him the two leaved gates; and the gates shall not be shut;VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 1-7. - GOD'S WILL CONCERNING HIM ANNOUNCED TO CYRUS. This direct address of God to a heathen king is without a parallel in Scripture. Nebuchadnezzar, Pharaoh, Abimelech, were warned through dreams. Nebuchadnezzar was even promised Divine aid (Ezekiel 30:24, 25). But no heathen monarch had previously been personally addressed by God, much less called \"his anointed,\" and spoken to by his name (ver. 4). Three motives are mentioned for this special favour to him:NEWLINENEWLINE(1) that he might acknowledge Jehovah to be the true God;NEWLINENEWLINE(2) that Israel might be benefited and advantaged by him;NEWLINENEWLINE(3) that the attention of the whole world might be attracted, and the unity of God made manifest far and wide (vers. 3-6). Verse 1. - Thus saith the Lord to his anointed. The \"anointed of Jehovah\" is elsewhere always either an Israelite king, or the expected Deliverer of the nation, \"Messiah the Prince\" (Daniel 9:25). This Deliverer, however, was to be of the line of David (Isaiah 11:1), and of the city of Bethlehem (Micah 5:2), so that we can scarcely suppose Isaiah to have seen him in Cyrus. But he may have seen in Cyrus a type of the great Deliverer, as he saw in the release of Israel from the power of Babylon a type of their deliverance from sin. Whose right hand I have holden; rather, strengthened (comp. Ezekiel 30:24). To subdue nations before him (see above, Isaiah 41:2, and the comment ad loc.). Among the nations subdued by Cyrus may be mentioned the Medes, the Babylonians, the Lydians, the Caftans, the Caunians, the Lycians, the Bactrians, the Sacae, the Parthians, the Hyrcanians, the Chorasmians, the Sogdians, the Arians of Herat, the Zarangians, the Arachosians, the Satagydians, and the Gandarians. I will loose the loins of kings; i.e. render them weak and incapable of resistance\" (comp. Daniel 5:6), net \"disarm them\" (Cheyne); for the chief royal weapons were the spear and the bow, neither of which was carried at the girdle. To open before him the two-leaved gates. The cities and forts repro-sented on the Assyrian monuments have invariably their gateways closed by two large gates or doors which meet in the centre of the gateway. The bronze plating found at Ballarat gave the dimensions, and showed the strength of such gates ('Transactions of the Society of Bibl. Archseol.,' vol. 7. pp. 83-88).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah45:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTI will go before thee, and make the crooked places straight: I will break in pieces the gates of brass, and cut in sunder the bars of iron:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 2. - I will... make the crooked places straight; rather, I will make the rugged places level. No doubt intended generally, \"I will smooth his way before him.\" The gates of brass... the bars of iron. According to Herodotus, the gates of Babylon were of solid bronze, and one hundred in number (1:179). Solid bronze gates have, however, nowhere been found, and would have been inconvenient from their enormous weight. It is probable that the \"gates of brass,\" or \"bronze,\" whereof we read, were always, like these found at Ballarat, of wood plated with bronze. To the eye these would be \"gates of bronze.\" Gates of towns were, as a matter of course, secured by bars, which would commonly be made of iron, as the strongest material. Iron was well known to the Babylonians (Herod., 1:186).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah45:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd I will give thee the treasures of darkness, and hidden riches of secret places, that thou mayest know that I, the LORD, which call thee by thy name, am the God of Israel.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 3. - I will give thee the treasures of darkness; i.e. \"treasures stored in dark places\" - \"bidden treasures.\" Treasuries were built for greater security without windows. Of the treasures which fell into the hands of Cyrus, the greatest were probably those of Babylon (Herod., 1:183) and of Sardis (Xen., 'Cyrop.,' 7:2, § 11). The value of the latter has been estimated at above one hundred and twenty-six millions sterling. That thou mayest know; or, acknowledge (for the actual acknowledgment, see the decrees in Ezra 1:3 and Ezra 6:3-5). If these documents are accepted as genuine, or even as true in substance (Ewald), Cyrus must be considered to have identified Jehovah with his own Ormuzd, and to have viewed the Jewish and Persian religions as substantially the same. He would be under no temptation, with so weak and down-trodden a people as the Jews, to resort to politic pretences, as he might be in the case of the Babylonians (see the comment on Isaiah 41:25). Which call thee by thy name (comp. ver. 1 and Isaiah 44:28). (On the special favour implied in God's condescending to \"know\" or \"call\" a person by his name, see the 'Pulpit Commentary' on Exodus 33:12.) Am the God of Israel; rather, am the Lord... the God of Israel.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah45:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor Jacob my servant's sake, and Israel mine elect, I have even called thee by thy name: I have surnamed thee, though thou hast not known me.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 4. - For Jacob my servant's sake. This second motive is, in a certain sense, the main one. Cyrus is raised up, especially, to perform God's pleasure with respect to Judah and Jerusalem (Isaiah 44:26-28). Jacob, his Church, is more important in God's eyes than any individual. No doubt his Church is maintained, in part, that it may be \"a light to lighten the Gentiles;\" but it is not maintained solely: or even mainly, for this end. Its welfare is an end in itself, and would be sought by God apart from any further consequence. Israel mine elect (comp. Isaiah 41:8; Isaiah 44:1). I have surnamed thee; i.e. \"given thee designations of honour,\" e.g. \"my anointed\" (ver. 1); \"my shepherd\" (Isaiah 44:28); \"he who shall do all my pleasure\" (Isaiah 44:28). Though thou hast not known me; rather, though thou didst not know me. Cyrus's honours, his titles, his mention by name, etc., were accumulated upon him before his birth, when he knew nothing of God, when, therefore, he had in no way merited them. Thus all was done, not for his sake, but lot the sake of Israel.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah45:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTI am the LORD, and there is none else, there is no God beside me: I girded thee, though thou hast not known me:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 5. - I girded thee. As God \"loosed the loins\" of Cyrus's adversaries (ver. 1), to weaken them, so he \"girded\" those of Cyrus, to give him strength (comp. Psalm 18:32).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah45:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThat they may know from the rising of the sun, and from the west, that there is none beside me.

The attention of all the world from the extreme east to the extreme west, would be drawn by the wonderful occurrences. Jehovah's hand in them would be perceived, and his sole Godhead would obtain acknowledgment. An impulse was doubtless given to monotheism by the victories of Cyrus and the favour which he showed the Jews; but it cannot be said to have been very marked. Idolatry and polytheism were to a certain extent discredited; but they maintained their ground nevertheless. It was not till the true \"Anointed One\" appeared - the antitype of whom Cyrus was the type - that the idols were \"utterly abolished.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah45:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTI form the light, and create darkness: I make peace, and create evil: I the LORD do all these things.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 7. - I form the light, and create darkness. It has been recently denied that there is any allusion in these words, or in those which follow, to the Zoroastrian tenets; and it has even been asserted that the religion of the early Achaemenian kings was free from the taint of dualism. But according to some authorities, \"a god of lies\" is mentioned in the Behistun inscription; and the evidence is exceedingly strong that dualism was an essential part of the Zoroastrian religion long before the time of Cyrus (see 'Ancient Monarchies,' vol. 2. pp. 332, 333, 2nd edit.). It is quite reasonable to suppose that Isaiah would be acquainted with the belief of the Persians and Medes, who had come in contact with the Assyrians as early as B.C.. 830; and a warning against the chief error of their religion would be quite in place when he was holding up Cyrus to his countrymen as entitled to their respect and veneration. The nexus of the words, \"I am the Lord, and there is none else. I form the light, and create darkness,\" is such as naturally to suggest an intended antagonism to the Zoroastrian system. Under that, Ormuzd created \"light\" and \"peace,\" Ahriman \"darkness\" and \"evil.\" The two were eternal adversaries, engaged in an inter-ruinable contest. Ormuzd, it is true, claimed the undivided allegiance of mankind, since he was their maker; but Ahriman was a great power, terribly formidable - perhaps a god (diva) - certainly the chief of the devas. It was from Zoroastrianism that Manicheism derived its doctrine of the two principles, and to the same source may, with much probability, be traced the \"devil-worshippers\" of the Zagros mountain chain.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah45:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTDrop down, ye heavens, from above, and let the skies pour down righteousness: let the earth open, and let them bring forth salvation, and let righteousness spring up together; I the LORD have created it.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 8. - THE BLESSED RESULTS OF ISRAEL'S DELIVERANCE. The restoration of Israel to their own land will be followed by a great increase of righteousness and salvation. They will be, as it were, showered down abundantly from heaven, while at the same time they will spring in profusion from earth's bosom. Jehovah, who has caused the deliverance, will also cause these results to follow from it. Verse 8. - Drop down, ye heavens; literally, distil, ye heavens (camp. Deuteronomy 32:1; Job 36:28); or rain down on the thirsty earth your gracious influences. Let righteousness, or God's law of right, descend afresh from the skies as a boon to mankind - a boon for which they have been long waiting. And... let the earth open. Let earth make due response, opening her gentle besom, as she does in spring (camp. Aprilis from aperio), and blossoming with human righteousness, the fruit and evidence of salvation. To the prophet's rapt gaze the excellence of the post-Captivity times, when all idolatry had been put away, seemed, in comparison with earlier ages, the reign of justice and truth upon earth. I the Lord have created it; i.e. \"I, Jehovah, have wrought the change by the larger outpouring of my Spirit\" (camp. Isaiah 43:3).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah45:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWoe unto him that striveth with his Maker! Let the potsherd strive with the potsherds of the earth. Shall the clay say to him that fashioneth it, What makest thou? or thy work, He hath no hands?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 9-13. - ISRAEL WARNED NOT TO CALL IN QUESTION GOD'S MODES OF ACTION. Apparently, Isaiah anticipates that the Israelites will be discontented and murmur at their deliverer being a heathen king, and not one of their own body. He therefore warns them against presuming to criticize the arrangements of the All-Wise, reminding them of his unapproachable greatness (ver. 12), and once more assuring them that the appointment of Cyrus is from him (ver. 13). Verse 9. - Woe unto him that striveth with his Maker! Let the potsherd strive, etc.; rather, woe unto him that striveth with his Maker, a potsherd among potsherds of the ground: All men are equally made of \"the dust of the ground\" (Genesis 2:7). Israel has no prerogative in this respect. He, too, is \"a potsherd among potsherds\" - day moulded by the potter; no more entitled to lift up his voice against his Maker than the vessel to rebel against the man who shapes it (comp. Isaiah 29:16; and see the comment furnished by St. Paul in the Epistle to the Romans 9:20-24). What would a man think if the clay that he was fashioning objected to being moulded in a particular form, or if a work that he had made exclaimed, \"He is a poor bungler - he hath no hands\"? Yet this is what a man does who finds fault with the arrangements of the Almighty.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah45:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWoe unto him that saith unto his father, What begettest thou? or to the woman, What hast thou brought forth?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 10. - Woe unto him that saith unto his father, etc.! A change is made in the metaphor, the relationship of a father and his child being substituted for that of a potter and his clay. What would a man think of a child murmuring against his parent for not having made him stronger, handsomer, cleverer? Would not such a child be regarded as most unnatural, and as deserving to have woe denounced upon him?NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah45:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThus saith the LORD, the Holy One of Israel, and his Maker, Ask me of things to come concerning my sons, and concerning the work of my hands command ye me.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 11. - The Holy One of Israel; i.e. he who always does right, and with whom, therefore, it is absurd to find fault. His Maker; i.e. Israel's Maker, who has, therefore, the right to do with him as he pleases. Ask me of things to come concerning my sons. This sentence is wrongly punctuated. The last three words should be attached to what follows, thus: \"Ask me of things to come: concerning my sons and concerning the work of my hands command ye me;\" i.e. first learn of me what in my designs is to be the course of human events, and then (if necessary) give me directions concerning my sons (Israel), who are the work of my hands; but do not presume to give me directions while you are still in utter ignorance of my designs. In any case remember who I am - the Maker of heaven and earth, the Creator of man, One accustomed to give directions to the angelic host (ver. 12).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah45:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTI have made the earth, and created man upon it: I, even my hands, have stretched out the heavens, and all their host have I commanded.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 12. - I, even my hands; literally, I, my hands; i.e. \"my hands, and my hands alone.\" All their host. The \"host of heaven\" is sometimes put for the stars, and may be so understood here; but \"commands\" are laid on intelligent rather than on unintelligent beings. (The object of the verb tsavah in Hebrew is almost always personal.)NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah45:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTI have raised him up in righteousness, and I will direct all his ways: he shall build my city, and he shall let go my captives, not for price nor reward, saith the LORD of hosts.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 13. - I have raised him up. \"Him\" can only be referred to Cyrus, the one individual mentioned previously in the chapter (vers. 1-5). The expression,\" raised up,\" had been already used of him (Isaiah 41:25). In righteousness means \"to carry out my righteous purposes.\" I will direct; rather, as in the margin, make straight. He... shall let go my captives, not for price nor reward. Captives were often \"redeemed for a price\" (Nehemiah 6:8). In Greece a fixed sum was established by general consent as the ransom of a captive (Aristot., 'Eth. Nic.,' 5:6). Cyrus, however, in letting the Jews go free, would not be actuated by the paltry motive of pecuniary profit. He may, as Mr. Cheyne remarks, have been actuated in part \"by a consideration of the usefulness of such a faithful advanced guard at the border of Egypt;\" but mainly it is probable that \"he obeyed the dictates of religious sympathy with the Jews.\" The recent contention, that he was not a Zoroastrian (Sayce, Academy, October 16, 1880; 'Ancient Empires,' p. 439; Cheyne, 'Isaiah,' vol. 2. p. 279) rests upon insufficient evidence, his so-called inscription being a document not put forth by himself, but by the priests of Merodach at Babylon; and the first introduction of Zoroastrian monotheism into the state religion of Persia by Darius Hystaspis (Sayce, 'Ancient Empires,' p. 440) being expressly disclaimed by him in the Be-histun inscription, where he declares his reformation to have consisted in the rebuilding of the temples which Gomates the Magian had destroyed, and the reinstitutier for the state of the religious chants and the worship which he had put down (col 1. par. 14).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah45:14VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThus saith the LORD, The labour of Egypt, and merchandise of Ethiopia and of the Sabeans, men of stature, shall come over unto thee, and they shall be thine: they shall come after thee; in chains they shall come over, and they shall fall down unto thee, they shall make supplication unto thee, saying, Surely God is in thee; and there is none else, there is no God.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 14-25. - THE CONVERSION' OF THE GENTILES A CONSEQUENCE OF THE RESTORATION AND SALVATION OF ISRAEL. \"With the prospect of the release of the exiles is associated,\" says Delitzsch, \"in the prophet's perspective, the prospect of an expansion of the restored Church, through the entrance of the fulness of the Gentiles.\" Egypt, Ethiopia, and Saba are especially mentioned here, as in Isaiah 43:3, as among the first to come in (vers. 14, 15). Later on, a more general influx is spoken of (ver. 20); and, finally, a prospect is held out of an ultimate universal conversion (ver. 23). At the same time, judgment is denounced against the idolaters who persist in their idolatry (vers. 16, 20), and they are warned that they will have no share in the coming glories of the Israel of God. Verse 14. - The labour of Egypt, and merchandise of Ethiopia and of the Sabaeans; i.e. \"the laborious Egyptians, and the traffic-loving Ethiopians and Sabaeans.\" Their buildings and their husbandry alike justify what is said of the Egyptians, while the very ancient traffic between Egypt and Ethiopia is sufficient ground for the assignment of a commercial character to the Ethiopians and the Sabaeans. Men of stature. (On the tall stature of the Ethiopians, see Herod., 3:20; and comp. Isaiah 18:2, with the comment.) Shall come over unto thee. Knobel understands that they would give their aid to the rebuilding of the temple; but this they certainly did not do, and Isaiah's words certainly do not imply it. He is again speaking of the great conversion of the nations, which he connected with the restoration of the Jews to their own land (Isaiah 11:12; Isaiah 18:7; Isaiah 19:18-25, etc.), and which may be considered to have begun then, but only to have had its full accomplishment in the Messianic period. In chains they shall come over. Ready to serve the Church as slaves and servants - not literally wearing chains. They shall fall down unto thee, etc. The Church, as informed with the Spirit of God, shall Seem to them a holy thing, and therefore an object of worship (romp. Revelation 3:9). There is such a union between Christ and his Church, that worship, in a qualified sense, may be paid the Church without unfitness.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah45:15VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTVerily thou art a God that hidest thyself, O God of Israel, the Saviour.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 15. - Verily thou art a God that hidest thyself. Some commentators regard this as an exclamation made by Isaiah himself, who marvels at the unsearchable mystery of God's ways. But others, with better reason, take it for a continuation of the speech of the converted heathen, who marvel that God has so long hid himself from them and from the world at large, not manifesting his power, as he has now done in the person of Cyrus. In this recent manifestation he has shown himself especially the God of Israel, and their Saviour.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah45:16VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThey shall be ashamed, and also confounded, all of them: they shall go to confusion together that are makers of idols.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 16. - They shall be ashamed... shall go to confusion; rather, ore ashamed... are gone to confusion - the \"perfect of prophetic certainty.\" While the heathen that join themselves to Israel partake of their glory and salvation, such as abide by their idols are covered with shame and confusion.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah45:17VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut Israel shall be saved in the LORD with an everlasting salvation: ye shall not be ashamed nor confounded world without end.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 17. - Israel shall be saved... with an everlasting salvation; literally, a salvation of ages; i.e. one which will continue age after age. As Mr. Cheyne remarks, for this to be so, the redemption required to be spiritual as well as temporal. Otherwise it would ere long have been forfeited.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah45:18VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor thus saith the LORD that created the heavens; God himself that formed the earth and made it; he hath established it, he created it not in vain, he formed it to be inhabited: I am the LORD; and there is none else.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 18. - Thus saith the Lord, etc. Translate, Thus saith the Lord that created the heavens - he is God - that formed the earth and made it; he established it; he created it not a chaos, but formed it to be inhabited: I am the Lord, and there is none else. As God had not formed the earth to be a material chaos, but had introduced into it order and arrangement, so he willed his spiritual creation to be recovered out of the confusion into which it had fallen, and to be established in righteousness.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah45:19VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTI have not spoken in secret, in a dark place of the earth: I said not unto the seed of Jacob, Seek ye me in vain: I the LORD speak righteousness, I declare things that are right.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 19. - I have not spoken in secret, in a dark place of the earth; literally, in a place of the land of darkness. Jehovah's oracles have not been given, like those of the necromancers, or those of the heathen gods, in dark places of the earth - caves like that of Trophonius (Pansan., 9:29, § 2), or the inmost recesses (adyta) of temples; but openly on Sinai, or by the mouth of prophets who proclaimed his words to all Israel (romp. Dent. 30:11-14, \"This commandment which I command thee this day, is not hidden from thee, neither is it far off... . But the word is very nigh unto thee, in thy mouth, and in thy heart, that thou mayest do it\"). So our Lord says of his own teaching, \"I spake openly to the world; I ever taught in the synagogue, and in the temple, whither the Jews always resort; and in secret have I said nothing\" (John 18:20). Seek ye me in vain; rather, seek ye me as a chaos (romp. Jeremiah 2:31, where God says to his people, \"Have I been a wilderness unto Israel? a land of darkness?\"). God has no more revealed himself to his people as chaotic, confused, disordered, than he has presented the world to them in this condition.! the Lord speak righteousness, I declare things that are right. There is an allusion to the crooked and ambiguous utterances of the heathen oracles, which rarely gave direct answers or plainly expressed any definite meaning. God in his utterances never diverges from the straight line of righteousness and truth (comp. Proverbs 8:6).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah45:20VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAssemble yourselves and come; draw near together, ye that are escaped of the nations: they have no knowledge that set up the wood of their graven image, and pray unto a god that cannot save.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 20. - Assemble yourselves and come... ye... escaped of the nations. The prophet reverts to the main idea of the section, which is the conversion of the Gentiles, and calls on all \"the escaped of the nation\" - i.e. all who have survived the judgments of the time - to \"assemble and come,\" to consider the claims of Jehovah to be the only true God, to \"look to him (ver. 22) and be saved.\" The great judgments through which the heathen will be brought to God have been frequently mentioned (Isaiah 24:1-23; Isaiah 26:20, 21; Isaiah 27:1-7; Isaiah 30:27-33; Isaiah 34:1-10; Isaiah 40:24; Isaiah 41:11, 12, 25; Isaiah 42:13-15, etc.). They must not be regarded as limited to the time of Cyrus, but rather as continuing into the Messianic period, and indeed nearly to its close (see especially ch. 34.). Each one of them constitutes a call to the nations, and is followed by a conversion to a greater or less extent. They have no knowledge that set up the wood of their graven image; rather, who lift up (or, carry) the wood of their graven image (comp. Isaiah 46:7, \"They bear him upon the shoulder,\" where the same verb is used). It was a practice of the idolatrous heathen to carry the images of their gods in processions, generally exposed to view upon their shoulders (Layard, 'Nineveh and its Remains,' vol. 2. opp. p. 451), but sometimes partially concealed in shrines, or \"arks\" (Rawlinson, 'Herodotus,' vol. 2. pp. 100, 101). There would be still among the \"escaped\" some who would so act.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah45:21VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTTell ye, and bring them near; yea, let them take counsel together: who hath declared this from ancient time? who hath told it from that time? have not I the LORD? and there is no God else beside me; a just God and a Saviour; there is none beside me.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 21. - Tell ye, and bring them near. Dr. Kay and Mr. Cheyne understand the nations to be addressed, and told to \"show\" or \"announce,\" and \"bring forth\" or \"produce,\" any argument in favour of the divinity of their gods. But it is simpler and better, with our translators, to regard the address as made to the prophets of God, who are bidden to announce his message of mercy to the nations, and to bring them near to him (comp. Isaiah 40:1). Let them take counsel together; i.e. let the nations consider one with another, whether God or the idols be the fitter object of worship. Who hath declared this? \"This\" must refer to the conquest of Babylon and deliverance of Israel by Cyrus. None but Jehovah had ever announced this - none but he could bring it to pass. From ancient time; rather, from aforetime (Cheyne). The announcement cannot have been made very long before this prophecy was delivered. A just God and a Saviour. A God in whom \"mercy and truth meet together, righteousness and peace kiss each other\" (Psalm 85:16); who can be at once just, \"acting stringently according to the demands of his holiness\" (Delitzsch), and yet design and effect the salvation of sinners.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah45:22VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTLook unto me, and be ye saved, all the ends of the earth: for I am God, and there is none else.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 22. - Look unto me; rather, turn unto me (as in Psalm 25:16; Psalm 69:16; Psalm 86:16); i.e., \"Be converted - turn unto the Lord your God.\" It is implied that all can turn, if they will. And be ye saved. On conversion, salvation will follow. It will extend even to all the ends of the earth (comp. Psalm 98:3, \"All the ends of the earth have seen the salvation of our God\").NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah45:23VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTI have sworn by myself, the word is gone out of my mouth in righteousness, and shall not return, That unto me every knee shall bow, every tongue shall swear.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 23. - I have sworn by myself (comp. Genesis 22:17; Jeremiah 22:5; Jeremiah 49:15). \"God swears \"by himself,\" because he can swear by no greater\" (Hebrews 6:13). He condescends, for man's sake, to confirm in this way promises that are exceedingly precious (see the Homiletics on Isaiah 14:24). The word is gone out of my mouth in righteousness. So Dr. Kay and Mr. Cheyne (comp. ver. 19, \"I the Lord speak righteousness\"). And shall not return; i.e. shall not be withdrawn or retracted. God's gifts and promises are \"without repentance.\" Every knee shall bow, every tongue shall swear. This universal turning to God belongs to the final Messianic kingdom, prophesied in Isaiah 2:2-4; Isaiah 11:6-9; Isaiah 35:1-10; Isaiah 65:17-25; Isaiah 66:18-23; and also by Daniel (Daniel 7:9-14) and St. John the Divine (Revelation 21:1-4).

Among the direct consequences of the victories of Cyrus will be the downfall, in a certain sense, of the Babylonian idolatry. The prophet expresses the downfall by material imagery, graphically describing the fate of the idols themselves. But we must regard him as exulting mainly in the thought of the blow that would be dealt to idolatry in general, and to the Babylonian fond of it in particular, by the substitution of the non-idolatrous and almost monotheistic Persians for the polytheistic and grossly idolatrous Babylonians, in the sovereignty of the Asiatic world. The Babylonian religion no doubt maintained itself at Babylon until and beyond the time of Alexander; but it had lost all its prestige. From the state religion of the chief empire of Western Asia, it had sunk to the position of a provincial cult. Verse 1. - Bel boweth down, Nebo stoopeth. In the later Babylonian period, to which Isaiah's prophetic vision transports him, Bel and Nebo (if we understand by Bel, Bel-Merodach) were decidedly the two principal gods. Of the seven kings of the last dynasty, three had names in which Nebo, and two names in which Bel or Merodach, wad an element. Bel-Merodach and Nebo are the chief gods worshipped by Nebuchadnezzar and Neriglissar. Bel, Nebo, and Merodach are the only three Babylonian gods that receive acknowledgment from Cyrus in the so-called 'Cyrus Cylinder.' Bel is, in the Babylonian, \"Bil,\" or \"Belu,\" and means simply \"lord.\" There was an ancient god of the name, one of the First Triad (Anu, Bel, and Hen or Hod), who came by degrees to be identified with Merodach, the tutelary deity of Babylon. Bel-Merodach was the Βῆλος (Belus) of the Greeks and Romans, who was worshipped in the great temple of Babylon, now represented by the ruin called \"Babil.\" His name forms an element in those of Bel-lush, Bel-kudur-azur, Bel-ipni. Bel-zakir-isknn, and Belshazzar, all of them kings or viceroys of either Babylonia or Assyria. Nebu was the Babylonian god of learning, and has therefore been compared to Mercury. He was the special deity of Borsippa. The name is thought to be etymologically connected with the Hebrew nabi, prophet. The \"bowing\" and \"stooping\" of Bel and Nebo has primary reference to the overthrow of their images by the conqueror; but includes also the idea of the fall of the gods themselves in the opinions of men. Their idols were upon the beasts. The Chaldean images generally - not only those of Bel-Merodach and Nebo, but also of Ann, and Hen, and Beltis, and Ishtar, and Nergal, and Sin, and Shamas, and Gula, and others - would be torn from their shrines, and placed upon the backs of beasts of burden, to be carried off by the conquerors. No doubt this was the case with a large number of the images, which were among the most precious of the spoils seized by the soldiers. But it appears that numerous exceptions were made. Neither Cyrus nor Cambyses touched the famous golden image of Bel-Merodach at Babylon, which was first carried off from the great temple by Xerxes (Herod., 1:183). Cyrus, moreover, restored various idols, which Nabonidus had taken to Babylon from provincial towns, to the temples to which they of right belonged (Journal of Royal Asiatic Society, January, 1880, art. it.). But though their fate was in tiffs way often delayed, ultimately it is probable every valuable idol was carried off and committed to the melting-pot. Your carriages were heavy loaden; rather, the things that ye carried (in procession) are now borne along heavily. The allusion is to the contrast between the light-hearted carrying of the images on festal occasions by their votaries (Isaiah 45:20), and their slow transport to foreign lands on the backs of wearied beasts.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah46:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThey stoop, they bow down together; they could not deliver the burden, but themselves are gone into captivity.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 2. - They stoop, they bow down together; i.e. all the Babylonian gods would suffer equally - not one would be able to protect himself. They could not deliver the burden. A distinction is here made between the god and the idol, which have hitherto been identified. The god was, in each case, unable to deliver, or save from capture, the heavy \"burden\" of gold, or silver, or bronze (i.e. his own image) which was carried off on the back of the \"weary beast.\" On the contrary, the gods themselves - the \"souls\" of the images, immanent in them - were carried off with the images into captivity.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah46:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHearken unto me, O house of Jacob, and all the remnant of the house of Israel, which are borne by me from the belly, which are carried from the womb:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 3-8. - AN ADMONITION TO ISRAEL. Israel should learn from the fate of the Babylonian idols to trust in Jehovah, who can and will deliver them, rather than in gods of gold and silver, which can give no aid, either to themselves or others. Verse 3. - All the remnant of the house of Israel. The address is not to those who had remained faithful of the ten tribes (as Delitzsch supposes), but to the captives of Babylon, designated in these later chapters indifferently as \"Jacob\" or \"Israel\" (Isaiah 40:27; Isaiah 41:8, 14; Isaiah 42:24; Isaiah 43:1, 28; Isaiah 44:1, 21, 23; Isaiah 45:4, etc.), never as \"Judah,\" and constantly mentioned as a \"remnant\" - all that was left of the oppressed and down-trodden nation (see Isaiah 1:9; Isaiah 10:20-22; Isaiah 11:16. etc.). Borne by me. Carried in the everlasting arms, as a child in the arms of its nurse or mother (comp. Isaiah 63:9). From the belly... from the womb. From the very beginning of the national existence.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah46:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd even to your old age I am he; and even to hoar hairs will I carry you: I have made, and I will bear; even I will carry, and will deliver you.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 4. - Even to your old age I am he; even to hoar hairs, etc. The nurse - even the mother - soon grows tired of carrying the child, and leaves him to shift for himself. But God's tender care for his people lasts from their infancy, through their boyhood and manhood, to their old age. The everlasting arms never weary. God's watchfulness, his providence, his protection, never fail. I have made, and I will bear.

Here, however, it is not the carrying in procession that is spoken of, but the conveyance of the imago by the workman from his own workshop to the temple where it is to be set up. The carrying of heavy burdens upon the shoulder is mentioned by Herodotus (2:35), and frequently represented on ancient monuments (see 'Ancient Monarchies,' vol. 1. pp. 402, 475; 'Herodotus,' vol. 2. pl. opp. p. 177; etc.). From his place shall he net remove; i.e. he (the god) will have no power of moving an inch from the spot on which he is set up.

Remember, he says to them, or \"bear in mind constantly the impotence of the idols, and the power of Jehovah, and then stand firm - remain in your old faith - do not be drawn over to so foolish a thing as idolatry.\" O ye transgressors.

The imagery is quite natural, and exactly parallel to that by which Nebuchadnezzar is termed \"an eagle,\" both by Jeremiah (Jeremiah 49:22) and Ezekiel (Ezekiel 17:3). There is no need to suppose any allusion to the fact, if fact it be, that the Persians from the time of Cyrus had for a standard a golden eagle, with wings outspread, on the top of a spear-shaft (Xen., 'Cyrop.,' 7:1, § 4; 'Anab.,' 1:10, § 12). From the east (comp. Isaiah 41:2, 25). Both Persia and Susiana, which were the primary seats of the power of Cyrus, lay to the east of Babylon, the latter due east, the former somewhat to the south-east.

The speaker is either Jehovah (see ver. 3, ad fin.) or \"a chorus of celestial beings\" (Cheyne), bent on expressing their sympathy with Israel Verse 1. - Come down, and sit in the dust; i.e. \"descend to the lowest depth of humiliation\" (comp. Isaiah 3:26 and Job 2:8). O virgin daughter of Babylon. The \"virgin daughter of Babylon\" is the Babylonian people as distinct from the city (comp. Isaiah 23:12). \"Virgin\" does not mean \"unconquered;\" for Babylon had been taken by the Assyrians some half-dozen times ('Ancient Monarchies,' vol. 2, pp. 58, 130, 149, 157, 164, 175, etc.). Sit on the ground: there is no throne; rather, sit on the ground throneless, or without a throne. Hitherto the \"virgin daughter\" had sat, as it were, on a throne, ruling the nations. Now she must sit on the ground - there was no throne left for her. It is the fact that Babylon was never, after her capture by Cyrus, the capital. of a kingdom. Under the Achsemenian kings she was the residence of the court for a part of the year; but Susa was the capital. Under Alexander she was designated for his capital; but he died before his designs could be carried out. Under the Seleucidae she rapidly dwindled in consequence, until she became a ruin. Thou shalt no more be called tender and delicate; or, delicate and luxurious (Cheyne). Babylon had hitherto been one of the chief seats of Oriental luxury. She was \"the glory of kingdoms, the beauty of the Chaldees' excellency\" (Isaiah 13:19), \"the golden city\" (Isaiah 14:4). She was given to revelry and feasting, to mirth and drunkenness, to a shameless licensed debauchery (Herod., 1. 199; Baruch 6:43). All this would now be changed. Her population would have to perform the hard duties laid upon them by foreign masters.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah47:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTTake the millstones, and grind meal: uncover thy locks, make bare the leg, uncover the thigh, pass over the rivers.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 2. - Take the millstones, and grind meal.

On the way from their own city to the land of their captivity, they would have to wade through streams, and in so doing to expose parts of their persons which delicacy required to be concealed.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah47:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThy nakedness shall be uncovered, yea, thy shame shall be seen: I will take vengeance, and I will not meet thee as a man.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 3. - I will not meet thee as a man; literally, I shall not meet a man; i.e. \"I shall not find any one to oppose me.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah47:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAs for our redeemer, the LORD of hosts is his name, the Holy One of Israel.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 4. - As for our Redeemer, etc. Mr. Cheyne suspects, with some reason, that this is \"the marginal note of a sympathetic scribe, which has made its way by accident into the text.\" It is certainly quite unlike anything else in the song, which would artistically be improved by its removal. If, however, it be retained, we must regard it as a parenthetic ejaculation of the Jewish Church on hearing the first strophe of the song - the Church contrasting itself with Babylon, which has no one to stand up for it, whereas it has as \"Redeemer the Lord of hosts, the Holy One of Israel.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah47:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTSit thou silent, and get thee into darkness, O daughter of the Chaldeans: for thou shalt no more be called, The lady of kingdoms.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 5. - Sit thou silent, and get thee into darkness. The second strophe begins, like the first, with a double imperative. The fallen people is recommended to hide its shame in silence and darkness, as disgraced persons do who shrink from being seen by their fellows. Thou shalt no more be called The lady of kingdoms. Babylon can scarcely have borne this title in Isaiah's time, or at any earlier period, unless it were a very remote one. She had been secondary to Assyria for at least six hundred years when Isaiah wrote, and under Sennacherib was ruled by viceroys of his appointment. But Isaiah's prophetic foresight enables him to realize the later period of Babylon's prosperity and glory under Nabopolassar and Nebuchadnezzar, when she became the inheritress of the greatness of Assyria, and exercised rule over a large portion of Western Asia. Nebuchadnezzar was, no doubt, as he is called by both Ezekiel (Ezekiel 26:7) and Daniel (Daniel 2:37), a \"king of kings;\" and Babylon was then an empress-state, exercising authority over many minor kingdoms. It is clear that, both in the earlier and the later chapters, the prophet realizes this condition of things (see Isaiah 13:19; Isaiah 14:4-6, 12-17; as well as the present passage).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah47:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTI was wroth with my people, I have polluted mine inheritance, and given them into thine hand: thou didst shew them no mercy; upon the ancient hast thou very heavily laid thy yoke.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 6. - I was wroth with my people (comp. 2 Kings 24:3, 4; 2 Chronicles 36:13-17). I have polluted... and given; rather, I polluted and gave. The reference is to the conquest of Judaea by Nebuchadnezzar. Thou didst show them no mercy. We have very little historical knowledge of the general treatment of the Jewish exiles during the Captivity. A certain small number - Daniel and the Three Children - were advanced to positions of importance (Daniel 1:19; Daniel 2:48, 49; Daniel 3:30), and, on the whole, well treated. On the other hand, Jehoiachin underwent an imprisonment of thirty-seven years' duration (2 Kings 25:27). Mr. Cheyne says that \"the writings of Jeremiah and Ezekiel do not suggest that the [bulk of the] exiles were great sufferers.\" This is, no doubt, true; and we may, perhaps, regard Isaiah's words in this place as sufficiently made good by the \"cruelties which disfigured the first days of the Babylonian triumph\" (Lamentations 4:16; Lamentations 5:12; 2 Chronicles 36:17). Still, there may well have been a large amount of suffering among the rank-and-file of the captives, of which no historic record has come down to us. Psalm 138. reveals some of the bitter feelings of the exiles. Upon the ancient; rather, upon the aged. The author of Chronicles notes that Nebuchadnezzar, on taking Jerusalem, \"had no compassion on young man or maiden, old man or him that stooped for age\" (l.s.c.). There is no reason for giving the words of the present passage an allegorical meaning.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah47:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd thou saidst, I shall be a lady for ever: so that thou didst not lay these things to thy heart, neither didst remember the latter end of it.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 7. - And thou saidst, I shall be a lady for ever. The idea of \"continuance\" is one of the primary instincts of human nature. Hence we regard it as certain that the sun will rise on the morrow. We expect things to \"continue in one stay,\" and \"to-morrow to be as to-day,\" if not even \"more abundant.\" Babylon was not much more arrogant than other nations when she assumed that silo would be \"a lady for ever.\" And she had more excuse than almost any other nation. Her capital was one of the most ancient cities, if not the most ancient city in the world (Genesis 10:10 ). Though not unconquered (see the comment on ver. 1), she had yet for two millennia or more maintained a prominent position among the chief peoples of the earth, and had finally risen to a prouder eminence than any that she had previously occupied. Still, she ought to have remembered that \"all things come to an end,\" and to have so comported herself in the time of her prosperity as not to have provoked God to anger. So that thou didst not lay these things to thy heart. \"These things\" must refer to the calamities about to fall upon Babylon, of which she may have heard before the end came - since they had been prophesied so long previously - but which she did not take to heart. The latter end of it; i.e. \"the probable issue of her pride and cruelty\" (Kay).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah47:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTTherefore hear now this, thou that art given to pleasures, that dwellest carelessly, that sayest in thine heart, I am, and none else beside me; I shall not sit as a widow, neither shall I know the loss of children:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 8. - Therefore; rather, and now. The third strophe begins here, but with a single, instead of a double, imperative. So also the fourth strophe in ver. 12. Thou that art given to pleasures (see the comment on ver. 1, sub fin.). That dwellest carelessly; or, that sittest securely; i.e. in an imagined security. Herodotus says that, when Cyrus invested the city, the inhabitants \"made light of his siege\" (1:190), and occupied themselves \"in dancing and revelry\" (1:191). The Nabonidus Tablet seems to show that very slight and insufficient preparations for defence were made.! am, and none else Beside me. This is not self-deification, but only a boast of superiority to all other earthly powers. Zephaniah expresses in exactly similar terms the pride and arrogance of Assyria (Zephaniah 2:15). I shall not sit as a widow; i.e. in solitude and desolation (Lamentations 1:1), deserted by the crowds who had sought her marts and delighted in her luxury. This result, which now impended, had never been anticipated by the \"careless\" one, who had expected to be for ever \"the lady of kingdoms.\" The loss of children; i.e. diminution of population.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah47:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut these two things shall come to thee in a moment in one day, the loss of children, and widowhood: they shall come upon thee in their perfection for the multitude of thy sorceries, and for the great abundance of thine enchantments.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 9. - In a moment in one day. The day of the capture of the city by Cyrus, which was the third of Marchesvan, B.C. 539. Then, \"in a moment,\" Babylon lost the whole of her prestige, ceased to reign, ceased to be an independent power, became a \"widow,\" had a portion of her population turn from her, was brought down to the dust. Loss of children, and widowhood came upon her in their perfection; i.e. \"in the full extent of their bitterness\" (Cheyne). Not that Cyrus imitated her common practice by carrying off her entire population; on the contrary, she continued for more than two centuries to be a flourishing and populous town. Twice she revolted from Darius Hystaspis ('Beh. Ins.,' col. 1. par. 16; col 3, par. 13), once, perhaps, from Xerxes (Ctes., 'Ext. Pers,' § 22). Alexander the Great found her walls and her great buildings in ruins, but still she was a considerable place. Cyrus, however, no doubt, carried off a portion of her population, which thenceforth begun to dwindle, and continually became less and less as time went on, until she sank into a solitude. That extreme desolation which the prophets paint in such vivid colours (Isaiah 12:19-22; 14:22, 23; Jeremiah 50:10:15, 38-40; 2:36-43) was potentially contained in the capture by Cyrus, which was the work of a single day. For the multitude of thy sorceries... of thine enchantments (comp. ver. 13; and see also Daniel 2:2; Daniel 5:7). The word here translated \"sorceries\" probably means \"incantations\" or \"enchantments,\" while that translated \"enchantments\" means \"spells.\" The addiction of the Babylonians to marc is largely attested by the classical writers, and has been proved beyond a doubt by the lately discovered native remains. By these it appears that their magic fell under three principal heads:NEWLINENEWLINE(1) the preparation and use of spells and talismans, which were written forms engraved on stone or impressed on clay, and worn on the person or attached to the object on which their influence was to be exerted;NEWLINENEWLINE(2) the composition and recitation of formulae of incantation, which were supposed to act as charms, and to drive away demons and diseases; andNEWLINENEWLINE(3) the taking of observations and framing of tables of prognostics and of omens for general use, together with the casting of horoscopes for the special advantage of individuals (see Rawlinson's 'Egypt and Babylon,' p. 58; and comp. Lenor, mant,'La Magic chez les Chaldaens,' and Professor Sayce's papers in the 'Transactions of the Society of Bibl. Archaeol.,' vol. 3:p. 145, et seqq.; vol. 4:p. 302, et seqq.). The first and second forms of marc are glanced at in the present passage; the third is noticed in ver. 13.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah47:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor thou hast trusted in thy wickedness: thou hast said, None seeth me. Thy wisdom and thy knowledge, it hath perverted thee; and thou hast said in thine heart, I am, and none else beside me.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 10. - Thou hast trusted in thy wickedness; i.e. in thy incantations and spells, which were supposed to work in secret, and which could not be counteracted if their victim was not aware of them. Thy wisdom and thy knowledge, it hath perverted thee. The astronomical \"wisdom and knowledge\" of the Babylonians, confessed by the Greeks to have been the origin of their own astronomical knowledge (Plat., 'Epiuomis,' p. 987; Hipparch. ap. Procl., 'In Tim.,' p. 71; Phoenix Coloph. ap. Athen., 'Deipnos.,' 12:p. 530, E.; Diod. Sic., 2 31, etc.), led them on to that perversion of true science, astrology, which, when once entered upon, seduces the mind from all genuine and fruitful study of the celestial phenomena, and leads it into a labyrinth of absurdities. It also puffed them up, and made them regard themselves as altogether superior to other nations (see the comment on ver. 8, sub fin.).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah47:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTTherefore shall evil come upon thee; thou shalt not know from whence it riseth: and mischief shall fall upon thee; thou shalt not be able to put it off: and desolation shall come upon thee suddenly, which thou shalt not know.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 11. - Therefore shall evil come upon thee. Connect this with the first clause of ver. 10, \"Thou hast trusted in thine own evil (moral), therefore shall evil (physical) fall upon thee.\" The same word, ra'ah, is used in both places. Thou shalt not know from whence it riseth. So the Vulgate, Vitringa, Gesenius, and Dr. Kay. But the bulk of modern commentators (Hitzig, Ewald, Delitzsch, Nagelsbach, Weir, Cheyne) render, \"Thou wilt not know how to charm it away.\" Both meanings are possible, and are almost equally good; but the parallelism of the clauses is in favour of the latter rendering. Shakhrah should correspond in construction, as in sound, with kapp'rah. To put it off; literally, to expiate; i.e. to get rid of it by means of expiatory rites. Which thou shalt not know; or, of which thou shalt not be aware. (On the carelessness and want of foresight displayed by the Babylonians, see the comment on ver. 8.)NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah47:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTStand now with thine enchantments, and with the multitude of thy sorceries, wherein thou hast laboured from thy youth; if so be thou shalt be able to profit, if so be thou mayest prevail.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 12. - Stand now. The fourth and concluding strophe now begins; it opens, like the third, with a single imperative. It has, as Mr. Cheyne observes, \"a strongly ironical tinge, reminding us of Elijah's language to the priests of Baal in 1 Kings 18:27.\" The irony is, however, confined to the first half (vers. 12, 13); giving place in vers. 14 and 15 to a scathing sentence of judgment and ruin. Enchantments... sorceries; rather, spells, enchantments (see the comment on ver. 9). If so be, etc.; rather, perchance thou wilt be able to profit; perchance thou wilt cause terror. The prophet gives a pretended encouragement to Israel's adversaries. \"If Babylon uses all the resources of her magical art, perhaps she may succeed - who knows? Perhaps she may strike terror into the hearts of her assailants.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah47:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThou art wearied in the multitude of thy counsels. Let now the astrologers, the stargazers, the monthly prognosticators, stand up, and save thee from these things that shall come upon thee.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 13. - Thou art wearied in the multitude of thy counsels. Mr. Cheyne's rendering is more intelligible, \"Thou hast wearied thyself with the multitude of thy consultations.\" Those at the head of affairs had consulted the diviners of all classes, till they were utterly weary of so doing (compare the \"consultations\" of Nebuchadnezzar and Belshazzar with such persons, Daniel 2:2-11; Daniel 5:7, 8). Yet let one further effort be made. Let now the astrologers, the stargazers, the monthly prognosticators, stand up. These are scarcely three classes of persons, but rather the same class under three designations: \"astrologers\" (literally, \"dividers of the heavens\"); \"star-gazers,\" or observers of the stars; and \"monthly prognosticators,\" or almanack-makers. The astronomy of the Babylonians consisted primarily in \"dividing the heavens\" into \"houses,\" or constellations, and thus mapping them out in such a way that the infinite multiplicity, which at first baffles the beholder, might be grasped, reduced to order, and brought within the sphere of distinct cognizance. This work was an eminently useful one, and maintains its place in astronomy to the present day ('Ancient Monarchies,' vol. 2, p. 573). After the heavens were mapped out, and the courses of the sun and moon through the \"houses\" laid down, \"star-gazers\" directed their attention mainly to sun, moon, and planets, noting eclipses, occultations, conjunctions, and the like. All this was legitimate science; but, finally, the greater part of the astronomers launched into astrology, and undertook to prognosticate events from the changing phenomena of the heavens. Almanacks were put forth, in which predictions were made, either specially for a particular year, or generally for all time, based upon astronomical considerations; and on these great dependence was placed. (For a specimen of such an almanack, see 'Records of the Past,' vol. 1. pp. 158-161.)NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah47:14VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBehold, they shall be as stubble; the fire shall burn them; they shall not deliver themselves from the power of the flame: there shall not be a coal to warm at, nor fire to sit before it.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 14. - Behold, they shall be as stubble (comp. Isaiah 5:24; Isaiah 40:24; Isaiah 41:2). A favourite metaphor with Isaiah for extreme weakness and incapacity of resistance. In Isaiah 5:24 it is connected, as here, with fire. No doubt in Palestine, as elsewhere, an accidental fire from time to time caught hold of a stubble-field, and speedily reduced it to a mass of blackened ashes. The threat here is that God's wrath shall similarly sweep over Babylon. They shall not deliver themselves from the power of the flame. Mr. Cheyne translates, with much spirit, \"They cannot rescue their soul from the clutch of the flame.\" Like those who are caught in the midst of a fire in a prairie or jungle, they have no escape - the flame is on all sides - and they cannot but perish. There shall not be a coal to warm at; rather, it is not a charcoal-fire to warm one's self at. A return to the sarcastic tone of vers. 12, 13. The conflagration which spreads around is something more than a fire to warm one's self at - it is an awful widespread devastation.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah47:15VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThus shall they be unto thee with whom thou hast laboured, even thy merchants, from thy youth: they shall wander every one to his quarter; none shall save thee.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 15. - Thus shall they be unto thee with whom thou hast laboured. The foreigners who have participated in the toils and labours of Babylon shall share in her punishment. The flame of judgment shall not spare even them. Even thy merchants. Babylonian commerce is the subject of an important chapter in Heeren's 'Asiatic Nations' (vol. 2, pp. 190-260), and is discussed also in the present writer's 'Egypt and Babylon' (ch. 8, pp. 127-144). It was carried on both by land and sea, and was very extensive, including both a large import and a large export trade. Her merchants were, in part natives, in part foreigners. It is the latter who are here specially intended. Seeing the gradual closing in upon Babylon of the Persian armies, and anticipating the worst, they fly in haste from the doomed city, each one making for his own country, and having no thought of interposing to save the people which have so long encouraged and protected them. Probably the greater number of these foreign merchants were either Phoenicians or Arabians. They shall wander every one to his quarter. Not his own quarter of the town, but his own quarter of the earth; i.e. his own country (comp. Isaiah 13:14, \"They shall every man turn to his own people, and flee every one into his own land.\").NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINE","Isa.48":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah48:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHear ye this, O house of Jacob, which are called by the name of Israel, and are come forth out of the waters of Judah, which swear by the name of the LORD, and make mention of the God of Israel, but not in truth, nor in righteousness.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 1. - Jacob... Israel (camp. Isaiah 40:27; Isaiah 41:8, 14; Isaiah 43:1, 22; Isaiah 44:1, etc.). \"Jacob\" is the natural and secular designation; \"Israel\" is a spiritual or covenant name (Cheyne). Both terms being appropriate to the ten tribes no less than to the two, and the present address being intended especially for the Jewish captives, a further designation is appended - which are come forth out of the waters of Judah (comp. Psalm 68:26, \"Ye that are of the fountain of Israel,\" marginal rendering). Which swear by the Name of the Lord. Swearing \"by the Name of the Lord\" is an evidence of true religion, to a certain extent (Deuteronomy 6:13; Deuteronomy 10:20). It indicates that there has been, at any rate, no open apostasy. Still, it does not necessarily prove more than this; and, in the present case, it scarcely showed anything beyond mere outward formal conformity. The bulk of the captives \"swore by the Name of Jehovah, and made mention of the God of Israel\" (camp. Joshua 23:7), but did so not in truth, nor in righteousness; i.e. \"without their state of mind or mode of action corresponding to their confession, so as to prove that it was sincerely and seriously meant\" (Delitzsch). The condition of the majority of the exiles was that expressed in the words, \"This people honoureth me with their lips, but in their hearts are far from me\" (Matthew 15:8).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah48:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor they call themselves of the holy city, and stay themselves upon the God of Israel; The LORD of hosts is his name.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 2. - For they call themselves of the holy city. It is an indication of their real want of truth and righteousness, that they lay such stress upon what is so entirely outward and formal, as the fact of their belonging to\" the holy city,\" Jerusalem. Compare the boast of the Jews in our Lord's time, \"We be Abraham's seed\" (John 8:33). Stay themselves upon the God of Israel. Not resting upon him in real faith and true humble dependence, as those Israelites who are mentioned in Isaiah 10:20. but trusting to the facts that they were \"Israel,\" and that God was \"the God of Israel,\" and therefore bound to protect them. God reminds them that, if he is \"the God of Israel,\" he is also \"the Lord of hosts\" - a term, as Dr. Kay notes, especially connected with the holiness of God.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah48:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTI have declared the former things from the beginning; and they went forth out of my mouth, and I shewed them; I did them suddenly, and they came to pass.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 3. - I have declared the former things from the beginning (comp. Isaiah 41:26; Isaiah 43:9, 10; Isaiah 44:7, 8, etc.). \"Former things\" are here contrasted with the \"new things\" of ver. 6. Two cycles of prophecy seem to be intended - one of comparatively ancient date, the other quite fresh - both equally showing forth the power of God and his infinite superiority to the idols. It is difficult to determine what the two cycles of prophecy are. Delitzsch suggests that \"the former things are the events experienced by the people from the very earliest times down to the times of Cyrus,\" while \"the new things embrace the redemption of Israel from Babylon, the glorification of the people in the midst of a world of nations converted to the God of Israel, and the creation of a new heaven and a new earth.\" Dr. Kay thinks that the \"former things\" are those mentioned in the prophecies concerning Babylon generally, the \"new things those about to be announced in Isaiah 49-56. I did them suddenly; rather, suddenly I wrought.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah48:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBecause I knew that thou art obstinate, and thy neck is an iron sinew, and thy brow brass;VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 4. - I knew that thou art obstinate; literally, hard, or stiff - the adjective used in the phrase translated in our version \"stiff-necked.\" The idea is still more forcibly expressed in the following clause - thy neck is an iron sinew; or rather, a band of iron, as stiff as if it were made-of the hardest metal. And thy brow brass. The exact simile here used does not occur elsewhere in Scripture. It seems to be the origin of our expressions, \"brazen,... brazen-faced,\" \"to brazen a thing out.\" The forehead may be hardened for a good or for a bad purpose; in obstinacy or in a determination to resist evil (comp. Isaiah 1:7 and Ezekiel 3:8 with Jeremiah 5:3; Ezekiel 3:7; Zechariah 7:12). Here the hardening is evil, marking defiance and self-will.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah48:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTI have even from the beginning declared it to thee; before it came to pass I shewed it thee: lest thou shouldest say, Mine idol hath done them, and my graven image, and my molten image, hath commanded them.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 5. - I have even from the beginning declared it (comp. ver. 3). The declaration here made is that God rendered his prophecies more than ordinarily marvellous on account of Israel's obstinacy, not punishing them for it, lint seeking graciously and lovingly to overcome it by adding to the weight of the evidence to which he would fain have had it yield. Had his prophecies been less astonishing, had they in a less degree transcended ordinary human experience, Israel might conceivably have ascribed them and the accomplishment of them to the false gods. As it was, this was barely possible. Mine idol... my molten image. It has been already observed (see the comment on Isaiah 40:18) that there was a strong tendency to idolatry among the Jews, not only before, but during the Captivity. Ezekiel says that those among whom he lived were \"polluted after the manner of their fathers, and committed whoredom after their abominations; made their sons pass through the fire, and polluted themselves with all their idols\" (Ezekiel 20:30, 31); nay, went so far as to declare boldly, \"We will be as the heathen, as the inhabitants of the countries, to serve wood and stone\" (Ezekiel 20:32). The \"prevailing tendency,\" as Delitzsch remarks, was \"to combine the worship of Jehovah with heathenism, or else to exchange the former altogether for the latter.\" We cannot conclude anything concerning the mass of the community from the character of those who returned. Those who returned were the sincere worshippers of Jehovah - the irreligious did not care to return. It is always to be borne in mind that it was \"the great mass even of Judah,\" no less than of Israel, that \"remained behind\" (Delitzsch); and these \"became absorbed into the heathen, to whom they became more and more assimilated\" (ibid.). Hath commanded them; i.e. \"hath caused them (the events) to take place\" (comp. Psalm 33:9).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah48:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThou hast heard, see all this; and will not ye declare it? I have shewed thee new things from this time, even hidden things, and thou didst not know them.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 6. - Thou hast heard, see all this; rather, thou didst hear, (now) see it all, i.e. see all the prophecies now fulfilled, which thou heardest in days gone by. Will ye not declare it? Will ye not for very shame make known generally the accordance between the prophecies and the events, which you cannot fail to see? Will ye not become \"my witnesses\" (Isaiah 43:10), and turn away from your idols? I have showed thee; rather, I show thee; i.e. \"I am about to show thee from this time new things, even hidden things, which thou knowest not\" - things belonging to the new cycle of prophecy, not previously announced, but reserved for the present crisis (see the comment on ver. 3). On the whole, the language used seems most consonant with the view of Dr. Kay, that the \"new things\" are those about to be revealed in the next section of the prophecy (Isaiah 49-53), things belonging to the coming of Christ, and the \"new creation\" which it will be the great object of his coming to bring about.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah48:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThey are created now, and not from the beginning; even before the day when thou heardest them not; lest thou shouldest say, Behold, I knew them.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 7. - They are created now. The revelation to man of what has lain secret in God's counsels from all eternity is a sort of creation. As Nagelbach well says, it converts the λόγος ἐνδιάθετος into a λόγος προφορικός and therefore is one step towards actual accomplishment. The mystery of \"the Servant of the Lord,\" and of atonement and salvation through him, had hitherto been hid away - \"hid in God\" (Ephesians 3:9), and was now for the first time to be made known to such as had \"eyes to see\" and \"cars to hear\" by the teaching of the evangelical prophet. Even before the day when thou heardest them not; rather, and before to-day thou heardest them not. Whatever shadows of evangelic truth are discernible in the Law and in the earlier psalms, they did not constitute a revelation of the way of salvation at all comparable to that contained in Isaiah's later chapters. Lest thou shouldest say, Behold, I knew them. If the \"new things\" of Isaiah's prophecy had been revealed many centuries before, they would not have impressed the Jews of Isaiah's time, or even of the Captivity period, as they did by having been reserved to a comparatively late date. They would have seemed to most of them an old and trite story.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah48:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTYea, thou heardest not; yea, thou knewest not; yea, from that time that thine ear was not opened: for I knew that thou wouldest deal very treacherously, and wast called a transgressor from the womb.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 8. - Thou heardest not... thou knewest not. Again we seem to hear the voice of complaint, as in vers. 1, 2, 4. Israel had not \"ears to hear\" to any purpose such highly spiritual truths as those of the coming section. They had not profited by what was taught concerning Christ in the Law and the Psalms. From that time that thine ear was not opened; rather, from that time thine ear hath not been open. \"From that time\" means \"from of old,\" or \"from the beginning.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah48:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor my name's sake will I defer mine anger, and for my praise will I refrain for thee, that I cut thee not off.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 9. - For my Name's sake will I defer mine anger. Israel's insincerity (ver. 1), obstinacy (ver. 4), addiction to idols (ver. 5), blindness (ver. 8), and general resistance to God's will (ver. 8), could not but have provoked God's \"anger.\" He will, however, \"defer\" it, \"refrain\" himself, not \"cut Israel off, for his Name's sake.\" God, having selected one nation out of all the nations of the earth to be his \"peculiar people\" (Deuteronomy 14:2), and having declared this, and supported his people by miracles in their struggles with the other nations and peoples, was, so to speak, committed to protect and defend Israel \"for his Name's sake,\" lest his Name should be blasphemed among the Gentiles (see Exodus 32:12; Numbers 14:13; Deuteronomy 9:28; Psalm 129:10; 106:8, etc.). He was also bound by the promises which he had made; and. still more, by the position which Israel occupied in his scheme of salvation, to allow the nation still to exist, and therefore to condone its iniquities and restrain his anger. But the dregs of the cup of vengeance were poured out at last.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah48:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBehold, I have refined thee, but not with silver; I have chosen thee in the furnace of affliction.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 10. - I have refined thee, but not with silver; rather, but not as silver (Cheyne). or, but not in the manner of silver (Delitzsch); i.e. not with the severity with which silver is refined (see Psalm 12:6). I have chosen thee; rather, I have tested thee. The furnace of affliction is here the Babylonian captivity. The object of the Captivity was to \"test\" and \"refine,\" or purify God's people to a certain extent - not with extreme severity, but in such sort as to fit them to \"bear his Name before the Gentiles\" for another five hundred years.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah48:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor mine own sake, even for mine own sake, will I do it: for how should my name be polluted? and I will not give my glory unto another.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 11. - How should my Name be polluted? i.e. how should I allow of its pollution or desecration (see the comment on ver. 9)? I will not give my glory unto another (comp. Isaiah 42:8). God would have ceded his glory to some god of the nations, had he under existing circumstances forsaken Israel.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah48:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHearken unto me, O Jacob and Israel, my called; I am he; I am the first, I also am the last.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 12-15. - THE SECOND ADDRESS. The tone of complaint is now dropped. Israel is invited to reflect seriously on the chief points urged in the preceding chapters.NEWLINENEWLINE(1) Their near relation to Jehovah (ver. 12);NEWLINENEWLINE(2) Jehovah's eternity and omnipotence (vers. 12, 13);NEWLINENEWLINE(3) the superiority of Jehovah to the gods of the nations, as shown by his prophetic power (ver. 14); andNEWLINENEWLINE(4) the near approach of deliverance by Cyrus (vers. 14, 15). Verse 12. - O Jacob and Israel (comp. Isaiah 40:27; Isaiah 41:8, 14; Isaiah 43:1, 22; Isaiah 44:1, 21; Isaiah 46:3; Isaiah 48:1). The figure is used which rhetoricians call hendiadys. The two names designate one and the same object. My called. \"Called\" and \"chosen\" from of old, out of all the nations of the earth (comp. Isaiah 41:9; Isaiah 44:1, 2, etc.); therefore bound to \"hear\" and to attend. Still more bound, considering who it is by whom they have been called - I AM HE - i.e. \"I am the absolute and eternally unchangeable One, the Alpha and Omega of all history\" (Delitzsch). The first, and also the Last, \"from whom and to whom are all things\" (Romans 11:36).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah48:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTMine hand also hath laid the foundation of the earth, and my right hand hath spanned the heavens: when I call unto them, they stand up together.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 13. - Mine hand also hath laid the foundation of the earth (comp. Isaiah 40:12, 22, 26, 28; Isaiah 42:5; Isaiah 44:24; Isaiah 45:12, 18). As the Maker of heaven and earth, God is entitled to the attention and obedience of all the dwellers in heaven and earth. My right hand hath spanned the heavens; i.e. measured them, as with a span (Isaiah 41:12)-fixed their limits and dimensions. When I call unto them, they stand up together (comp. Isaiah 40:26). Heaven and earth, and all things that are in them, except man, are prompt to perform God's will, and rise up at once at his call to show their readiness. The metaphor is drawn from the conduct of intelligent agents.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah48:14VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAll ye, assemble yourselves, and hear; which among them hath declared these things? The LORD hath loved him: he will do his pleasure on Babylon, and his arm shall be on the Chaldeans.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 14. - All ye, assemble yourselves. \"Once more the nations are challenged to say which of their deities has foretold the work that the Lord has willed to perform on Babylon\" (Kay) (see above, Isaiah 43:9). If none has done so, will not Israel see and acknowledge the superiority of Jehovah to such blind deities? The Lord hath loved him. It had not been previously declared in so many words that Jehovah \"loved\" Cyrus; but it had been sufficiently indicated by the way in which he was spoken of in Isaiah 44:28 and Isaiah 45:1-5. God \"loves\" all who \"in an honest and good heart\" seek according to their lights to do his will and serve him faithfully. Nebuchadnezzar is called his \"servant\" (Isaiah 25:9; Isaiah 27:6; Ezekiel 29:18, 20), Cyrus (in Isaiah 45:1) his \"anointed.\" It is but going one step further to call the latter his \"loved one.\" He will do his pleasure; i.e. \"God's pleasure,\" not his own (see Isaiah 44:28). His arm shall be on the Chaldeans. The Hebrew is very harsh, and perhaps requires emendation; but the meaning can scarcely be other than that expressed in our version.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah48:15VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTI, even I, have spoken; yea, I have called him: I have brought him, and he shall make his way prosperous.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 15. - I have called him (comp. Isaiah 46:11, \"Calling a ravenous bird from the east\"). Cyrus is represented as raised up by God, \"called\" by him, and commissioned by him \"to do all his pleasure.\" God has brought him on his way, and made that way prosperous. According to the account of Herodotus, Cyrus received no check of any kind until the last expedition, in which he lost his life. His \"prosperity\" was beyond that of almost any other commander.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah48:16VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTCome ye near unto me, hear ye this; I have not spoken in secret from the beginning; from the time that it was, there am I: and now the Lord GOD, and his Spirit, hath sent me.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 16-22. - THE THIRD ADDRESS. Israel is reminded of God's merciful teaching and leading in the past (vers. 16, 17); expostulated with on their disobedience (vers. 18, 19); exhorted to go forth boldly and joyfully from Babylon (vers. 20, 21); and finally warned that God's blessings - even such a blessing as deliverance - are no blessings to any but the righteous (ver. 22). Verse 16. - I have not spoken in secret from the beginning. God, \"from the beginning,\" i.e. from his first dealings with Israel, had raised up a succession of prophets, who had declared his will, not \"in secret,\" or ambiguously, but openly and plainly, so that all who heard might understand (comp. Isaiah 45:19, and see the comment ad loc.). From the time that it was, there am I; i.e. \"from the time that the earth was, there (in the succession of my prophetic messengers) was I.\" It was I who spake by their mouth, and thus announced my will publicly. And now the Lord God, and his Spirit, hath sent me. Dr. Kay supposes that \"one Divine Personage is here sent by another\" - the Second Person of the Holy Trinity by the First and by the Third; but it is against the analogy of faith that the Third Person should send the Second. Probably Mr. Cheyne is right in suggesting that \"here a fresh speaker is introduced,\" and also right in his supposition that the fresh speaker is \"the prophet himself,\" who tells us that he is now carrying on the goodly succession which has been \"from the beginning,\" and is sent to deliver his message by God (the Father) and his (Holy) Spirit. On the tendency of Isaiah to \"hypostatize\" the Spirit of God, see the comment on Isaiah 40:13; and compare Mr. Cheyne's note on the same passage ('Prophecies of Isaiah,' vol. 1. p. 243).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah48:17VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThus saith the LORD, thy Redeemer, the Holy One of Israel; I am the LORD thy God which teacheth thee to profit, which leadeth thee by the way that thou shouldest go.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 17. - The Lord... which teacheth thee to profit. God's teachings are all directed to the \"profit\" of those to whom they are addressed; and, if received in a proper spirit, actually \"profit\" them more than anything else can do. \"All Scripture is given by inspiration of God, and is profitable\" (2 Timothy 3:16). Very profitable also are the teachings of God's providence, which chasten men, warn men, and tend to keep men in the right path.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah48:18VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTO that thou hadst hearkened to my commandments! then had thy peace been as a river, and thy righteousness as the waves of the sea:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 18. - Oh that thou hadst hearkened! (comp. Psalm 81:13-16, \"Oh that my people had hearkened unto me, and Israel had walked in my ways! I should soon have subdued their enemies, and turned my hand against their adversaries,\" etc.) Some render, \"Oh that thou wouldst hearken!\" etc., on the analogy of Isaiah 64:1; but unnecessarily. Dr. Kay says that God \"upbraideth not,\" referring to James 1:5. But he may expostulate. What is it but expostulation, when our Lord says, \"O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, thou that killest the prophets, and stonest them which are sent unto thee, how often would I have gathered thy children together, even as a hen gathereth her chickens under her wings, and ye would not! Behold, your house is left unto you desolate\" (Matthew 23:27, 28)? To look back on the past, and see what we have missed, is a good lesson for the future. Then had thy peace been as a river; literally, as the river (i.e. the Euphrates), abounding, overflowing, continuous. Thy righteousness. Not \"thy prosperity\" (Cheyne), but \"thy good deeds.\" If Israel had clung to God, then God's blessing would have been poured upon them, and have enabled them to bring forth abundant fruits of righteousness. As the waves of the sea; i.e. innumerable and unceasing.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah48:19VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThy seed also had been as the sand, and the offspring of thy bowels like the gravel thereof; his name should not have been cut off nor destroyed from before me.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 19. - Thy seed also had been as the sand. Israel, at the close of the Captivity, was \"a remnant\" (Isaiah 37:31), a \"very small remnant\" (Isaiah 1:9); the ten tribes were for the most part absorbed into the heathen among whom they had been scattered; the two tribes had dwindled in number through the hardships of the Captivity, and were scarcely more than a \"handful.\" Less than fifty thousand returned with Zerubbabel (Ezra 2:64); less than two thousand males with Ezra (Ezra 8:2-20). Had Israel not been disobedient, the promises made to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob would have been literally fulfilled, and the descendants of Abraham would have been millions upon millions, instead of being one or two hundred thousand. The offspring of thy bowels like the gravel thereof; rather, like the grains thereof; i.e. the grains of the sand. His name; i.e. \"Israel's name.\" Should not have been cut off. Israel's name had not been wholly \"cut off\" or \"destroyed.\" But it had been approximately \"cut off.\" Israel was no more a people, but only a horde of slaves. The restoration to Palestine was a resurrection - the re-creation of a nation which, humanly speaking, had ceased to be.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah48:20VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTGo ye forth of Babylon, flee ye from the Chaldeans, with a voice of singing declare ye, tell this, utter it even to the end of the earth; say ye, The LORD hath redeemed his servant Jacob.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 20. - Go ye forth of Babylon. A sudden transition from expostulation to exhortation. It might have seemed that no exhortation would be needed; that, as soon as the prison-doors were set open, there would be a general rush to escape. But, when the time came, it was not so. Those only availed themselves of the edict of Cyrus \"whose spirit God had raised to go up and build his house\" (Ezra 1:5). The wealthier classes, Josephus tells us ('Ant. Jud.,' 11:1), remained. The very poor, it is probable, could not leave. Motives of various kinds detained others. The result was that probably a larger number elected to continue in the country than to return to Palestine. Hence the exhortation to \"go forth from Babylon and flee from the Chaldeans\" was far from being superfluous. Flee ye from the Chaldeans. Not \"flee before them\" (see Isaiah 52:12), as enemies to be feared; but quit them hastily, as corrupters to be avoided. With a voice of singing; rather, with a voice of shouting (Delitzsch), or with a ridging cry (Cheyne). The cry was to reach even to the end of the earth. All the nations were to be informed of the great event, in which they might not feel, but in which they were, deeply interested - the deliverance of Israel out of Babylon, which was \"the prelude of, and a preparation for, the world's redemption\" (Kay).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah48:21VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd they thirsted not when he led them through the deserts: he caused the waters to flow out of the rock for them: he clave the rock also, and the waters gushed out.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 21. - They thirsted not (comp. Isaiah 43:19, and the comment ad loc). The literal meaning is not to be altogether excluded. We have no historical account of the journey made by the bulk of the exiles who returned with Zerubbabel; but they must almost certainly have experienced difficulties with respect to water; and it is quite possible that a miraculous supply was vouchsafed to them. Most commentators, however, are content to explain both this and the earlier passage as merely \"symbolical.\" The Israelites - they say - had spiritual refreshment on their homeward journey, by God's goodness, constantly.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah48:22VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThere is no peace, saith the LORD, unto the wicked.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 22. - There is no peace, etc. This warning phrase occurs again, \"in the manner of a refrain\" (Cheyne), at the close of what most commentators regard as the second section of this portion of Isaiah's work (Isaiah 57:21). The third section closes with a still more solemn warning (Isaiah 66:24).NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINE","Isa.49":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah49:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTListen, O isles, unto me; and hearken, ye people, from far; The LORD hath called me from the womb; from the bowels of my mother hath he made mention of my name.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 1-12. - JEHOVAH'S ATTESTATION OF HIS SERVANT'S MISSION. Jehovah called his Servant from the womb; mentioned him by name; made his mouth a sharp sword; held him in his hand; caused him to be a polished weapon; appointed him his Servant; assured him of a right and a recompense; appointed him, not only to restore and recover Israel, but to be a Light to the Gentiles, and to give salvation to the ends of the world (vers. 1-6); chose him (ver. 7); will help him (ver. 8); through him will both deliver the captive everywhere (ver. 9), and cause joy to break out in every part of heaven and earth (vers. 11-13). It is quite impossible that these things can be said of aught but a person, or of any person other than him in whom all the nations of the earth were to be blessed (Genesis 22:18). Verse 1. - Listen, O isles (comp. Isaiah 41:1; Isaiah 42:1, 4, 6). Since the beginning of ch. 43. Israel alone has been addressed. Now that the mission of the Servant of Jehovah is to be treated of, all the world must be summoned to hear, for all the world is directly interested. Ye people; rather, ye peoples, or ye nations. The Lord hath called me from the womb. Isaiah could not have said this of himself, for his \"call\" took place when he was of mature age. But Christ was designated for his office from the womb (Luke 1:31-33). He was also still \"in the womb of his mother\" when the name of Jesus was given to him (Matthew 1:21, Luke 1:31).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah49:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he hath made my mouth like a sharp sword; in the shadow of his hand hath he hid me, and made me a polished shaft; in his quiver hath he hid me;VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 2. - He hath made my mouth like a sharp sword. The author of the Epistle to the Hebrews says that \"the Word of God\" generally \"is... sharper than any two-edged sword, piercing even to the dividing asunder of soul and spirit, and of the joints and marrow\" (Hebrews 4:12). Christian experience testifies that tiffs keen, searching, cutting power attaches in an especial way to the sayings of Jesus, which pierce the heart as no other words can do, and rankle in the soul, which is quite unable to forget them. The imagery recurs in the Revelation of St. John (John 1:16; John 2:12, 16; John 19:15, 21). In the shadow of his hand hath he hid me. Either keeping him safe from the malice of his enemies, or reserving him until, \"in the fulness of time,\" it would be fitting to reveal him to the world. And made me a polished shaft, A weapon even keener than a sword, smoothed and polished, so as to make it pierce the deeper, and kept hid in God's quiver until the time came when it could be launched with most effect against the hearts of ungodly men.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah49:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd said unto me, Thou art my servant, O Israel, in whom I will be glorified.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 3. - Thou art my Servant, O Israel. That the literal \"Israel,\" is not intended appears plainly from ver. 5. The Servant himself is addressed as \"Israel,\" because he \"would stand as a new federal head to the nation\" (Kay), which would be summed up in him, and also because he would be, in a truer sense than any other, an \"Israel,\" or \"Prince with God.\" In whom I will be glorified (comp. John 13:31, \"Now is the Son of man glorified, and God is glorified in him\"). He who is \"the Brightness of the Father's glory\" sets forth that glory before men, and causes them to glorify him, both with their tongues and in their lives.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah49:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen I said, I have laboured in vain, I have spent my strength for nought, and in vain: yet surely my judgment is with the LORD, and my work with my God.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 4. - Then I said, I have laboured in vain; rather, and I, for my part, had said. The Servant had momentarily desponded, seeing the small results of all his efforts to reclaim Israel, and had felt a natural human regret at so much labour apparently expended in vain; but his despondency had been soon checked by the thought that God would not suffer any \"labour of love\" to be wholly in vain, but would give it the recompense which it merited. The verse brings strongly out the true humanity of the \"Servant,\" who feels as men naturally feel, but restrains himself, and does not allow his feelings to carry him away. Compare with this despondency the grief exhibited by our Lord on two occasions (Matthew 23:37; John 11:35), and the depression which extorted from him the memorable words, \"Eli, Eli, lama sabachthani?\" (Matthew 27:46). My work; rather, my reward, or my recompense.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah49:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd now, saith the LORD that formed me from the womb to be his servant, to bring Jacob again to him, Though Israel be not gathered, yet shall I be glorious in the eyes of the LORD, and my God shall be my strength.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 5. - And now, saith the Lord, etc.; rather, and now the Lord hath said - he that formed me from the womb to be a Servant to him, that I might bring back Jacob to him, and that Israel might be gathered to him; for I shall be glorious in the eyes of the Lord, and my God is become my Strength - he hath said - It is a light thing, etc. The whole of ver. 5, after the words, \"and now the Lord hath said,\" is parenthetic. (On the service which our Lord continually rendered, while on earth, to the Father, see Luke 2:49; Luke 4:43; John 4:34; John 6:38; John 17:4.) The Revelation of St. John shows that in heaven he is still engaged in carrying out his Father's behests. Though Israel be not gathered. This reading, as Mr. Cheyne remarks, \"entirely spoils the symmetry of the verse.\" The practice of writing fresh copies of the Scripture from dictation is answerable for the double reading of לֹא and לו both here and in other places. Yet shall I be glorious. The \"Servant\" would receive glory even by such a partial conversion of the Jews as took place through his ministry. It is never to be forgotten that all the original twelve apostles were Jews, that Matthias was a Jew, that Paul and Barnabas were Jews, and that the original Church was a Church of Jews (Acts 2:41-47). All that was truly spiritual in Judaism flowed into the Church of Christ, as into its natural home, and the Jewish element in the Church, if not numerically great, was yet the predominant and formative element.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah49:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he said, It is a light thing that thou shouldest be my servant to raise up the tribes of Jacob, and to restore the preserved of Israel: I will also give thee for a light to the Gentiles, that thou mayest be my salvation unto the end of the earth.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 6. - It is a light thing. God rewards his servants according to their works. He is supremely just. He was not content that even Nebuchadnezzar should be insufficiently rewarded for the service that he rendered against Tyre (Ezekiel 29:18), and he therefore gave him Egypt in addition as his recompense (Ezekiel 29:20). It would have been \"a light thing\" - \"too light a thing\" (Kay, Cheyne) - to have rewarded the labours of Jesus with the conversion of the Jews only. God therefore gave him as his recompense the gathering in of the Gentiles also, and made him a means of salvation even to the uttermost ends of the earth. The preserved of Israel; i.e. the \"remnant\" that had not perished through previous judgments. I will also give thee for a Light to the Gentiles (comp. Isaiah 11:10; Isaiah 34:1; Isaiah 42:6; Isaiah 55:5, etc.). Greeks Ἕλληνες were brought into contact with our Lord himself shortly before his crucifixion (John 12:20). He wrought a miracle for a Syro-Phoenician woman (Mark 7:25-30). His apostles, after a little time, understood that the gospel was for the world at large, and declared that in Christ there was no difference between Jew and Greek, nay! between Jew and barbarian. Christ had died for all - had come to be a Light to all, would have all come into his Church and obtain salvation through union with him. That thou mayest be my Salvation. Christ is called \"Salvation,\" as the Bearer of salvation - he through whom alone can any man be saved (Acts 4:12). So he is called \"Peace\" (Micah 5:5), as the Giver of peace.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah49:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThus saith the LORD, the Redeemer of Israel, and his Holy One, to him whom man despiseth, to him whom the nation abhorreth, to a servant of rulers, Kings shall see and arise, princes also shall worship, because of the LORD that is faithful, and the Holy One of Israel, and he shall choose thee.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 7. - His Holy One; i.e. \"the Holy One of Israel.\" To him whom man despiseth; literally, who is despised of souls. This is the first place in the prophecies of Isaiah where this note of the Messiah is brought forward. It is found earlier in the Psalms, as especially in Psalm 22:6, et seq., \"I am a worm, and no man; a reproach of men, and despised of the people;\" and later on it is expanded into a chapter (ch. 53.). Whom the nation abhorreth; rather, whom mankind abhorreth. The term used is goi, which points to the Gentiles rather than to the Jews. Mankind at large dislikes a \"Holy One,\" since he is a perpetual reproach to it (see Isaiah 30:11; and comp. Plut., 'Republ.,' 7:2, ad fin.). It is not the Jews only who exclaim in such a case, \"Away with him! away with him!\" (John 19:15). There is such an antagonism between sin and holiness, that the ungodly everywhere and in all ages detest the godly and virtuous. A servant of rulers; or, a slave of despots; treated as a slave, i.e. by such irresponsible rulers as Herod (Luke 23:11) and Pontius Pilate (John 19:1, 16). The \"King of kings\" bowed himself to a slave's death. Kings shall see and arise, princes also shall worship (comp. Psalm 72:10, 11; Isaiah 52:15; Isaiah 50:3, 10, 11, etc.). According to a tradition - which, however, cannot be traced back to any very ancient source - the Magi who came to worship our Lord at Bethlehem were \"kings.\" The prophecy is, however, to be regarded as having its main fulfilment in the coming to Christ of so many kings and princes, since his ascension into heaven (comp ver. 23). And the Holy One of Israel, and he shall choose thee; rather, the Holy One of Israel, that hath chosen thee. Kings will rise from their thrones, and prostrate themselves before Messiah, convinced that Jehovah is faithful in the performance of his promises, and has chosen the Son of Mary to be the Redeemer so long announced as about to appear on earth.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah49:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThus saith the LORD, In an acceptable time have I heard thee, and in a day of salvation have I helped thee: and I will preserve thee, and give thee for a covenant of the people, to establish the earth, to cause to inherit the desolate heritages;VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 8. - In an acceptable time; literally, in a time of good pleasure; i.e. the time fixed by my good pleasure from the creation of the world. Heard thee... helped thee. The Father \"heard\" and \"helped\" the only begotten Son through the whole period of his earthly ministry (Luke 2:40, 52; John 3:2; John 8:28; John 12:28; John 14:10, etc.). I will give thee for a Covenant of the people (comp. Isaiah 42:6, and the comment, ad loc.). To establish the earth; rather, as in ver. 6, to raise up the earth, to lift it out of its existing condition of meanness and degradation. To cause to inherit the desolate heritages; i.e. to cause the desolate heritages of the earth - the places devoid of trite religion - to be possessed, and as it were \"inherited,\" by those who would introduce into them the true knowledge of God. As Israel inherited Canaan (Deuteronomy 3:28; Joshua 1:6), so would Christian nations inherit many \"desolate heritages,\" where ignorance and sin prevailed, with the result that light would penetrate into the dark regions, and, ultimately, all flesh see the salvation of God.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah49:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThat thou mayest say to the prisoners, Go forth; to them that are in darkness, Shew yourselves. They shall feed in the ways, and their pastures shall be in all high places.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 9. - That thou mayest say to the prisoners, Go forth, \"The prisoners\" here are not the captives in Babylon, but the servants of sin throughout the world. Christ would say to them, \"Go forth.\" He would summon them by his messengers to repent and be converted, and quit the service of sin, and \"go forths\" from the kingdom of darkness, and \"show themselves\" as lights of the world (Matthew 5:14; Philippians 2:15), walking \"as children of the light\" (Ephesians 5:8). It is a narrow exegesis which confines the prophet's forecast to the mere return of the exiles to Palestine, and their re-settlement on their ancestral estates. They shall feed in the ways, etc. The returning \"prisoners\" are now represented as a flock of sheep (comp. Isaiah 40:11), whom the good Shepherd will \"lead\" and \"guide\" by ways in which they will find sufficient pasture, which shall not fail them even when they pass over bare \"hill-tops\" (see John 10:11-16; John 21:15-17).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah49:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThey shall not hunger nor thirst; neither shall the heat nor sun smite them: for he that hath mercy on them shall lead them, even by the springs of water shall he guide them.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 10. - They shall not hunger nor thirst (cf. John 4:14; John 6:35). God's grace is sufficient for his faithful ones. They are content with the sustenance which he awards them, and neither \"hunger\" nor \"thirst.\" Neither shall the heat nor sun smite them; rather, neither shall the glowing sand nor the sun smite them (see Isaiah 35:7). To those who walk at noonday over the \"glowing sand\" of the desert, the heat which \"smites them\" seems to come as much from below as from above, the white ground reflecting the sun's rays with a force almost equal to that wherewith the rays themselves beat down upon them from the sky. The Lord's faithful ones, in their passage through the wilderness of life, shall be free Item these fearful trials. \"The sun shall not smite them by day, neither the moon by night\" (Psalm 121:6) He that hath mercy on them; or, that hath compassion on them - that sympathizes with their sufferings, and pities them in their trials (comp. vers. 13 and 15). Shall lead them (comp. Psalm 23:2; Isaiah 40:11). The Oriental shepherd for the most part goes before his flock.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah49:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd I will make all my mountains a way, and my highways shall be exalted.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 11. - I will make all my mountains a way.

Mountains shall he as roads, and as highways lifted up.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah49:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBehold, these shall come from far: and, lo, these from the north and from the west; and these from the land of Sinim.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 12. - These shall come from far. The nations shall flow in from all sides to the Redeemer's kingdom (Isaiah 2:2; Isaiah 11:10; Isaiah 60:1-5, etc.). They shall come from the north and from the west; literally, from the north and from the sea, which generally means \"the west,\" but which, in one enumeration of the points of the compass (Psalm 107:3), is certainly \"the south.\" They shall also come from the land of Sinim by which most recent interpreters understand China. But it is highly improbable that an ethnic name which was not known to the Greeks till the time of Ptolemy (A.D. 120) should have recoiled Palestine by B.C. 700. And if \"the sea\" means \"the south\" in the preceding clause, the Sinim may be these of Phoenicia (Genesis 10:17), who were among the furthest inhabitants of Asia towards the west. In any case, the reference is, not to the dispersed Jews, but to the remote Gentiles, who would pass from all quarters lute the kingdom of the Redeemer.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah49:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTSing, O heavens; and be joyful, O earth; and break forth into singing, O mountains: for the LORD hath comforted his people, and will have mercy upon his afflicted.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 13-26. - ZION COMFORTED IN HER DESPONDENCY. While the future is thus glorious, both for the \"Servant of the Lord\" and for his people Israel, the present is gloom and misery. Zion - not here the city, but the people of God - desponds and says, \"Jehovah has forsaken me, and my Lord hath forgotten me\" (ver. 14). This burst of grief, though arising from weakness of faith, is forgiven by the compassion of God, and \"afflicted\" Israel is \"comforted\" and consoled through the remainder of the chapter (vers. 15-26). Verse 13. - Sing, O heavens (comp. Isaiah 44:23). Heaven and earth are called upon to rejoice and \"break forth into singing\"NEWLINENEWLINE(1) because of the glory that awaits the Redeemer (vers. 5-12); andNEWLINENEWLINE(3) because of the gracious intentions of God with respect to Israel (vers. 16-26). O mountains The majesty of mountains seems to have deeply impressed Isaiah. Throughout his writings they are continually introduced as the grandest of the works of God (comp. Isaiah 2:2, 14; Isaiah 5:25; Isaiah 13:4; Isaiah 14:25; Isaiah 22:5; Isaiah 30:25; Isaiah 34:3; Isaiah 37:24; Isaiah 40:4, 9, 12; Isaiah 41:15; Isaiah 42:11, 15, etc.). He expects them to be especially ready to sympathize with man. Such a feeling would be natural to one accustomed to the hill-country of Palestine and the lofty heights of Hermon and Lebanon, but could scarcely have been developed in an exile of the time of Cyrus, born and brought up in the dead level of Babylonia. Hath comforted... will have mercy. Both verbs designate the same action, which is really future, but in God's counsels is already accomplished. The perfect is thus, once more, that of prophetic certitude.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah49:14VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut Zion said, The LORD hath forsaken me, and my Lord hath forgotten me.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 14. - But Zion said. \"Zion\" is here the \"daughter of Zion,\" or the people of Israel, as in Isaiah 51:16. The meaning is a rare one. The Lord hath forsaken me (comp. Isaiah 40:27). It is not surprising that Israel - even faithful Israel - sometimes desponded, or perhaps despaired, during the long and weary time of the Captivity. Even the \"Servant of the Lord\" knew moments of despondency (see above, ver. 4, with the comment).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah49:15VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTCan a woman forget her sucking child, that she should not have compassion on the son of her womb? yea, they may forget, yet will I not forget thee.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 15. - Can a woman forget?.... yea, they may forget. In the siege of Samaria by Benhadad, King of Syria, a mother, we are told (2 Kings 6:28, 29), boiled her son for food. In the last siege of Jerusalem similar horrors are reported (Joseph., 'Bell. Jud.,' 6:03, 4). Mothers have even been known in England who have forced their tender and innocent daughters to commit deadly sin. Yet will I not forget, The love of God surpasses that of either father or mother. \"When my father and my mother forsake me,\" says David, \"then the Lord will take me up\" (Psalm 27:10). \"God is love\" (1 John 4:8) in his very essence; and his infinite love is deeper, tenderer, truer, than finite love can ever be. Still, that which is nearest to it upon earth is, doubtless, the love of a mother for her children (see Isaiah 66:13).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah49:16VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBehold, I have graven thee upon the palms of my hands; thy walls are continually before me.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 16. - Behold, I have graven thee upon the palms of my hands. The prophet has passed here from the living Zion, Isabel, to their material home, Jerusalem. The metaphor which he uses is no doubt drawn from the practice, common both in ancient and in modern days, of burning or puncturing figures and other mementos upon the hand, the arm, or some other part of the body, and then rendering the figures indelible by rubbing in henna, indigo, gunpowder, or some other coloured substance. Pilgrims in the East have almost always such marks put upon them when they have accomplished their pilgrimage. English sailors are fond of them, and few are without some such mark on their breast or limbs. The meaning here is that God has the thought of Zion as constantly present with him as if her image were indelibly marked on the palms of his hands. (On the anthropomorphic representation of God as having \"arms\" and \"hands,\" see the comment on Isaiah 40:10.) Thy walls. It is the city, Zion, the emblem of the people, that can alone be \"graven\" or \"portrayed.\" This city has, of course, walls. God bears them in mind perpetually, since he is about to cause them to be built up (Nehemiah 3, 4.).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah49:17VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThy children shall make haste; thy destroyers and they that made thee waste shall go forth of thee.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 17. - Thy children shall make haste; i.e. \"thy exiled children shall hasten, when the appointed time comes, to return to Zion, and rebuild its temple and towers and walls.\" At the same time, thy destroyers and they that have made thee waste, who are regarded as still carrying on their devastations, shall leave thee and go forth of thee.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah49:18VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTLift up thine eyes round about, and behold: all these gather themselves together, and come to thee. As I live, saith the LORD, thou shalt surely clothe thee with them all, as with an ornament, and bind them on thee, as a bride doeth.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 18. - Lift up thine eyes round about and behold (comp. Isaiah 50:4, where the same phrase occurs in connection with the conversion of the Gentiles). All these gather themselves together (comp. ver. 12). Thou shalt surely clothe thee with them all, as with an ornament (comp. Zechariah 9:16). The restored Church, receiving adhesions from the nations on all sides, will be like a bride who puts on her ornaments, and is thereby made glorious to look upon (Isaiah 61:10, ad fin.). The entire Church, not any one part, is designated as the \"Bride\" of Christ in the New Testament (2 Corinthians 11:2; Ephesians 5:29, 32; Revelation 21:2, 9; Revelation 22:17).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah49:19VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor thy waste and thy desolate places, and the land of thy destruction, shall even now be too narrow by reason of the inhabitants, and they that swallowed thee up shall be far away.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 19. - The land of thy destruction; or, of thy overthrow - i.e, where thou wert overthrown by Nebuchadnezzar - shall even now be too narrow, etc. This must not be understood literally. Palestine, after the return from the Captivity, was at no time over-populated; and when the conversion of the Gentiles took place it caused no influx of fresh settlers into the Holy Land. The object of the prophet is simply to mark the vast growth of the Church, which would necessarily spread itself far beyond the limits of Palestine, and would ultimately require the whole earth for its habitation.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah49:20VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe children which thou shalt have, after thou hast lost the other, shall say again in thine ears, The place is too strait for me: give place to me that I may dwell.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 20. - The children which thou shalt have, after thou hast lost the other; literally, the children of thy bereavement; i.e. the Gentiles who shall replace those many faithless Israelites who refused to return when Cyrus issued his edict, and became lost to the Church of God. The place is too strait for me (see the comment on ver. 19).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah49:21VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen shalt thou say in thine heart, Who hath begotten me these, seeing I have lost my children, and am desolate, a captive, and removing to and fro? and who hath brought up these? Behold, I was left alone; these, where had they been?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 21. - Who hath begotten me these? The Jewish Church is astounded at the influx of the Gentiles, and asks, \"Where did they come from? Who has made them my children? Who has trained them?\" That they are not her natural children she is sure, since she knows that she has been for a long time \"bereaved and unfruitful\" (Cheyne) - a captive, and a \"wanderer\" (Kay). It is certain that the Jewish Church did not at first altogether welcome the incoming of the Gentiles (Acts 11:1-3; Acts 15:1-11; Galatians 2:11-14, etc.). But the guidance of the Holy Spirit surmounted the difficulty (Acts 15:28).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah49:22VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThus saith the Lord GOD, Behold, I will lift up mine hand to the Gentiles, and set up my standard to the people: and they shall bring thy sons in their arms, and thy daughters shall be carried upon their shoulders.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 22. - I will lift up mine hand to the Gentiles. The new children - the new converts - are to come from the Gentiles; the fresh \"sons\" and \"daughters\" will be carried by the nations in their arms, and by the peoples upon their shoulders. It is usual to expound this and parallel passages (Isaiah 60:4; 66:20) of the return of the Jews to their own land by favour of the Gentiles, either when the decree of Cyrus went forth, or at some still future period. But perhaps the children intended are foster-children, actual Gentiles, whom their parents will bring to baptism. In the Assyrian sculptures, mothers are constantly represented as carrying their children upon their shoulders ('Ancient Monarchies,' vol. 1 p. 480).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah49:23VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd kings shall be thy nursing fathers, and their queens thy nursing mothers: they shall bow down to thee with their face toward the earth, and lick up the dust of thy feet; and thou shalt know that I am the LORD: for they shall not be ashamed that wait for me.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 23. - Kings shall be thy nursing fathers, and their queens thy nursing mothers; or, thy foster-fathers... thy foster-mothers. Kings and queens (sultanas) shall put themselves at the disposal of the Church, to nourish and cherish such of the Church's children as may be entrusted to their care. They shall bow down. They shall not seek to lord it over the Church, but shall acknowledge in the officers of the Church a spiritual authority superior to their own, before which they shall \"bow down,\" as Theodosius did. They shall even be willing, when they are conscious of guilt, to \"lick the dust\" under the Church's feet, or subject themselves to deep humiliation, that they may be restored. They shall not be ashamed that wait for me. Such as wait patiently and trust in the fulfilment of all these gracious promises shall escape shame, for the promises will assuredly be fulfilled.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah49:24VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTShall the prey be taken from the mighty, or the lawful captive delivered?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 24. - Shall the prey be taken, etc.? The incredulous among the exiles thought it well-nigh impossible that Babylon should be forced to disgorge her prey - the captives whose labours were so valuable to her. Babylon was mighty. By the laws of war she had a rightful claim to her captives. How was she to be induced or compelled to give them up?NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah49:25VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut thus saith the LORD, Even the captives of the mighty shall be taken away, and the prey of the terrible shall be delivered: for I will contend with him that contendeth with thee, and I will save thy children.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 25. - The captives of the mighty shall be taken away. The answer to the questions of ver. 24 is that, if Babylon is mighty, God is mightier. God will \"take away\" the captives, and \"save\" his \"children.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah49:26VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd I will feed them that oppress thee with their own flesh; and they shall be drunken with their own blood, as with sweet wine: and all flesh shall know that I the LORD am thy Saviour and thy Redeemer, the mighty One of Jacob.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 26. - I will feed them that oppress thee with their own flesh (comp. Isaiah 9:20). Civil disunion is intended, which will break the power of Babylon, and render her an easy prey to the Persians. The recently discovered inscriptions clearly show that this was the case. Nabonidus had alienated the affections of his subjects by changes in the religion of the country, and during the course of the war with Cyrus, many Babylonian tribes went over to the invaders, and fought against their own countrymen (see the 'Cylinder of Nabonidus;' and comp. Sayce, 'Ancient Empires of the East,' p. 357).

This verse has been well called a \"companion picture to Isaiah 3:6, 7.\" As there, in the evil time of God's judgment, the despairing men are represented as\" taking hold\" of a respectable man to make him their judge, so now the despairing women \"take hold\" of such a man and request him to allow them all to be regarded as his wives. There has been such a destruction - men are become so scarce - that no otherwise can women escape the shame and reproach of being unwedded and childless. Our own bread will we eat. They do not ask him to support them; they are able and willing to support themselves. To take away; rather, take thou away - the imperative mood, not the infinitive. Our reproach. Children were regarded as such a blessing in the ancient times that to be childless was a misfortune and a subject of reproach. Hagar \"despised\" the barren Sarai (Genesis 16:4). Her \"adversary provoked Hannah sore, because the Lord had shut up her womb\" (1 Samuel 1:6). Compare the lament of Antigone, who views it as a disgrace that she descends to the tomb unwed (Soph., 'Antig.,' 11. 813-816). Among the Jews childlessness was a special reproach, because it took away all possibility of the woman being in the line of the Messiah's descent (comp. Isaiah 54:1-4).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah4:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTIn that day shall the branch of the LORD be beautiful and glorious, and the fruit of the earth shall be excellent and comely for them that are escaped of Israel.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 2-6. - As the present prophecy (Isaiah 2-4.), though in the main one of threatening and denunciation, opened with a picture that was encouraging and comforting (Isaiah 2:2-4), so new it terminates with a similar picture. The evangelical prophet, like the great apostle of the Gentiles, is unwilling that any one should be \"swallowed up with overmuch sorrow.\" He will not separate the mercies of God from his judgments. Verse 2. - In that day shall the branch of the Lord, etc. Some see in this passage merely a promise that in the Messianic times the produce of the soil would become more abundant than ever before, its harvests richer, and its fruitage more luxuriant. But in the light of later prophecy it is scarcely possible to shut up the meaning within such narrow limits. The \"Branch\" of Isaiah can hardly be isolated altogether in a sound exegesis from the \"Branch\" of Jeremiah (Jeremiah 23:5; Jeremiah 33:15) and of Zechariah (Zechariah 3:8; Zechariah 6:12). Now, the \"Branch\" of Zechariah is stated to be \"a man\" (Zechariah 6:12: note that the word used for \"Branch\" is the same as Isaiah's, viz. tsemakh), and the \"Branch \"of Jeremiah is a King (Jeremiah 33:15). Moreover, Isaiah uses a nearly equivalent term (netser) in an admittedly Messianic sense. Although, therefore, there is some obscurity in the phrase, \"Branch of Jehovah,\" it would seem to be best to understand Isaiah as here intimating, what he elsewhere openly declares (Isaiah 11:1-5) - viz. the coming of the Messiah in the latter days as the ornament and glory of his people. Be beautiful and glorious; rather, for beauty and glory; or, for ornament and glory; i.e. for the ornament and glorification of Israel. And the fruit of the earth. It is argued with reason that the two clauses of this verse are parallel, not antithetical, and that as we understand the one, so must we understand the other. If, then, the \"Branch\" is the Messiah, so is \"the fruit of the earth\"-which may well be, since he was \"the grain of wheat\" which \"fell into the ground and, lied, and so brought forth much fruit\" (John 12:24). Excellent and comely; rather, for majesty and beauty (comp. Exodus 28:2, 40). Unto the escaped of Israel; i.e. \"to those who shall have our-rived the great calamity, and become citizens of the restored Jerusalem.\" Dr. Kay well remarks that \"the prophecy was adequately fulfilled only in those who 'saved themselves' from the generation which rejected Christ. That remnant was the germ of the Catholic Church, made such by being incorporated into the true Vine\" ('Speaker's Commentary,' note at loc.).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah4:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd it shall come to pass, that he that is left in Zion, and he that remaineth in Jerusalem, shall be called holy, even every one that is written among the living in Jerusalem:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 3. - He that is left... he that remaineth. Equivalent to the \"escaped\" of the preceding verse. Shall be called holy. Strikingly fulfilled in the filet that the early Christians were known as titter, \"holy,\" or κλητοὶ ἅγοι, \"those called to be holy,\" in the first age (Acts 9:13, 32, 41; Acts 26:10; Romans 1:7; 1 Corinthians 1:2; 2 Corinthians 1:1; Ephesians 1:1; Philippians 1:1, etc.). Perhaps, however, more is meant than this. The early Christians not only were called, but were \"holy.\" Even Gibbon places the innocent lives of the early Christians among the causes of the conversion of the Roman empire. Every one that is written among the living. A register of the \"living,\" or \"heirs of life,\" is here assumed, as in Exodus 32:32; Psalm 69:28; Daniel 12:1; Revelation 13:8; Revelation 21:27, etc. It is a \"book,\" however, out of which names may be \"blotted\" (Revelation 3:5).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah4:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWhen the Lord shall have washed away the filth of the daughters of Zion, and shall have purged the blood of Jerusalem from the midst thereof by the spirit of judgment, and by the spirit of burning.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 4. - When the Lord shall have washed away the filth of the daughters of Zion (see Isaiah 3:16-24). Sin must not be merely repented of and pardoned; it must be put away. There could be no Jerusalem, in which all should be \"called holy,\" until the moral defilement of the daughters of Zion was swept away. Purged the blood of Jerusalem from the midst (comp. Isaiah 1:15; Isaiah 59:3). It is possible, however, that the murder of infants in sacrifice to Moloch may be in the prophet's mind. Ahaz \"burnt his children in the fire after the abominations of the heathen\" (2 Chronicles 28:3). Manasseh did the same (2 Chronicles 33:6): and the practice was probably widespread among the people long before Isaiah's time (see Psalm 106:38; Isaiah 57:5). By the spirit of burning; or, by a blast of burning; i.e. a fiery blast which shall destroy everything (comp. Isaiah 1:31).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah4:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the LORD will create upon every dwelling place of mount Zion, and upon her assemblies, a cloud and smoke by day, and the shining of a flaming fire by night: for upon all the glory shall be a defence.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 5. - Upon every dwelling-place (\"over the whole habitation,\" Revised Version). Mr. Cheyne translates \"upon the whole site,\" and takes the \"site\" to be especially the temple. Makon seems certainly never to be used for anything but \"God's dwelling-place\" (Exodus 15:17; 1 Kings 8:13, 39, etc.; 2 Chronicles 6:2, 30, etc.; Ezra 2:68; Psalm 33:14; Psalm 89:14; Psalm 97:2; Psalm 104:5; Isaiah 18:4; Daniel 8:11). Perhaps, however, every dwelling-place of God, i.e. every Christian Church, is intended. On these, and on all Christian assemblies, there will rest a new presence of God - one which he will have \"created;\" recalling that of the pillar of fire and of cloud which rested in the wilderness on the Jewish tabernacle (Exodus 33:9; Exodus 40:34-38, etc.). A cloud and smoke by day. The \"pillar of the cloud\" is never said in the Pentateuch to have been one of\" smoke;\" but Sinai \"smoked\" when God descended on it (Exodus 19:18; Exodus 20:18), and the psalmist speaks of a \"smoke\" as issuing out of God's nostrils (Psalm 18:8). In the poetry of Isaiah,\" smoke, no less than \"cloud,\" symbolizes God's presence (see Isaiah 6:4). Upon all the glory shall be a defense; rather, as in the margin, a covering. Over all the glory of Zion, its purged temple and its purified assemblies, the presence of God shall rest like a canopy, protecting it.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah4:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd there shall be a tabernacle for a shadow in the daytime from the heat, and for a place of refuge, and for a covert from storm and from rain.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 6. - And there shall be, etc.; rather, and it (i.e. \"the canopy\") shall be a tabernacle, or bower, a shelter from the sun's heat by day, and from storm and rain both by day and night.

On account of her persistent \"backsliding,\" God had \"put away Israel,\" Judah's sister, and had \"given her a bill of divorce\" (Ver. 3:8). But he had not repudiated Judah; and her children were wrong to suppose themselves altogether cast off (see Isaiah 49:14). They had, in fact, by their transgressions, especially their idolatries, wilfully divorced themselves, or at any rate separated themselves, from God; but no sentence had gone forth from him to bar reconciliation and return. Or which of my creditors is it to whom I have sold you! Neither has God exercised the right, regarded as inherent in a parent (Exodus 21:7; 2 Kings 4:11; Nehemiah 6:5, 8), of selling his children to a creditor. They are not sold - he has \"taken no money for them\" (Psalm 44:12; Isaiah 52:3); and the Babylonians are thus not their rightful owners (Isaiah 49:24) - they are still God's children, his property, and the objects of his care. For your iniquities... for your transgressions; rather, by your iniquities... by your transgressions.

Such being the condition of things; Judah having rejected me, not I them - why, \"when I came\" and announced deliverance from Babylon, was there no response? Why did no champion appear?

But I am he who has power with his rebuke to dry up the sea (Exodus 14:21), to make rivers a wilderness (Exodus 7:20; Joshua 3:16, 17); in fact, to change the course of nature as seemeth him good, and accomplish his will against all obstacles. Is my hand shortened? i.e. \"is my power less than it was?\" Can any one suppose this? Surely what I have once done I can do again. If I delivered from Egypt, I can redeem from Babylon. Their fish stinketh (comp. Exodus 7:21).

The Egyptian plague of darkness (Exodus 10:21-23) is not adequate to the expressions here used. God means to assert his power of leaving all nature in absolute darkness, if he so choose - a power necessarily belonging to him who said, \"Let there be light; and there was light\" (Genesis 1:3). I make sackcloth their covering (see Revelation 6:12, \"The sun became black as sackcloth of hair\").NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah50:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe Lord GOD hath given me the tongue of the learned, that I should know how to speak a word in season to him that is weary: he wakeneth morning by morning, he wakeneth mine ear to hear as the learned.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 4-9. - A SOLILOQUY OF THE SERVANT OF JEHOVAH. The separateness of this passage has been maintained in the opening paragraph. That it is not of himself that the prophet here speaks, appearsNEWLINENEWLINE(1) from the self-assertion (vers, 4, 5, 9);NEWLINENEWLINE(2) from the depth of humiliation declared in ver. 6, which is beyond anything recorded of Isaiah. But if he does not speak of himself, he can scarcely speak of any other besides \"the Servant,\" of whom he has already said much (Isaiah 42:1-8; Isaiah 49:1-12), and of whom he has still much more to say (Isaiah 52:13-15; Isaiah 53:1-12). Verse 4. - The Lord God hath given me the tongue of the learned; literally, the tongue of disciples; i.e. a trained tongue, a well-taught tongue. Christ \"did nothing of himself; as the Father had taught him,\" so he spoke (John 8:28). That I should know how to speak a word in season to him that is weary; rather, that I shall know how to sustain by a word him that is weary. Compare, \"Come unto me, all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest\" (Matthew 11:28). He wakeneth morning by morning... mine ear. God held immediate and constant communication with the \"Servant\" - not enlightening him occasionally, as he did the prophets, by dreams and visions, but continually whispering in his ear. At no time did the Father \"leave him alone\" (John 8:29) or cease to speak to him. \"Morning by morning\" is not to be narrowed to the bare literal meaning, but to be taken in the sense of \"un-interruptedly.\" To hear as the learned; rather, to hear as disciples hear; i.e. attentively, submissively, gladly.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah50:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe Lord GOD hath opened mine ear, and I was not rebellious, neither turned away back.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 5. - The Lord hath opened mine ear. Some understand this of the boring of the ear for perpetual service (Psalm 40:6; Exodus 21:6); but it is perhaps better to regard it as intended to mark a contrast between the true Servant and the professed servants, or children of Israel. They \"did not hear; their ear was not opened; they were treacherous and rebellious from the womb\" (Isaiah 48:8). His ear was opened to receive God's word perpetually; he was not rebellious, did not turn away back. Even when most tried, his final word was, \"Not my will, but thine, be done\" (Luke 22:42).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah50:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTI gave my back to the smiters, and my cheeks to them that plucked off the hair: I hid not my face from shame and spitting.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 6. - I gave my back to the smiters (see Isaiah 53:5, ad fin.; and comp. Matthew 26:67; Matthew 27:26; John 19:1). My cheeks to them that plucked off the hair. This is a detail not historically recorded by the evangelists; but it may have had a literal fulfilment. Plucking off the hair was not unknown to the Jews as a punishment (see Nehemiah 13:25). I hid not my face from shame and spitting (see Matthew 26:67; Matthew 27:30). Spitting in the East marked at once contempt and abhorrence. It is a practice which continues to the present day.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah50:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor the Lord GOD will help me; therefore shall I not be confounded: therefore have I set my face like a flint, and I know that I shall not be ashamed.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 7. - For the Lord God will help me; rather, but the Lord God will help me.

He sets his face like a flint; i.e. makes it hard, impassive, expressionless, and at the same time determined, fixed not to give way (comp. Ezekiel 3:8, 9).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah50:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHe is near that justifieth me; who will contend with me? let us stand together: who is mine adversary? let him come near to me.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 8, 9. - He is near that justifieth me. God, who knows his innocence, is near at hand, and will shortly \"make his righteousness clear as the noonday.\" This was done when God raised up from the dead \"the Holy One and the Just\" (Acts 3:14). whom cruel men \"by wicked hands had crucified and slain\" (Acts 2:23). By the resurrection God acquitted Christ of the charge of blasphemy on which he had been condemned, and proclaimed him \"holy, harmless, undefiled, separate from sinners\" (Hebrews 7:26). Who will contend with me? (compare St. Paul's words in Romans 8:33, 34, \"It is God that justifieth. Who is he that condemneth?\"). God is the sole Judge of all men - of the \"Servant\" in his human capacity, no less than of others. If he acquits, it is idle for any accuser to stand forth and \"contend\" or \"condemn\" (ver. 9). God will help the innocent, whom he has acquitted, and will destroy the accuser by a secret but most sure destruction. The moth shall eat them up (comp. Psalm 39:11, and infra, Isaiah 51:8).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah50:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBehold, the Lord GOD will help me; who is he that shall condemn me? lo, they all shall wax old as a garment; the moth shall eat them up.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah50:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWho is among you that feareth the LORD, that obeyeth the voice of his servant, that walketh in darkness, and hath no light? let him trust in the name of the LORD, and stay upon his God.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 10, 11. - AN ADDRESS OF JEHOVAH TO HIS CHURCH. Some suppose that the Church of Hezekiah's reign is addressed; others the exiles towards the close of the Captivity period. The first verse is an exhortation, encouraging those who fear God, but have insufficient light, to trust in him. The second threatens such as \"kindle fire,\" or cause strife, with retribution. Verse 10. - That obeyeth the voice of his servant; that is, of \"his servant\" for the time being, whether Isaiah, or Jeremiah, or \"the Servant\" κατ ἐξοχήν That walketh in darkness. Not clearly seeing his way or knowing what his duty is, and so inclined to despond and doubt. Every such person is bidden to put aside his doubts, and trust wholly in the Name of the Lord, and stay upon his God. Hence light will shine in upon him, and his doubts will be resolved, and sufficient light will be granted him to direct his paths.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah50:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBehold, all ye that kindle a fire, that compass yourselves about with sparks: walk in the light of your fire, and in the sparks that ye have kindled. This shall ye have of mine hand; ye shall lie down in sorrow.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 11. - All ye that kindle a fire, that compass yourselves about with sparks; or, with firebrands. The persons intended seem to be those whose \"tongue is a fire, a world of iniquity\" (James 3:6), and who by means of it are employed in \"stirring up strife all the day long.\" They are condemned to be scorched by the fire which they have themselves kindled, to be made wretched by the strife which they have themselves caused to spring up. Their end, moreover, will be to lie down in sorrow; or, in torture (Cheyne). God will punish them in the next world for the misery which they have brought about in this, and will thus exercise retributive justice upon the wicked ones, whose main object in life has been to embitter the lives of their fellow-men.NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINE","Isa.51":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah51:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHearken to me, ye that follow after righteousness, ye that seek the LORD: look unto the rock whence ye are hewn, and to the hole of the pit whence ye are digged.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 1-8. - AN ADDRESS TO FAITHFUL ISRAEL, SUGGESTING TOPICS OF COMFORT. The address consists of three nearly equal strophes or stanzas, each commencing with a call, Shim'u elai, \"Hearken unto me,\" or Haqshibu elai, \"Attend to me.\" The prophet appears to be the speaker, and to address himself to the more faithful portion of the people. Verse 1. - Ye that follow after righteousness; i.e. \"ye that endeavour to lead righteous lives\" (comp. ver. 7). Ye that seek the Lord. And do not \"seek after idols,\" as too many of the exiles did (Isaiah 40:19; Isaiah 41:7; Isaiah 44:9-20; Isaiah 46:5-8, etc.). Look unto the rock... the hole; i.e. look back at your past history, especially at the early beginnings of it. Consider from what a slight and poor commencement - an aged man and a barren woman (ver. 2) - ye were raised up to be God's people, a numerous nation, a multitude like the sand of the sea. How came this result about? Was it not simply by the blessing of God?NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah51:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTLook unto Abraham your father, and unto Sarah that bare you: for I called him alone, and blessed him, and increased him.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 2. - I called him alone; or, I called him when he was but ode; i.e. before he had any children (comp. Ezekiel 33:24, \"Abraham was one, and he inherited the land\"). And blessed him (see Genesis 24:1, 35). And increased him; i.e. \"made him a father of many nations\" (Genesis 17:5). If God could multiply the progeny of ode man, much more could he make a flourishing nation out of the exiles, who, though but a \"remnant\" of the pro-Captivity Israel, were yet many thousands in number (see Ezra 2:64).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah51:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor the LORD shall comfort Zion: he will comfort all her waste places; and he will make her wilderness like Eden, and her desert like the garden of the LORD; joy and gladness shall be found therein, thanksgiving, and the voice of melody.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 3. - The Lord shall comfort Zion (comp. Isaiah 40:1; Isaiah 49:3; Isaiah 51:12; Isaiah 52:9, etc.). Literally, the word used is has comforted; i.e. has so determined the matter in his counsels that it may be considered as already accomplished. Her waste places... her wilderness... her desert. Though Nebuchadnezzar \"left of the poor of the land to be vinedressers and husbandmen\" (2 Kings 25:12; Jeremiah 52:16), yet the population was not sufficient to maintain cultivation generally. Thus, much of Judaea, during the absence of the exiles, became a \"wilderness\" and a \"desert\" (see Ezekiel 36:34). Like Eden... like the garden of the Lord. The Prophet Joel compares Judaea before its desolation to \"the garden of Eden\" (Joel 2:3): and Ezekiel, like Isaiah, prophesies that it shall once more become \"like the garden of Eden,\" when the exiles have returned to it (Ezekiel 37:35). With the last-named writer, Eden represents all that is glorious, not in nature only, but in art (Ezekiel 28:13; Ezekiel 31:8, 9, 16, 18). The voice of melody (comp. Isaiah 35:10, and infra, ver. 11). As music ceases out of the land in time of affliction (Isaiah 24:8), so when a \"time of refreshing from the Lord\" arrives, there is at once singing and \"melody\" (comp. Revelation 5:8; Revelation 14:2; Revelation 15:2).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah51:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHearken unto me, my people; and give ear unto me, O my nation: for a law shall proceed from me, and I will make my judgment to rest for a light of the people.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 4. - Hearken unto me; rather, attend to me - a stronger term than \"hearken\" - attend, and hear of a greater blessing than the restoration of the land of Judah to cultivation and fruitfulness. God, enthroned anew in Zion, will from thence send forth his light and his truth to the nations, will make his Law known to them, and allow them to partake of his salvation. O my nation. Some manuscripts have \"O ye nations.\" But the reading is undoubtedly a wrong one. A law shall proceed from me. The Christian \"law\" - the new covenant - is probably intended. This became, by the preaching of the apostles, a light of the people, or rather, of the peoples.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah51:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTMy righteousness is near; my salvation is gone forth, and mine arms shall judge the people; the isles shall wait upon me, and on mine arm shall they trust.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 5. - My righteousness is near; my salvation is gone forth. \"One day is with the Lord as a thousand years, and. a thousand years as one day\" (2 Peter 3:8). Isaiah always speaks as if the Messianic kingdom was to supervene almost immediately on the return of the exiles to Palestine. It was not revealed to him that there would be an interval of from five hundred to six hundred years between the two events. By God's \"righteousness\" here we must understand his righteous plans for the redemption of his people through Christ, and for the punishment of those who resist his will and remain impenitent. The salvation and the judgment are the two parts of the \"righteousness.\" The isles shall wait upon me (comp. Isaiah 41:1, 5; Isaiah 42:4, 10, 12; Isaiah 49:1; Isaiah 60:9, etc.; and the comment on Isaiah 42:4). On mine arm shall they trust. God's \"arm\" is his executive power - that might by which he effects his purposes. The \"isles\" or \"countries\" that have been expecting the coming of a Deliverer will have faith in his power to redeem and save them. Christianity was received with more readiness by the Gentiles than by the \"peculiar people\" (Acts 11:21; Acts 13:42, 46; Acts 14:1, 2; Acts 17:4, 5; Acts 18:6, etc.).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah51:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTLift up your eyes to the heavens, and look upon the earth beneath: for the heavens shall vanish away like smoke, and the earth shall wax old like a garment, and they that dwell therein shall die in like manner: but my salvation shall be for ever, and my righteousness shall not be abolished.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 6. - Lift up your eyes to the heavens. Look to that which seems to you most stable and most certain to endure - the vast firmament of the heavens, and the solid earth beneath it, of which God \"bears up the pillars\" (Psalm l25:3). Both these, and man too, are in their nature perishable, and will (or may) vanish away and cease to be. But God, and his power to save, and his eternal law of right, can never pass away, but must endure for evermore. Let Israel be sure that the righteous purposes of God with respect to their own deliverance from Babylon, and to the conversion of the Gentiles, stand firm, and that they will most certainly be accomplished. The heavens shall vanish away like smoke (comp. Psalm 102:26; Matthew 24:35; 2 Peter 3:10-12). And the earth shall wax old like a garment. So also in Psalm 102:26 and Hebrews 1:11. The new heaven and new earth promised by Isaiah (Isaiah 65:17; 66:22), St. Peter (2 Peter 3:13), and St. John (Revelation 21:1) are created in the last times, because \"the first heaven and the first earth have passed away.\" They that dwell therein shall die in like manner. Dr. Kay observes that the Hebrew text does not say, \"in like manner,\" but \"as in like manner.\" Man is not subject to the same law of perishableness as the external world, but to a different law. External things simply \"pass away\" and are no more. Man disappears from the earth, but continues to exist somewhere. He has, by God's gift, a life that is to be unceasing.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah51:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHearken unto me, ye that know righteousness, the people in whose heart is my law; fear ye not the reproach of men, neither be ye afraid of their revilings.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 7. - Hearken unto me, ye that know righteousness. The highest grade of faithfulness is here addressed - not those who \"seek\" (ver. 1), but those who have found - who \"know righteousness,\" and have the \"law\" of God in their \"hearts.\" Such persons may still be liable to one weakness - they may \"fear the reproach of men.\" The prophet exhorts them to put aside this fear, rememberingNEWLINENEWLINE(1) the nothingness of humanity, andNEWLINENEWLINE(2) the eternity and imperishableness of God's judgments.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah51:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor the moth shall eat them up like a garment, and the worm shall eat them like wool: but my righteousness shall be for ever, and my salvation from generation to generation.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 8. - The moth shall eat them (comp. Isaiah 50:9). If men themselves never wholly pass away (see the comment on ver. 6), yet it is otherwise with their judgments. These perish absolutely, disappear, and are utterly forgotten.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah51:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAwake, awake, put on strength, O arm of the LORD; awake, as in the ancient days, in the generations of old. Art thou not it that hath cut Rahab, and wounded the dragon?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 9-11. - AN APPEAL OF THE PROPHET TO GOD TO AROUSE HIMSELF, WITH A PROMISE OF ISRAEL'S RESTORATION. There has been much doubt as to the utterer of this \"splendid apostrophe.\" Zion, the prophet, the angels, Jehovah, and God the Son pleading with God the Father, have been suggested. To us it seems simplest and best to assign the passage to the prophet. Verse 9. - Awake, awake (comp. Psalm 7:6; Psalm 35:23; Psalm 44:23; Psalm 78:65). When God neglects the prayers and supplications of his people, he is spoken of as \"asleep,\" and needing to be awoke by a loud cry. The anthropomorphism is obvious, and of course not to be taken literally (see 1 Kings 18:27, ad fin.). Put on strength. Gird the strength to thee (Psalm 93:1) which thou hadst laid aside while thou wept asleep. Art thou not it that hath cut Rahab? rather, was it not thou that didst cleave Rahab in pieces? Here, as in Psalm 87:4 and Psalm 89:10, \"Rahab\" would seem to be a symbolical expression for Egypt. \"Rahab\" is literally \"pride,\" or \"the proud one.\" The event alluded to, both here and in Psalm 89:10, is the destruction of Pharaoh's host in the Red Sea (see ver. 10). And wounded the dragon. \"The dragon\" is another symbol of the Egyptian power (comp. Ezekiel 29:3, \"Pharaoh, King of Egypt, the great dragon that lieth in the midst of his rivers\"). Originally designating God's great enemy, Satan (Genesis 3:14; Revelation 12:7-9; Revelation 20:2), it is a term which comes to be applied to the adversaries of the Almighty generally.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah51:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTArt thou not it which hath dried the sea, the waters of the great deep; that hath made the depths of the sea a way for the ransomed to pass over?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 10. - Art thou not it which hath dried the sea? rather, was it not thou that didst dry up the sea? (comp. Exodus 14:21, 22). The waters of the Red Sea are called those of \"the great deep,\" because they are a portion of the circumambient ocean, not a tideless land-locked basin, like the Mediterranean. That hath made; rather, that madest. The allusion is to the single occasion of the passage of the Red Sea by the Israelites. Ver. 11. - The redeemed of the Lord (see the comment on Isaiah 35:10. where the same passage occurs with scarcely any variation). Isaiah is not averse to repetitions (see Isaiah 5:25; Isaiah 9:12, 17, 21; Isaiah 10:4; Isaiah 11:1; Isaiah 65:25; Isaiah 48:22; 57:21, etc.).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah51:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTTherefore the redeemed of the LORD shall return, and come with singing unto Zion; and everlasting joy shall be upon their head: they shall obtain gladness and joy; and sorrow and mourning shall flee away.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah51:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTI, even I, am he that comforteth you: who art thou, that thou shouldest be afraid of a man that shall die, and of the son of man which shall be made as grass;VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 12-16. - AN ADDRESS OF GOD TO HIS CAPTIVE PEOPLE. There is no very clear connection between this passage and the preceding, to which it is certainly not an answer. God comforts the captives under the oppression which they are sufferingNEWLINENEWLINE(1) by reminding them of their oppressors' weakness and short-livedness;NEWLINENEWLINE(2) by assuring them of speedy deliverance (ver. 14); andNEWLINENEWLINE(3) by impressing upon them his own power as shown in the past, which is a guarantee that he will protect them in the future (vers. 15, 16). Ver. 12. - I am he that comforteth you (comp. ver. 3, and the comment ad loc). Who art thou? Art thou a poor, weak, powerless, unprotected people, which might well tremble at the powerful Babylonians: or art thou not rather a people under the special protection of Jehovah, bound, therefore, to fear no one? As grass (comp. Isaiah 37:27; Isaiah 11:6-8).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah51:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd forgettest the LORD thy maker, that hath stretched forth the heavens, and laid the foundations of the earth; and hast feared continually every day because of the fury of the oppressor, as if he were ready to destroy? and where is the fury of the oppressor?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 13. - And forgettest the Lord thy Maker. It is not so much apostasy as want of a lively and practical faith with which captive Israel is here reproached. They did not deny God - they only left him out of sight, neglected him, forgot him. That hath stretched forth the heavens (comp. Isaiah 40:22; Isaiah 42:5; Isaiah 44:24; Isaiah 45:12, etc.). And laid the foundations of the earth (see Isaiah 48:13; Psalm 102:25; Hebrews 1:10). And hast feared continually... because of the fury of the oppressor. (On the sufferings of the Israelites under their Babylonian oppressors, see the comment on Isaiah 42:22, and again on Isaiah 47:6.) By the present passage it would appear that life itself was not safe from their cruel fury, when their victims had exasperated them. Where is the fury of the oppressor? All their violence and rage will come to nought, when they in their turn become subject to the conquering Persians.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah51:14VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe captive exile hasteneth that he may be loosed, and that he should not die in the pit, nor that his bread should fail.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 14. - The captive exile hasteneth that he may be loosed; rather, he that is bent down hasteneth to be released; i.e. such of the exiles as were cramped and bent by fetters, or by the stocks, would speedily, on the fall of Babylon, obtain their release. They would not \"die unto the pit,\" i.e. so as to belong to the pit and to be east into it, but would live and have a sufficiency of sustenance.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah51:15VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut I am the LORD thy God, that divided the sea, whose waves roared: The LORD of hosts is his name.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 15. - But I am the Lord thy God, that divided the sea; rather, for I, the Lord thy God, am he that divided the sea (comp. ver. 10). The reference is once more to the great miracle wrought at the Exodus, when the Red Sea was \"divided\" before the host of Israelites (Exodus 14:21; comp. Psalm 74:13). Whose waves roared (see Exodus 14:27; Exodus 15:10).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah51:16VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd I have put my words in thy mouth, and I have covered thee in the shadow of mine hand, that I may plant the heavens, and lay the foundations of the earth, and say unto Zion, Thou art my people.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 16. - And I have put my words in thy mouth. Some commentators detach this verse altogether from the preceding passage, and regard it as a fragment intruded here out of its proper place by some unaccountable accident. From the close resemblance of the expressions used to those in Isaiah 49:2, they consider that the person addressed must be \"the Servant of Jehovah,\" and hence conclude that the verse \"originally stood in some other context\" (Cheyne). It is, however, quite possible to regard Israel as still addressed; since Israel too was the recipient of God's words (see Isaiah 59:21), and was protected by God's hand from destruction, and kept in existence until the happy time should come when God would create a new heaven and a new earth (Isaiah 65:17) for Israel's dwelling-place, and say unto Zion - i.e. to the \"new Jerusalem\" Revelation 21:2) - Thou art my people. This crowning promise well terminates the comforting address wherewith Jehovah at this time saw fit to cheer and encourage his captive people.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah51:17VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAwake, awake, stand up, O Jerusalem, which hast drunk at the hand of the LORD the cup of his fury; thou hast drunken the dregs of the cup of trembling, and wrung them out.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 17-23. - AN ADDRESS OF THE PROPHET TO JERUSALEM. The comfort afforded to Israel generally is now concentrated on Jerusalem. Her condition during the long period of the Captivity is deplored, and her want of a champion to assert her cause and raise her out of the dust is lamented (vers. 17-20). After this, an assurance is given her that the miseries which she has suffered shall pass from her to her great enemy, by whom the dregs of the \"cup of trembling\" shall be drained, and the last drop wrung out (vers. 21-23). Verse 17. - Awake, awake (comp. ver. 9 and Isaiah 52:1). Isaiah marks the breaks in his prophecy, sometimes by a repetition of terminal clauses, which have the effect of a refrain (Isaiah 5:25; Isaiah 9:12, 17, 21; Isaiah 10:4; and Isaiah 48:22; 57:21); sometimes by a repetition of initial clauses of a striking character (Isaiah 5:8, 11, 20; Isaiah 13:1; Isaiah 15:1; Isaiah 17:1; Isaiah 19:1; Isaiah 21:1, 11; Isaiah 22:1; Isaiah 23:1; Isaiah 28:1; Isaiah 29:1; Isaiah 30:1; Isaiah 31:1; Isaiah 33:1; Isaiah 48:1, 12, 16; Isaiah 50:4, 7, 9, etc.). Here we have thrice over \"Awake, awake\" - not, however, an exact repetition in the Hebrew, but a near approach to it each summons forming the commencement of a new paragraph or subsection. Which hast drunk at the hand of the Lord the cup of his fury. The cup of God's fury was poured out on Jerusalem when the city was taken by Nebuchadnezzar, the temple, the royal palace, and the houses of the nobles burnt (2 Kings 25:9), the walls broken down (2 Kings 25:10), and the bulk of the inhabitants carried away captive to Babylon (2 Kings 25:11; comp. 2 Chronicles 34:25; Jeremiah 42:18; Jeremiah 44:6; Ezekiel 22:31, etc.). \"The cup of God's fury\" is an expression used by Jeremiah (Jeremiah 25:15). The dregs of the cup; rather, perhaps, the goblet-cup (Cheyne), or the out-swollen cup. It is the fulness of the measure of Jerusalem's punishment, not its character, which is pointed at.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah51:18VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThere is none to guide her among all the sons whom she hath brought forth; neither is there any that taketh her by the hand of all the sons that she hath brought up.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 18. - None to guide her. From the time that Johanan, the son of Kareah, and the other \"captains of the forces,\" quitted Judaea and fled into Egypt, taking with them Jeremiah and Baruch (Jeremiah 43:5-7), there was no one left in the country with any authority or any ability to direct affairs. The city, no doubt, suffered by this state of things, becoming more ruined and more desolate than it would have been otherwise. Had Johanan and the Jews under him remained in the land, God had promised to \"build them, and not pull them down;\" to \"plant them, and not pluck them up\" (Jeremiah 42:10). Thus Jerusalem's extreme desolation was not wholly the result of the Babylonian conquest, but was partly due to the after-misconduct of the Jews left in the country.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah51:19VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThese two things are come unto thee; who shall be sorry for thee? desolation, and destruction, and the famine, and the sword: by whom shall I comfort thee?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 19. - These two things. What are the \"two things,\" it is asked, since four are mentioned - desolation, and destruction, and the famine, and the sword? The right answer seems to be that of Aben Ezra and Kimchi, that the two things are \"desolation,\" or rather \"wasting\" within, produced by \"famine;\" and \"destruction\" without, produced by \"the sword.\" Who shall be sorry for thee? rather, who will mourn with thee? Jerusalem is without friends; no man condoles with her over her misfortunes. God alone feels compassion; but even he scarce knows how to comfort. By whom? rather, how? (comp. Amos 7:2, 5).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah51:20VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThy sons have fainted, they lie at the head of all the streets, as a wild bull in a net: they are full of the fury of the LORD, the rebuke of thy God.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 20. - Thy sons have fainted, they lie; rather, thy sons fainted; they lay. The prophet describes the siege and capture of Jerusalem as past, because his standpoint is the time of the Captivity. He depicts the inhabitants of Jerusalem as \"faint\" through famine, and so weak that they lie prostrate about the streets. As a wild bull in a net; rather, like a gazelle in a net - panting, exhausted, incapable of the hast resistance. They are full of the fury of the Lord; i.e. the fury of the Lord has been fully poured out upon them.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah51:21VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTTherefore hear now this, thou afflicted, and drunken, but not with wine:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 21. - Drunken, but not with wine (comp. Isaiah 29:9; and see above, ver. 17, which shows that the appearance of drunkenness had been produced by Jerusalem drinking the cup of God's wrath).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah51:22VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThus saith thy Lord the LORD, and thy God that pleadeth the cause of his people, Behold, I have taken out of thine hand the cup of trembling, even the dregs of the cup of my fury; thou shalt no more drink it again:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 22. - The Lord... that pleadeth the cause of his people (comp. Jeremiah 50:34, which contains an allusion to this passage). As his people have a relentless adversary, who accuses them continually, and pleads against them (Revelation 12:10), so it is needful that they should have an untiring advocate. God himself is this Advocate. The dregs of the cup (see the comment on ver. 17, ad fin.).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah51:23VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut I will put it into the hand of them that afflict thee; which have said to thy soul, Bow down, that we may go over: and thou hast laid thy body as the ground, and as the street, to them that went over.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 23. - I will put it into the hand of them that afflict thee. Babylon, the oppressor of Judah, shall in her turn be made to drink of the cup of which Judah had so long drunk, and shall suffer nearly the same woes which she had inflicted. Meanwhile, Judah should cease to drink of the cup, and have \"a time of refreshing.\" Bow down, that we may go over; i.e. \"submit yourselves to the uttermost, that we may put upon you the most extreme indignity.\" The metaphor is drawn from the actual practise of conquerors, who made captive kings prostrate themselves, and placed their feet upon their necks, or otherwise trampled upon them (see Joshua 10:24; and comp. 'Ancient hierarchies,' vol. 3:p. 7).NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINE","Isa.52":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah52:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAwake, awake; put on thy strength, O Zion; put on thy beautiful garments, O Jerusalem, the holy city: for henceforth there shall no more come into thee the uncircumcised and the unclean.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 1-6. - FURTHER ADDRESS OF THE PROPHET TO JERUSALEM. Zion is exhorted to rise from the dust, throw off her bonds, and assert her freedom (vers. 1, 2). God will deliver her from this third captivity for his Name's sake, which her oppressors blaspheme (vers. 3-6). Verse 1. - Awake, awake; put on thy strength (comp. Isaiah 51:9). God can help those only who help themselves. The \"arm of the Lord\" having been called upon to \"put on strength\" in order to help Zion, Zion is now exhorted to do her part, and put on her own strength. Nor is she to stop there; she is further to rut on her beautiful garments - to array herself in the glorious robes which befit her as a royal and a holy city, and show herself once more a queen, instead of being content to remain grovelling as a captive (Isaiah 51:20, 21). Henceforth there shall no more come into thee the uncircumcised. Foreigners shall no more visit Jerusalem to injure her or exult over her misfortunes (comp. Joel 3:17). When the influx of the Gentiles comes (Isaiah 42:6; Isaiah 49:6, 22, etc.), it will be one of Gentiles who are \"circumcised in heart and lips,\" and no longer \"unclean\" (Acts 10:15).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah52:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTShake thyself from the dust; arise, and sit down, O Jerusalem: loose thyself from the bands of thy neck, O captive daughter of Zion.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 2. - Shake thyself from the dust (compare the opposite command given to Babylon, \"Come down, sit in the dust\" Isaiah 47:1). Zion was to arise, shake from her all trace of the dust in which she had been so long lying, and then calmly seat herself upon a seat of dignity. Loose thyself from the bands of thy neck. The Hebrew text has. \"The bands of thy neck are unloosened;\" i.e. I have caused thy chains to fall from thee - thou hast only to \"rise,\" and thou wilt find thyself free. Captives in ancient times were often fastened together by a thong or chain passed round their necks (see Rawlinson, 'History of Ancient Egypt,' vol. 1 p. 473). Daughter of Zion. The prophet passes, by an easy transition, from the city to the nation, which continues to be the object of address in the remainder of the discourse.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah52:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor thus saith the LORD, Ye have sold yourselves for nought; and ye shall be redeemed without money.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 3. - Ye have sold yourselves for nought; rather, for nought were ye sold. God received nothing when he allowed his people to become the slaves of the Babylonians. He took no price for them (see Isaiah 50:1), and therefore is free to claim them back without payment (comp. Isaiah 45:13). He has but to say the word; and he is about to say it.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah52:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor thus saith the Lord GOD, My people went down aforetime into Egypt to sojourn there; and the Assyrian oppressed them without cause.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 4. - My people went down... into Egypt ... the Assyrian oppressed them. Israel had experienced three captivities. They \"went down\" voluntarily into Egypt, on invitation, to sojourn, and were there cruelly and unjustly reduced to a servile condition (Exodus 1:13, 14). They (or a great part of them) were violently carried into captivity by the Assyrian kings, Tiglath-Pileser (2 Kings 15:29), Sargon (2 Kings 17:6), and Sennacherib (2 Kings 18:13; 'Eponym Canon,' p. 134), who, without cause, grievously \"oppressed\" them. Now they are suffering under a third captivity in Babylonia. What is to be the Divine action under these circumstances?NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah52:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTNow therefore, what have I here, saith the LORD, that my people is taken away for nought? they that rule over them make them to howl, saith the LORD; and my name continually every day is blasphemed.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 5. - What have I here? rather, what have r to do here? i.e. what is the task before me - the work that I have to perform? There are three principal considerations by which the answer to this question has to be determined.NEWLINENEWLINE(1) The Babylonians have obtained possession of the Israelites without purchase - for nought;NEWLINENEWLINE(2) they use their authority harshly and brutally; andNEWLINENEWLINE(3) they continually blaspheme the Name of Jehovah. All three are grounds for bringing the captivity to an end, and coming forward with the cry of a deliverer, \"Here I am.\" Make them to howl; rather, howl; i.e. insult over the captives with shouts and yells of triumph. The prophet is speaking of the Babylonian oppressors, not of the native \"rulers,\" who exercised a certain amount of authority over the captives (see Delitzsch and Cheyne). My Name... is blasphemed. Cruel taskmasters vexed the captives by insulting their God.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah52:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTTherefore my people shall know my name: therefore they shall know in that day that I am he that doth speak: behold, it is I.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 6. - Therefore. Because of the \"howling\" and the \"blasphemy.\" My people shall know my Name; i.e. \"my people shall know by practical experience that I am all that my name of El or Elohim - 'the Strong,' ' the Powerful' - implies.\" They shall know in that day. The \"day\" when God would come to their help and deliver them from their oppressors - when they would call upon him, and he would manifest himself (Isaiah 58:9), responding to their appeal as distinctly as though he said, \"Here I am.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah52:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHow beautiful upon the mountains are the feet of him that bringeth good tidings, that publisheth peace; that bringeth good tidings of good, that publisheth salvation; that saith unto Zion, Thy God reigneth!VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 7-12. - A VISION OF THE DAY OF DELIVERANCE. The prophet sees the messenger come bounding over the mountains of Judaea, to bring the news to Jerusalem that her deliverance is come (ver. 7). The angelic watchers sing with joy (ver. 8). The prophet calls upon the waste places of Jerusalem to do the same, and dwells on the greatness of the mercy wrought (vers. 9, 10). Finally, he exhorts the exiles to avail themselves of the permission to quit Babylon, and prophesies that they will go forth in peace, without hurry, under the guidance and protection of God (vers. 11, 12). Verse 7. - How beautiful upon the mountains are the feet of him that bringeth good tidings, that publisheth peace! (comp. Nahum 1:15, which is almost a repetition of the passage). The primary meaning is undoubtedly that assigned to the words in the introductory paragraph; but this does not hinder there being also a secondary meaning, viz. the Messianic one of Romans 10:15. Jerusalem's deliverance is a type of the redemption of the world by Christ. That saith unto Zion, Thy God reigneth! So long as Israel was in captivity, and Jerusalem in ruins, God's earthly sovereignty (1 Samuel 12:12) was in abeyance. The moment that the Jews were set free and allowed to return and to rebuild their city, his. sovereignty was re-established.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah52:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThy watchmen shall lift up the voice; with the voice together shall they sing: for they shall see eye to eye, when the LORD shall bring again Zion.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 8. - Thy watchmen shall lift up the voice; literally, The voice of thy watchers. They have lifted up the voice; they sing (or, shout joyfully, Kay) together. The \"watchmen\" are regarded by some as the prophets of the Captivity-time (Delitzsch), by others - as the faithful who \"waited for the redemption of Israel\" (Kay); but are considered by the best critics (Cheyne, Alexander) to be \"supersensible beings,\" or, in other words, angels, who \"watch\" over the fortunes of Israel, and sympathize with their weal and woe (see Daniel 4:13, 17, 23, etc.). These \"watchers\" now \"sing\" or \"shout\" with joy. They shall see eye to eye (compare the \"face to face\" of Numbers 14:14; Deuteronomy 34:10). The \"watchers\" would watch closely God's dealings with his Church, and would see them as clearly as a man sees his friend when he leeks into his face. When the Lord shall bring again Zion. It is, perhaps, best to translate, with Houbigant and Mr. Cheyne, \"When the Lord shall return to Zion.\" The prophet sees God as the Leader of his people, not merely by his providence bringing them back, but \"returning\" at their head (camp. ver. 12).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah52:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBreak forth into joy, sing together, ye waste places of Jerusalem: for the LORD hath comforted his people, he hath redeemed Jerusalem.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 9. - Ye waste places of Jerusalem (comp. Isaiah 44:26; Isaiah 49:19; Isaiah 64:10, 11). The city had not been wholly destroyed. Only the temple, the royal palace, and the houses of the nobles had been \"burnt with fire\" (2 Kings 25:9; 2 Chronicles 36:19). The poorer houses had been left. Even these, however, must in the space of fifty years have for the most part fallen into decay. The ruins are now called upon to join in the general chorus of rejoicing, as they rise from their ashes. Hath comforted... hath redeemed. Perfects of prophetic certitude.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah52:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe LORD hath made bare his holy arm in the eyes of all the nations; and all the ends of the earth shall see the salvation of our God.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 10. - The nations... the ends of the earth. It may well add to the general joy that the work wrought for Israel is not \"a thing done in a corner,\" but one on which the eyes of the\" nations\" have been turned. and to which the attention of\" the ends of the earth\" has been called (comp. Isaiah 41:5). The holy arm of Jehovah, made bare for battle, has been seen far and wide. The world has stood to gaze at the contest between Persia and Babylon.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah52:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTDepart ye, depart ye, go ye out from thence, touch no unclean thing; go ye out of the midst of her; be ye clean, that bear the vessels of the LORD.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 11. - Go ye out from thence; i.e. \"from Babylon\" - the standpoint of the prophet in the present chapter being Jerusalem. When the time came, earnest exhortations to depart would be found not superfluous, for there would be an indisposition on the part of some to quit their possessions, and of others to affront the perils of the way. Touch no unclean thing. Bring with you none of the Babylonian idols, none of the Babylonian charms, spells, and the like (see the comment on Isaiah 47:9). Be ye clean; rather, purify yourselves. The departing captives generally are called upon to avoid polluting themselves with the unclean things of Babylon; but for those who bear the vessels of the Lord this negative purity is insufficient. They are for-really to purify themselves (2 Chronicles 29:34) before undertaking their sacred office. By \"the vessels of the Lord\" we must understand those which Nebuchadnezzar carried off from the temple (2 Kings 25:14-16; Daniel 1:2), and which, on the return of the Jews from captivity, were restored by Cyrus (Ezra 1:7-11) and Artaxerxes (Ezra 8:25-34).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah52:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor ye shall not go out with haste, nor go by flight: for the LORD will go before you; and the God of Israel will be your rereward.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 12. With haste... by flight. As at the going forth from Egypt (Exodus 12:33; Exodus 16:5). Then they were \"thrust out;\" now there would be no need of hurry. They would have the free permission of their sovereign to depart at their own time, and might proceed with calm deliberateness. God would go before them, as he did on that former occasion (Exodus 13:21), though not now visibly; and he would also defend them from attacks by the way, being at once their Guide and their Rereward, or Rearguard.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah52:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBehold, my servant shall deal prudently, he shall be exalted and extolled, and be very high.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 13-15. - PRELUDE TO THE \"GREAT PASSIONAL.\" It is generally allowed by modern commentators that this passage is more closely connected with what follows it than with what precedes. Some would detach it altogether from ch. 52. and attach it to ch. 53. But this is not necessary. The passage has a completeness in itself. It is a connecting link. The exaltation of Israel, the collective \"Servant of the Lord\" (Isaiah 44:1, 21), brings to the prophet's mind the exaltation of the individual \"Servant\" (Isaiah 42:1-7; Isaiah 43:10; Isaiah 49:1-12), through which alone the full exaltation of Israel is possible. He is bound to complete his account of the individual \"Servant\" by telling of his exaltation, and of the road which led to it. This is done in ch. 53, in what has been called the \"Great Passional.\" But the \"Great Pas-signal\" needs a \"prelude,\" an \"introduction,\" if only as indicative' of its greatness. And this prelude we have here, in these three verses, which briefly noteNEWLINENEWLINE(1) the fact of the exaltation;NEWLINENEWLINE(2) the depth of the humiliation preceding it; andNEWLINENEWLINE(3) the far-extending blessedness which shall result to the world from both. Verse 13. - My Servant shall deal prudently; rather, shall deal wisely; i.e. shall so act throughout his mission as to secure it the most complete success. \"Wisdom is justified of her children,\" and of none so entirely justified as of him \"in whom were all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge hid away\" (Colossians 2:3). Exalted and extolled; or, high and lifted up - the same expressions as are used of the Almighty in Isaiah 6:1 and Isaiah 57:15. Even there, however, seems to the prophet rot enough; so he adds, \"and exalted exceedingly\" (comp. Isaiah 53:10-12 and Philippians 2:6-9).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah52:14VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAs many were astonied at thee; his visage was so marred more than any man, and his form more than the sons of men:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 14. - As many were astonied at thee. The world was \"astonied\" to see, in One come to deliver it, no outward show of grandeur or magnificence, no special beauty or \"comeliness\" (Isaiah 53:2), but a Presence unattractive to the mass of men at all times, and in the end so cruelly marred and disfigured as to retain scarcely any resemblance to the ordinary form and face of man. The prophet, as Delitzsch says, sits at the foot of the cross on Calvary, and sees the Redeemer as he hung upon the accursed tree, after he had been buffeted, and crowned with thorns, and smitten, and scourged, and crucified, when his face was covered with bruises and with gore, and his frame and features distorted with agony.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah52:15VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTSo shall he sprinkle many nations; the kings shall shut their mouths at him: for that which had not been told them shall they see; and that which they had not heard shall they consider.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 15. - So shall he sprinkle many nations. The Septuagint has, \"So shall many nations marvel at him;\" and this translation is followed by Gesenius and Ewald. Mr. Cheyne thinks that the present Hebrew text is corrupt, and suggests that a verb was used antithetical to the \"astonied\" of ver. 14, expressing \"joyful surprise.\" It is certainly hard to see how the idea of \"sprinkling,\" even if it can mean \"purifying,\" comes in here. Kings shall shut their mouths at him; rather, because of him. In reverential awe of his surpassing greatness (comp. Micah 7:16). That which had not been told them shall they see. They will learn the facts of Christ's humiliation, sufferings, death, resurrection, and ascension to heaven - events that it had never entered into the heart of man to conceive, and of which, therefore, no tongue had ever spoken.NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINE","Isa.53":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah53:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWho hath believed our report? and to whom is the arm of the LORD revealed?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 1. - Who hath believed? Isaiah felt that he spoke, mainly, to unbelieving ears (see above, Isaiah 28:9-15; Isaiah 29:10-15; Isaiah 30:9-11; Isaiah 42:23, etc.). The unbelief was likely to be intensified when so marvellous a prophecy was delivered as that which he was now commissioned to put forth. Still, of course, there is rhetorical exaggeration in the question, which seems to imply that no one would believe. Our report; literally, that which has been heard by us. But the word is used technically for a prophetic revelation (see Isaiah 28:9, 19; Jeremiah 49:14). Here it would seem to refer especially to the Messianic prophecies delivered by Isaiah. To whom is the arm of the Lord revealed? The \"arm of the Lord,\" which has been \"made bare in the eyes of all the nations\" (Isaiah 52:10), yet requires the eye of faith to see it. Many Jews would not see the working of God's providence in the victories of Cyrus, or in the decision to which he came to restore the Jews to their own country. Unbelief can always assign the most plainly providential arrangements to happy accident.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah53:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor he shall grow up before him as a tender plant, and as a root out of a dry ground: he hath no form nor comeliness; and when we shall see him, there is no beauty that we should desire him.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 2. - For he shall grow up; rather, now he grew up. The verbs are, all of them, in the past, or completed tense, until ver. 7, and are to be regarded as \"perfects of prophetic certitude.\" As Mr. Cheyne remarks, \"All has been finished before the foundations of the world in the Divine counsels.\" Before him; i.e. \"before Jehovah\" - under the fostering care of Jehovah (comp. Luke 2:40, 52). God the Father had his eye ever fixed upon the Son with watchfulness and tenderness and love. As a tender plant; literally, as a sapling, or as a sucker (comp. Job 8:16; Job 14:7; Job 15:30; Psalm 80:12; Ezekiel 17:4, 22; Hosea 14:6). The \"branch\" of Isaiah 11:1, 10 - a different word - has nearly the same meaning. The Messiah will be a fresh sprout from the stump of a tree that has been felled; i.e. from the destroyed Davidic monarchy. As a root (so Isaiah 11:10; Revelation 5:5). The \"sapling\" from the house of David shall become the \"root\" out of which his Church will grow (comp. John 15:1-6). Out of a dry ground. Either out of the \"dry ground\" of a corrupt age and nation, or out of the arid soil of humanity. In the East it is not unusual to see a tall succulent plant growing from a soft which seems utterly devoid of moisture. Such plants have roots that strike deep, and draw their nourishment from a hidden source. He hath no form nor comeliness; rather, he had no form nor majesty. It is scarcely the prophet's intention to describe the personal appearance of our Lord. What he means is that \"the Servant\" would have no splendid surroundings, no regal pomp nor splendour - nothing about him to attract men's eyes, or make them think him anything extraordinary. It is impossible to suppose that there was not in his appearance something of winning grace and quiet majesty. but it was of a kind that was not adapted to draw the gaze of the multitude. And when we shall see him. Some connect this clause with the preceding, and translate, \"He hath no form nor comeliness, that we should regard him; no beauty, that we should desire him\" (Lowth, Vitringa, Gesenius, Ewald, Knobel, Henderson, Urwick. But Stier, Delitzsch, Kay, and Mr. Cheyne prefer the construction found in the Authorized Version). No beauty; literally, no sightliness; i.e. nothing to attract the eye or arrest it. The spiritual beauties of holy and sweet expression and majestic calm could only have ben spiritually discerned.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah53:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHe is despised and rejected of men; a man of sorrows, and acquainted with grief: and we hid as it were our faces from him; he was despised, and we esteemed him not.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 3. - He is despised; rather, was despised (comp. Isaiah 49:7 and Psalm 22:6). Men's contempt was shown, partly in the little attention which they paid to his teaching, partly in their treatment of him on the night and day before the Crucifixion (Matthew 26:67, 68; Matthew 27:29-31; Mark 14:65; Mark 15:18, 19, etc.). Rejected of men; rather, perhaps, forsaken of men - \"one from whom men held themselves aloof\" (Cheyne); comp. Job 19:14. Our Lord had at no time more than a \"little flock\" attached to him. Of these, after a time, \"many went back, and walked no more with him\" (John 6:66). Some, who believed on him, would only come to him by night (John 3:2). All the \"rulers\" and great men held aloof from him (John 7:48). At the end, even his apostles \"forsook him, and fled\" (Matthew 26:56). A Man of sorrows. The word translated \"sorrows\" means also pains of any kind. But the beautiful rendering of our version may well stand, since there are many places where the word used certainly means \"sorrow\" and nothing else (see Exodus 3:7; 2 Chronicles 6:29; Psalm 32:10; Psalm 38:17; Ecclesiastes 1:18; Jeremiah 30:15; Jeremiah 45:3; Lamentations 1:12, 18, etc.). Aquila well translates, ἄνδρα ἀλγηδόνων The \"sorrows\" of Jesus appear on every page of the Gospels. Acquainted with grief; literally, with sickness; but as aeger and aegritudo are applied in Latin both to the mind and to the body, so kholi, the word here used, would seem to be in Hebrew (see Jeremiah 6:7; Jeremiah 10:19). The translation of the Authorized Version may therefore be retained. We hid as it were our faces from him; literally, and there was as it were the hiding of the face from him. Some suppose the hiding of God's face to be intended; but the context, which describes the treatment of the Servant by his fellow-men, makes the meaning given in our version far preferable. Men turned their faces from him when they met him, would not see him, would not recognize him (comp. Job 19:13-17; Job 30:10). Despised. A repetition very characteristic of Isaiah (see Isaiah 1:7; Isaiah 3:12; Isaiah 4:3; Isaiah 6:11; Isaiah 14:25; Isaiah 15:8; Isaiah 17:12, 13, etc.).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah53:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTSurely he hath borne our griefs, and carried our sorrows: yet we did esteem him stricken, smitten of God, and afflicted.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 4. - Surely he hath borne our griefs; or, surely they were our griefs which he bore. The pronouns are emphatic. Having set forth at length the fact of the Servant's humiliation (vers. 2, 3), the prophet hastens to declare the reason of it. Twelve times over within the space of nine verses he asserts. with the most emphatic reiteration, that all the Servant's sufferings were vicarious, borne for him, to save him from the consequences of his sins, to enable him to escape punishment. The doctrine thus taught in the Old Testament is set forth! with equal distinctness in the New (Matthew 20:28; John 11:50-52; Romans 3:25; Romans 5:6-8; Romans 8:3; 2 Corinthians 5:18-21; 2 Corinthians 8:9; Galatians 3:13; Ephesians 1:7; 1 Peter 2:24, etc.), and forms the hope, the trust, and the consolation of Christians. and carried our sorrows. The application which St. Matthew makes of this passage to our Lord's miracles of healing (Matthew 8:17) is certainly not the primary sense of the words, but may be regarded as a secondary application of them. Christ's sufferings were the remedy for all the ills that flesh is heir to. Yet we did esteem him stricken, smitten of God. They who saw Christ suffer, instead of understanding that he was bearing the sins of others in a mediatorial capacity, imagined that he was suffering at God's hands for his own sins. Hence they scoffed at him and reviled him, even in his greatest agonies (Matthew 27:39-44). To one only, and him not one of God's people, was it given to see the contrary, and to declare aloud, at the moment of the death, \"Certainly this was a righteous Man\" (Luke 23:47).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah53:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut he was wounded for our transgressions, he was bruised for our iniquities: the chastisement of our peace was upon him; and with his stripes we are healed.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 5. - But he was wounded for our transgressions. This verse contains four asseverations of the great truth that all Christ's sufferings were for us, and constituted the atonement for our sins. The form is varied, but the truth is one. Christ was \"wounded\" or \"pierced\"NEWLINENEWLINE(1) by the thorns;NEWLINENEWLINE(2) by the nails; andNEWLINENEWLINE(3) by the spear of the soldier.NEWLINENEWLINEThe wounds inflicted by the nails caused his death, He was bruised; or, crushed (comp. Isaiah 3:15; Isaiah 19:10; Isaiah 57:15. Psalm 72:4). \"No stronger expression could be found in Hebrew to denote severity of suffering - suffering unto death\" (Urwick). The chastisement of our peace was upon him; i.e. \"the chastisement which brought us peace,\" which put a stop to the enmity between fallen man and an offended God - which made them once more at one (comp. Ephesians 2:15-17, \"Having abolished in his flesh the enmity, even the Law of commandments contained in ordinances; for to make in himself of twain one new man, so making peace; and that he might reconcile both unto God in one body by the cross, having slain the enmity thereby: and came and preached peace to you which were afar off;\" Colossians 1:20, \"Having made peace through the blood of his cross, by him to reconcile all things unto himself\"). With his stripes we are healed; rather, we were healed (comp. 1 Peter 2:24, \"By whose stripes ye were healed\"). Besides the blows inflicted on him with the hand (Matthew 26:27) and with the reed (Matthew 27:30), our Lord was judicially scourged (Matthew 27:26). Such scourging would leave the \"stripe-marks\" which are here spoken of.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah53:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAll we like sheep have gone astray; we have turned every one to his own way; and the LORD hath laid on him the iniquity of us all.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 6. - All we like sheep have gone astray. \"All we\" means either the whole nation of Israel, which \"went astray\" in the wilderness of sin (Psalm 107:4; Psalm 119:176; Ezekiel 34:6), or else the whole race of mankind, which had wandered from the right path, and needed atonement and redemption even more than Israel itself We have turned every one to his own way. Collectively and individually, the whole world had sinned. There was \"none that did good\" absolutely - \"no, not one\" (Psalm 14:3). All had quitted \"the way of the Lord\" (Isaiah 40:3) to walk in their \"own ways\" (Isaiah 66:3). The Lord hath laid on him; literally, the Lord caused to light upon him. God the Father, as the primary Disposer of all things, lays upon the Son the burden, which the Son voluntarily accepts. He comes into the world to do the Father's will. He prays to the Father, \"Let this cup pass from me: nevertheless not as I will, but as thou wilt\" (Matthew 26:39). So St. John says that the Father \"sent the Son to be the Propitiation for our sins\" (1 John 4:10). And St. Paul tells us that God (the Father) \"made him to be sin for us who knew no sin\" (2 Corinthians 5:21). It does not lessen the Son's exceeding mercy and loving-kindness in accepting the burden, that it was laid upon him by the Father. The iniquity of us all (compare the initial \"All we\"). The redemption is as universal as the sin, at any rate potentially. Christ on the cross made \"a full, perfect, and sufficient sacrifice... for the sins of the whole world.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah53:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHe was oppressed, and he was afflicted, yet he opened not his mouth: he is brought as a lamb to the slaughter, and as a sheep before her shearers is dumb, so he openeth not his mouth.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 7. - He was oppressed. As Israel under the Egyptian taskmasters (Exodus 3:7). The cruel ill usage in the high priest's house, and before Herod is, perhaps, specially pointed at. He was afflicted; rather, he abased himself (comp. Isaiah 31:4 and Exodus 10:3). The position of the emphatic pronoun (hu) between the first participle and the second detaches the second clause from the first and conjoins it with the third. Otherwise the rendering of the Authorized Version might stand. Translate, He was oppressed, but he abased himself and opened not his mouth. The silence of Jesus before his judges (Matthew 26:62, 63; Matthew 27:14), when he could so easily have vindicated himself from every charge, was a self-abasement. It seemed like an admission of guilt. He opened not his mouth (comp. Psalm 38:13, 14; Psalm 39:2, 9). The contrast of the Servant's silence and passivity with men's ordinary vehemence of self-assertion under ill usage is most striking. Who was ever silent but he under such extremity of provocation? (For a contrast, see the account of the Jewish martyrdoms in 2 Macc. 7.) He is brought as a lamb; rather, as the lamb. The Paschal lamb is, perhaps, intended, or, at any rate, the lamb of sacrifice. The prophet has often seen the dumb, innocent lamb led in silence to the altar, to be slain there, and thinks of that touching sight. It was probably the use of this imagery here which caused the Baptist to term our Lord \"the Lamb of God, which taketh away the sin of the world\" (John 1:29). As a sheep before her shearers. A second image, a reflex of the first, somewhat weaker, as so often in Isaiah (Isaiah 1:22, 30; Isaiah 5:18, 24; Isaiah 8:14; Isaiah 10:24, 27, 34; Isaiah 11:8; Isaiah 13:14; Isaiah 24:13; Isaiah 25:7, etc.).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah53:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHe was taken from prison and from judgment: and who shall declare his generation? for he was cut off out of the land of the living: for the transgression of my people was he stricken.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 8. - He was taken from prison and from judgment; rather, by oppression and a judgment was he taken away; i.e. (us Dr. Kay says) \"by a violence which cloaked itself under the formalities of a legal process.\" The Septuagint Version, which is quoted by Philip the deacon in the Acts (Isaiah 8:33), must have been derived from quite a different text. It preserves, however, the right rendering of the verb, \"was he taken away,\" i.e. removed from the earth. Who shall declare his generation? literally, his generation who considereth? The meaning is obscure. Dr. Kay understands by \"his generation,\" his lifetime or his life, comparing Isaiah 38:12, \"Mine age is departed,\" where the same word is used and accompanied by a pronominal suffix. Mr. Urwick suggests that it includesNEWLINENEWLINE(1) his origin;NEWLINENEWLINE(2) his earthly life; andNEWLINENEWLINE(3) his everlasting reign in heaven.NEWLINENEWLINEOthers (Delitzsch, Gesenius, Cheyne) take \"his generation\" to mean \"the men of his generation,\" and join the clause with what follows: \"As for those of his generation, which of them considered that he was cut off,\" etc.? He was cut off; i.e. taken away before his time, cut down like a flower (comp. Job 14:2; Lamentations 3:54; Ezekiel 37:11). The land of the living. The present world, the earth (see Isaiah 38:11; and comp. Job 28:13; Psalm 27:13; Psalm 52:5; Psalm 116:9; Psalm 142:2; Jeremiah 11:19). For the transgression of my people was he stricken. The sentiment is the same as in ver. 5, but with the difference that there it was suffering only, here it is death itself, which the Servant endures for man. \"My people\" may be either \"God's people\" or \"the prophet's people,\" according as the speaker is regarded as Isaiah or Jehovah. Jehovah certainly becomes the Speaker in vers. 11, 12.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah53:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he made his grave with the wicked, and with the rich in his death; because he had done no violence, neither was any deceit in his mouth.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 9. - And he made his grave with the wicked; rather, they assigned him his grave with the wicked. The verb is used impersonally. Those who condemned Christ to be crucified with two malefactors on the common execution-ground - \"the place of a skull\" - meant his grave to be \"with the wicked,\" with whom it would naturally have been but for the interference of Joseph of Arimathaea. Crucified persons were buried with their crosses near the scene of their crucifixion by the Romans. And with the rich in his death; or, and (he was) with a rich one after his death. In the preceding clause, the word translated \"the wicked\" is plural, but in the present, the word translated \"the rich\" is singular. The expression translated \"in his death\" means \"when he was dead,\" \"after death\" (comp. 1 Kings 13:31; Psalm 6:5). The words have a singularly exact fulfilment in the interment of our Lord (Matthew 27:57-60). Because. The preposition used may mean either \"because\" or \"although.\" The ambiguity is, perhaps, intentional. He had done no violence; or, no wrong (see Genesis 16:5; 1 Chronicles 12:17; Job 19:7; Psalm 35:11 (margin); Proverbs 26:6). The LXX. give ἀνομία while St. Peter renders the word used by ἀμαρτία (1 Peter 2:22). The sinlessness of Christ is asserted by himself (John 8:46), and forms the main argument in the Epistle to the Hebrews for the superiority of the new covenant over the old (Hebrews 7:26-28; Hebrews 9:14). It is also witnessed to by St. Peter (1 Peter 2:22), by St. Paul (2 Corinthians 5:21), and by St. John (1 John 3:5). As no other man was ever without sin, it follows that the Servant of the present chapter must be Jesus.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah53:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTYet it pleased the LORD to bruise him; he hath put him to grief: when thou shalt make his soul an offering for sin, he shall see his seed, he shall prolong his days, and the pleasure of the LORD shall prosper in his hand.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 10. - Yet it pleased the Lord to bruise him (see the comment on ver. 6, ad fin.). The sufferings of Christ, proceeding from the \"determinate counsel and foreknowledge of God\" (Acts 2:23), and being permitted by him; were in some sort his doing. It \"pleased him,\" moreover, that they should be undergone, for he saw with satisfaction the Son's self-sacrifice, and he witnessed with joy man's redemption and deliverance effected thereby. He hath put him to grief; rather, he dealt grievously - a sort of hend-adys. \"He bruised him with a grievous bruising.\" When thou shalt make his soul an offering for sin. It is proposed (Ewald, Cheyne), by the alteration of a letter, to make the passage run thus: \"When he shall make his soul an offering,\" etc., and argued that \"he who offers the Servant's life as a sacrifice must be the Servant himself, and not Jehovah\" (Cheyne). No doubt the Servant did offer his own life (see Matthew 20:28,\" He gave his soul a ransom for many\"); but that fact does not preclude the possibility of the Father having also offered it. \"Believest thou not,\" said our Lord to Philip, \"that I am in the Father, and the Father in me? The words that I speak unto you I speak not of myself: but the Father that dwelleth in me, he doeth the works\" (John 14:10). This perienchoresis, as the ancient theologians called it, makes it possible to predicate of the Father almost all the actions which can be predicated of the Son - all, in fact, excepting those which belong to the Son's humanity, or which involve obedience and subordination. As the Father had \"laid on Christ the iniquity of us all\" (ver. 6), as he had \"bruised him and put him to grief,\" so he might be said to have \"made his soul an offering for sin.\" All was settled in the Divine counsels from all eternity, and when the ideal became the actual, God the Father wrought with God the Son to effectuate it. \"Offerings for sin,\" or \"guilt offerings,\" were distinct from \"sin offerings.\" The object of the former was \"satisfaction,\" of the latter \"expiation.\" The Servant of Jehovah was, however, to be both. \"As in ver. 5 the Divine Servant is represented as a Sin Offering, his death being an expiation, so here he is described as a Guilt Offering, his death being a satisfaction\" (Urwick, 'The Servant of Jehovah,' p. 151). He shall see his seed. The \"seed\" of a teacher of religion are his disciples. St. Paul speaks of Onesimus as one whom he had \"begotten in his bends\" (Philemon 1:10). He calls himself by implication the \"father\" of his Corinthian converts (1 Corinthians 4:15). Both he and St. John address their disciples as \"little children\" (Galatians 4:19; 1 John 2:1, 18, 25 I:3:7, 18 I:4:4 I:5:21). It had long previously been promised that \"a seed should serve\" Messiah (Psalm 22:30). Our Lord himself occasionally called his disciples his \"children\" (Mark 10:24; John 21:5). He has always \"seen his seed\" in his true followers. He shall prolong his days. A seeming contradiction to the statement (ver. 8) that he should be \"cut off\" out of the land of the living; and the more surprising because his death is made the condition of this long life: \"When thou shalt make his soul an offering [or, 'sacrifice'] for sin,\" then \"he shall prolong his days.\" But the resurrection of Christ, and his entrance upon an immortal life (Romans 6:9), after offering himself as a Sacrifice upon the cross, exactly meets the difficulty and solves the riddle (comp. Revelation 1:18). The pleasure of the Lord shall prosper in his hand. \"In his hand\" means \"by his instrumentality.\" The \"pleasure of the Lord\" is God's ultimate aim and end with respect to his universe. This would \"prosper\" - i.e. be advanced, wrought out, rendered effectual - by the instrumentality of Christ. \"Taking the verse as a whole, it sets forthNEWLINENEWLINE(1) the origin,NEWLINENEWLINE(2) the nature, andNEWLINENEWLINE(3) the result of the Saviour's sufferings.NEWLINENEWLINETaking the last clause by itself, we haveNEWLINENEWLINE(1) the Divine complacency in the purpose of human salvation; andNEWLINENEWLINE(2) the successful issue of that purpose as administered by the Messiah\" (Urwick, 'The Servant of Jehovah,' p. 153).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah53:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHe shall see of the travail of his soul, and shall be satisfied: by his knowledge shall my righteous servant justify many; for he shall bear their iniquities.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 11. - He shall see of the travail of his soul, and shall be satisfied; rather, because of the travail of his soul he shall see, and be satisfied (comp. Philippians 2:7-11, \"He made himself of no reputation, and took upon him the form of a servant, and was made in the likeness of men; and being found in fashion as a man, he humbled himself, and became obedient unto death, even the death of the cross, Wherefore God also hath highly exalted him, and given him a Name which is above every name: that at the Name of Jesus every knee should bow, of things in heaven, and things in earth, and things under the earth; and that every tongue should confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father\"). No cross - no crown. First, suffering, then glory. Because Christ suffered, and was bruised, and put to grief, and made a sacrifice for sin; because of all this \"travail of his soul,\" - therefore it was given him to see the happy results of his sufferings - the formation of that Church which will live with him for ever in heaven (Revelation 7:4-17), and therewith to be \"satisfied.\" By his knowledge shall my righteous servant justify many; i.e. \"by his knowledge of the Divine counsels and purpose, which he will impart to his disciples, shall my righteous Servant justify many\" (literally, the many), or, in other words, \"turn them from sin to righteousness\" (comp. Daniel 12:3). Nothing is so effectual in turning men to righteousness as teaching them the true knowledge of God - his nature, his purposes with regard to them, his feelings towards them. Christ, from his own knowledge, gave men this knowledge, and so did all that could be done to draw them to his Father. And his efforts were not without result. The fruit of his teaching has been the justification of many - ay, of \"the many,\" as both Isaiah and St. Paul (Romans 5:19) testify. For he shall bear their iniquities; rather, and their iniquities he himself shall bear. The initial part of the clause is not \"causal,\" but merely connective. There are two main things which Christ does for his people - he makes them righteous by infusing into them of his own righteousness; and he bears the burden of their iniquities, taking them upon himself, and by his perpetual intercession obtaining God's forgiveness of them. As Delitzsch says, \"His continued taking of our trespasses upon himself is merely the constant presence and presentation of his atonement, which has been offered once for all. The dead yet living One, because of his one self-sacrifice, is an eternal Priest, who now lives to distribute the blessings which he has acquired\" ('Commentary on Isaiah,' vol. 2:p. 338).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah53:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTTherefore will I divide him a portion with the great, and he shall divide the spoil with the strong; because he hath poured out his soul unto death: and he was numbered with the transgressors; and he bare the sin of many, and made intercession for the transgressors.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 12. - Therefore (see the comment on ver. 11, sub init.). Will I divide him a portion with the great; i.e. \"I will place him among the great conquering ones of the earth\" - an accommodation to human modes of thought analogous to the frequent comparison of Christ's kingdom with the kingdoms of the earth (Daniel 2:44; Daniel 7:9-14. etc.). The apostle goes deeper into the true nature of things when he says, \"Therefore also hath God highly exalted him, and given him a Name which is above every name\" (Philippians 2:9). He shall divide the spoil with the strong. A repetition of the thought in the preceding clause (comp. Proverbs 16:19). Because he hath poured out his soul unto death. Christ not only died for man, but, as it were, \"poured out his soul\" with his own hand to the last drop. The expression emphasizes the duration and the voluntariness of Messiah's sufferings. And he was numbered with the transgressors; rather, and he was reckoned with transgressors (see Luke 22:37, Μετὰ ἀνόμων ἐλογίσθη where our Lord applies the words to himself). Christ was condemned as a \"blasphemer\" (Matthew 26:65), crucified with malefactors (Luke 23:32), called \"that deceiver\" (Matthew 27:63), and regarded generally by the Jews as accursed (Deuteronomy 21:23). And he bare the sin of many; rather, and himself bare the sin of many (compare the last clauses of vers. 6 and 11; and see also Hebrews 9:27). And made intercession for the transgressors. The future is used, with van conversive, instead of the preterite, to mark that the act, though begun in the past, is inchoate only, and not completed. The \"intercession for transgressors\" was begun upon the cross with the compassionate words, \"Father, forgive them; for they know not what they do\" (Luke 23:34). But it has continued ever since, and will continue until the last day (see Romans 8:34; Hebrews 7:25).NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINE","Isa.54":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah54:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTSing, O barren, thou that didst not bear; break forth into singing, and cry aloud, thou that didst not travail with child: for more are the children of the desolate than the children of the married wife, saith the LORD.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 1-10. - A PROMISE TO ISRAEL OF GREAT INCREASE, AND OF GOD'S PERSISTENT PROTECTION. There is no close connection between this chapter and the last, or even between this section and the preceding. Vers. 1-5 take up the thought of Isaiah 49:19-21, and expand it. Israel is assured of a great enlargement of her numbers, and bidden to rejoice thereat. She is then further comforted with a promise that she shall never be forsaken (vers. 6-10). Verse 1. - Sing, O barren. Israel in captivity is addressed as \"barren,\" because, in the time of suffering, her numbers rather diminished than increased. Still, she is bidden to \"sing\" on account of the prospect that is opening upon her. She that is now desolate and solitary will soon have more children than she formerly had, when she was a married wife, enjoying the fellowship of Jehovah, her Husband (ver. 5). The \"children\" spoken of are in part those who gathered themselves together in Jerusalem and the adjacent territory after the issue of the decree of Cyrus (1 Chronicles 9:2-34; Ezra 2:1-65; Ezra 8:1-20; Nehemiah 7:6-72; Nehemiah 11:3-36), but mainly such as flocked in from the Gentiles, both before and after Christ's coming (see ver. 3).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah54:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTEnlarge the place of thy tent, and let them stretch forth the curtains of thine habitations: spare not, lengthen thy cords, and strengthen thy stakes;VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 2. - Enlarge the place of thy tent (comp.

Israel will have so many more children that her \"tent\" will need enlarging. The curtains; i.e. the tent-cloth (comp. Exodus 26 and 36, where the word used occurs repeatedly). Thy cords... thy stakes (comp. Exodus 35:18; Exodus 39:40, etc.). The ropes and tent-pegs, which kept the tent-cloth in place, are intended. The enlargement of the tent would make longer ropes and larger pegs necessary.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah54:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor thou shalt break forth on the right hand and on the left; and thy seed shall inherit the Gentiles, and make the desolate cities to be inhabited.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 3. - For thou shalt break forth; or, thou shalt increase (see Genesis 30:30, 43; Exodus 1:12). An overflow, like that of the bursting out of water, is pointed at. On the right hand and on the left; i.e. \"on all sides\" (comp. Genesis 28:14). Thy seed shall inherit the Gentiles. The Christian Church is viewed as a continuation of the Jewish Church; and the conversion of nation after nation to the gospel is regarded as the extension of Jewish dominion over fresh lands. The cities of these lands - desolate hitherto, i.e. without godly inhabitants - will under these circumstances come to be inhabited; i.e. will be peopled by faithful men.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah54:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFear not; for thou shalt not be ashamed: neither be thou confounded; for thou shalt not be put to shame: for thou shalt forget the shame of thy youth, and shalt not remember the reproach of thy widowhood any more.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 4. - Thou shalt forget the shame of thy youth; rather, of thy maidenhood; i.e. of the time when thou wert a maiden, before by the covenant of Sinai Jehowth became thy Husband (ver. 5). The \"shame\" of this period was 'the Egyptian bondage. Israel's later condition would be such that the very recollection of this bondage would fade away and cease. The reproach of thy widowhood. Israel became a \"widow\" when Jehovah withdrew his presence from her, when the Shechinah disappeared from the temple, and the temple itself was destroyed, and Jerusalem was a desolation, and the people captives in a far land. The special \"reproach of her widowhood\" was the Babylonian captivity, with the sins that had brought it about. This too would be forgotten in the good time to come, amid the glories of the Messianic kingdom.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah54:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor thy Maker is thine husband; the LORD of hosts is his name; and thy Redeemer the Holy One of Israel; The God of the whole earth shall he be called.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 5. - For thy Maker is thine Husband; rather, for thy Husband is thy Maker. The verse is exegetical of the terms, \"married with\" in ver. 1, and \"widowhood\" in ver. 4. \"I,\" says the prophet, \"have called thee married and widowed, thereby yoking thee to a husband, for thou hast a Husband, namely, thy Maker.\" (The Hebrew has both words in the plural, to accord with the following Elohim.) This relationship of God to his Church is often asserted by the prophets (Jeremiah 3:14; Jeremiah 31:32; Hosea 2:19; Song of Solomon 1:4, etc.), and lies at the root of the oft-recurring metaphor by which idolatry is called \"lewdness,\" \"adultery,\" or \"playing the whore.\" Thy Redeemer the Holy One; rather, thy Redeemer is the Holy One. (On the title itself, see the comment on Isaiah 1:4.) The God of the whole earth (comp. Psalm 24:1; Psalm 47:2, 7; Psalm 133:18, etc.). Materially, he was always this. Now, from this time, he will be \"God of the whole earth\" morally; not God of the Jews only, but also of the Gentiles (see Romans 3:29).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah54:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor the LORD hath called thee as a woman forsaken and grieved in spirit, and a wife of youth, when thou wast refused, saith thy God.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 6. - For the Lord hath called thee; i.e. recalled thee to himself - summoned thee to return, and once more resume the office of a wife. As a woman forsaken and grieved in spirit; i.e. as one whom her husband has cast off, and whose spirit is grieved by the repudiation. No doubt a large number of the captives had the same spirit of penitence as Daniel (Daniel 9:5-19). A wife of youth. One wooed and won in youth, therefore more dearly loved, more regretfully repudiated, more joyfully restored when seen to be penitent. When thou wast refused; rather, when she has been cast off. Jehovah takes back Israel into the old relationship, as a man takes back \"the wife of his youth,\" when she has been for a long time \"cast off.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah54:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor a small moment have I forsaken thee; but with great mercies will I gather thee.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 7, 8. - For a small moment have I forsaken thee. The sixty or seventy years of the Captivity were but as a moment of time compared with the long ages during which God had tenderly watched over and protected his Church, and, still more, compared with the eternity during which he was now about to show himself her constant Guardian and Protector. There had been a little wrath; or rather, one burst of wrath; and then Mercy had resumed her sway. The face hid for a moment had been allowed once more to shine upon the afflicted people; and the momentary indignation would be followed by, and swallowed up in, ever-lasting kindness (compare above, Isaiah 26:20 and Psalm 30:5, \"His anger endureth but a moment; in his favour is life: weeping may endure for a night, but joy cometh in the morning\").NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah54:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTIn a little wrath I hid my face from thee for a moment; but with everlasting kindness will I have mercy on thee, saith the LORD thy Redeemer.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah54:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor this is as the waters of Noah unto me: for as I have sworn that the waters of Noah should no more go over the earth; so have I sworn that I would not be wroth with thee, nor rebuke thee.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 9. - This is as the waters of Noah unto me. The existing calamity - Israel submerged in the flood of Babylonian captivity-is as it were a repetition of the calamity of the Deluge in God's eyes. Its object is to purify his Church, as the object of the Flood was to purify the world. A righteous household survived in the one case; a righteous remnant would go forth in the other. And as God bound himself in Noah's time not to repeat the calamity of the Deluge, so now he binds himself not again to submerge his Church in a captivity like the Babylonian. It has been said that the promise was not kept, since the Jewish Church was, in A.D. , carried captive by the Romans. But the prophet views the Jewish Church as continued in the Christian, into which all its better and more spiritual members passed at the first preaching of the gospel; and the promise here made is thus parallel to that of our Lord, \"Upon this rock I will build my Church; and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it\" (Matthew 16:18). Much as the Christian Church has suffered from the world, it has never been in like cases with the Jewish Church in Babylon, and, as God is faithful, never will be reduced to such extremity. As I have sworn; i.e. \"pledged myself.\" It does not appear from Genesis 8:20-22 or Genesis 9:8-17 that God actually bound himself by oath. So have I sworn that I would not be wroth with thee, nor rebuke thee. That is to say, not to the same extent, not so as to visit her with the same punishment.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah54:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor the mountains shall depart, and the hills be removed; but my kindness shall not depart from thee, neither shall the covenant of my peace be removed, saith the LORD that hath mercy on thee.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 10. - The mountains shall depart... but my kindness shall not depart (comp. Matthew 24:35, \"Heaven and earth shall pass away, but my words shall not pass away\"). Everything material may fail, depart, perish; but God's promises remain firm and secure for ever. The covenant of my peace; or, my covenant of peace - any promise which God makes to his creatures for their advantage (comp. Numbers 25:12; Ezekiel 34:25; Ezekiel 37:26; Malachi 2:5). Here there is a special allusion to the promise just made and confirmed by oath (ver. 9).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah54:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTO thou afflicted, tossed with tempest, and not comforted, behold, I will lay thy stones with fair colours, and lay thy foundations with sapphires.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 11-17. - THE GLORY OF THE NEW JERUSALEM, AND THE HAPPINESS OF ITS INHABITANTS. Hitherto Israel has been addressed; now the direct object of address is Jerusalem. The eye of the prophet passes, however, with a glance, from the actual present to the far-distant future, and sees the Zion of God in her heavenly setting, all bedecked with precious stones, as she was seen by the exile of Patmos more than seven centuries later (Revelation 21:16-21). After briefly describing the heavenly city, he passes to her inhabitants, and promises them peace, protection, and righteousness. Verse 11. - O thou afflicted (comp. Isaiah 49:14-17). Jerusalem is seen as she was during the Captivity - \"afflicted\" by God's hand, vexed with all his storms, and not yet comforted (Comp. Isaiah 64:10, 11). Then a fresh vision obliterates the mournful sight. I will lay thy stones with fair colours; literally, I will lay thy stones in antimony; i.e. I will give them a setting and adornment like that which beautiful women were in the habit of giving to their eyes when they wished to attract admiration (see 2 Kings 9:30). Puk, or antimony, was used to stain both the upper and the under eyelid, in order to increase the apparent lustre of the eye, and so impart to it greater beauty. The passage is not to be understood as implying that coloured marbles were ever really set in antimony. And lay thy foundations with sapphires; or, make thy foundations of sapphires. In Revelation the first foundation is \"jasper,\" the second \"sapphire\" (Revelation 21:19). Sapphire was the foundation on which the throne of God appeared to be set, when it was seen by Moses, Aaron, and the seventy elders (Exodus 24:10). The throne itself had the appearance of sapphire, as seen by Ezekiel (Ezekiel 1:26; Ezekiel 10:1). Sapphire is the hue of heaven.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah54:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd I will make thy windows of agates, and thy gates of carbuncles, and all thy borders of pleasant stones.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 12. - I will make thy windows of agates. Most moderns translate, \"I will make thy battlements,\" or \"thy pinnacles of rubies.\" The exact meaning is very doubtful. Thy gates of carbuncles. In the Revelation of St. John the gates are each of them composed of one pearl (Revelation 21:21) - the pearl betokening purity, the carbuncle the glow of devotional feeling. We must not expect consistency in descriptions which are entirely allegorical. All thy borders of pleasant stones; or, all thy boundaries. An enclosing wall seems to be meant (comp. Revelation 21:17).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah54:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd all thy children shall be taught of the LORD; and great shall be the peace of thy children.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 13. - All thy children shall be taught of the Lord (comp. Isaiah 44:3; Jeremiah 31:33, 34; Ezekiel 11:19; Joel 2:28; Acts 2:17, 18, etc.). Christians are all of them \"taught of God\" (John 6:45 1 Thessalonians 4:9). The \"anointing,\" which they have from the Holy Ghost, \"teaches them, and is truth, and is no lie\" (1 John 2:27), and causes them to \"know all things\" (1 John 2:20). And great shall be the peace of thy children. Messiah was to be \"the Prince of Peace\" (Isaiah 9:6). His birth heralded the coming of \"peace on earth\" (Luke 2:14). So far forth as men are true Christians, does peace reign in the conscience and show itself in the life. Externally there may be persecution, tumult, wars, fightings; but internally, in each heart, there will be a \"peace that passes all understanding\" (Philippians 4:7). God \"keeps in perfect peace\" those\" whose minds are stayed on him\" (Isaiah 26:3).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah54:14VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTIn righteousness shalt thou be established: thou shalt be far from oppression; for thou shalt not fear: and from terror; for it shall not come near thee.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 14. - In righteousness shalt thou be established; rather, through righteousness. \"There is no peace, saith my God, to the wicked\" (Isaiah 48:22); and conversely, where righteousness abounds, peace prevails, and the nation \"is established.\" Thou shalt be far from oppression; rather, be thou far from anxiety (Delitzsch). Thou shalt not fear; rather, thou needest not fear. There is no danger - nothing to be afraid cf. \"They shall not hurt nor destroy in all my holy mountain\" (Isaiah 11:9).

All those who gather together against thee shall fall - i.e. stumble and be overthrown - through striking against thee. The rendering of the Authorized Version, \"for thy sake,\" is quite indefensible.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah54:16VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBehold, I have created the smith that bloweth the coals in the fire, and that bringeth forth an instrument for his work; and I have created the waster to destroy.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 16. - Behold, I have created, etc. The Church is encouraged to fear no danger by being reminded that all power to do hurt is from God. Whether it be the smith that forges a weapon, or the waster that destroys and lays waste whole countries, or any other worker of woe to man, all are equally brought into being, and sustained in life, by God. None can do a hurt that God does not allow. The smith that bloweth the coals. In ancient times the smith worked his metal into shape by the help of a blow-pipe, which he blew himself (see Rosellini, 'Monumenti Civili,' pl. 51, fig 4, and pl. 52, fig. 4). For his work; or, for its work: i.e. destruction.

Whether weapons are used against Israel, or whether she is attacked, as in Sennacherib's time, by \"the tongue that speaketh proud things\" (Isaiah 36:4-20; Isaiah 37:10-13), the result will he the same. She will triumph over her enemies, and condemn them or put them to shame. Her security is her righteousness, which she derives from Jehovah (comp. Isaiah 45:24, 25).NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINE","Isa.55":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah55:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHo, every one that thirsteth, come ye to the waters, and he that hath no money; come ye, buy, and eat; yea, come, buy wine and milk without money and without price.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 1-7. - AN EXHORTATION TO SPIRITUALITY AND REPENTANCE. The prophet passes from the ideal to the actual, from the glorious future to the unsatisfactory present. The people are not ripe for the blessings of the Messianic kingdom - they do not sufficiently value them. Hence a tender exhortation is addressed to them by God himself, inviting them to become more spiritually minded (vers. 1-3), and fresh promises are held out to the obedient (vers. 3-5). The disobedient are then somewhat sternly exhorted to turn from their evil ways and repent (vers. 6, 7). Verse 1. - Ho, every one that thirsteth! Though the mass are gross and carnally minded, there will ever be some who have higher aspirations - who hunger and thirst after righteousness\" (Matthew 5:6), and desire spiritual blessings. These are invited, first of all, to come and partake of the good things provided for them in Messiah's kingdom. Come ye to the waters (on the spiritual symbolism of water, see the homiletics on Isaiah 44:3, 4). Here the \"peace\" and \"righteousness\" of the Messianic kingdom (Isaiah 54:13, 14) are especially intended. Our Lord's cry on the last day of the Feast of Tabernacles (John 7:7) is clearly an echo of this. Wine and milk. These are not symbols of temporal blessings, as many have thought. \"Wine, water, and milk are,\" as Delitzsch says, \"figurative representations of spiritual revival, re-creation, and nourishment.\" Without money and without price. God's spiritual gifts are freely given to men; they cannot be purchased. Being in their own nature \"more precious than rubies,\" their value transcends human means of payment. They cannot even be earned by man's best works; for man's best works are comprised in his duty to God, and have, therefore, no purchasing power. God may choose to reward them; but if he does it is of his free grace.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah55:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWherefore do ye spend money for that which is not bread? and your labour for that which satisfieth not? hearken diligently unto me, and eat ye that which is good, and let your soul delight itself in fatness.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 2. - Wherefore do ye spend money? literally, wherefore do ye weigh silver?-silver being the ordinary currency, and money transactions, in default of a coinage, being by weight (cf. Genesis 23:16; Zechariah 11:12). For that which is not bread; i.e. \"for that which has no real value - which cannot sustain you, which will do you no good.\" The affections of the great mass of the Israelites were set on worldly things, on enriching themselves - adding field to field, and house to house (Isaiah 5:8). They did not care for spiritual blessings, much less \"hunger and thirst\" after them. That which satisfieth not. Worldly things can never satisfy the heart, not even the heart of the worldly. \"What fruit had ye then in those things,\" says St. Paul, \"whereof ye are now ashamed?\" (Romans 6:21). Hearken diligently unto me; rather, hearken, oh, hearken unto me. The phrase is one of earnest exhortation. It implies the strong disinclination of Israel to listen, and seeks to overcome it (compare the opening words of the next verse). Let your soul delight itself in fatness (comp. Psalm 36:8; Psalm 63:5; and Isaiah 25:6). The spiritual blessings of the Messianic kingdom are richer dainties than any that this world has to offer. The soul that obtains them \"delights\" in them, and is satisfied with them (Psalm 17:15).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah55:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTIncline your ear, and come unto me: hear, and your soul shall live; and I will make an everlasting covenant with you, even the sure mercies of David.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 3. - Come unto me (comp. ver. 1, \"Come ye to the waters\"). God dispenses the waters (see Isaiah 44:3). I will make an everlasting covenant with you. That the \"everlasting covenant\" once made between God and man had been broken by man, and by Israel especially, is a part of the teaching contained in the earlier portion of Isaiah (Isaiah 24:5). We find the same asserted in the prophecies of his contemporary, Hosea (Hosea 6:7). It would naturally follow from this that, unless God gave up man altogether, he would enter into a new covenant with him. Accordingly, this new covenant is announced, both in Hosea (Hosea 2:18-20) and in the later chapters of Isaiah, repeatedly (Isaiah 42:6; Isaiah 49:8; Isaiah 54:10; Isaiah 4:3; Isaiah 56:4, 6; Isaiah 59:21; Isaiah 61:8). Having been thus set before the nation, it is further enlarged upon by Jeremiah (Jeremiah 31:31-33; Jeremiah 32:40; Jeremiah 11:5) and Ezekiel (Ezekiel 16:60-62; Ezekiel 34:25; Ezekiel 37:26-28). Almost all commentators allow that the Christian covenant is intended - that \"new covenant\" (Hebrews 9:15) under which man obtains pardon and salvation through the Mediatorship of Christ. Even the sure mercies of David. The \"sure mercies of David\" are the loving and merciful promises which God made to him. These included the promise that the Messiah should come of his seed, and sit on his throne, and establish an everlasting kingdom (Psalm 89:2-5, 19-37), and triumph over death and hell (Psalm 16:9, 10), and give peace and happiness to Israel (Psalm 132:15-18). The promises made to David, rightly understood, involve all the essential points of the Christian covenant.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah55:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBehold, I have given him for a witness to the people, a leader and commander to the people.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 4. - Behold, I have given him for a witness. By ordinary rules of grammar, the pronoun \"him\" should refer to David; and so the passage is understood by Gesenius, Maurer, Hitzig, Ewald, Knobel, Delitzsch, and Mr. Cheyne. But, as Isaiah frequently sets aside ordinary grammatical rules, and as the position to the person here spoken of seems too high for the historical David, a large number of commentators, including Vitringa, Michaelis, Dathe, Rosenmuller, Umbreit, and Dr. Kay, consider that the Messiah is intended. It is certainly difficult to see how the historical David could be, at this time and in the future, a \"leader and commander to the peoples\" who were about to flock into the Messianic kingdom. A witness... a leader and commander. Christ was all these. He \"came to bear witness to the truth\" (John 18:37), and \"before Pilate witnessed a good confession\" (1 Timothy 6:13). He \"feeds and leads\" his people (Revelation 7:17), and is the \"Commander\" under whose banner they serve (2 Timothy 2:3, 4). What he is to his people, he is also of the \"peoples\" generally; for they have been called into his kingdom, People... people; rather, peoples.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah55:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBehold, thou shalt call a nation that thou knowest not, and nations that knew not thee shall run unto thee because of the LORD thy God, and for the Holy One of Israel; for he hath glorified thee.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 5. - Thou shalt call a nation that thou knowest not (comp. Psalm 18:43). The object of address in this verse appears to be the Messiah. He, at his coming, will \"call\" into his kingdom \"a nation,\" or rather, \"people,\" with whom he has had no covenant hitherto; and they will readily and gladly obey the call. Thus God's kingdom will be enlarged, and Israel's glory will be increased, Because of the Lord... for he hath glorified thee. The great cause of the attraction will be the \"glory\" which God the Father has bestowed upon his Son, by raising him from the dead, and exalting him to a seat at his right hand in heaven (Acts 2:32-35; Acts 3:13-15).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah55:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTSeek ye the LORD while he may be found, call ye upon him while he is near:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 6. - Seek ye the Lord. Again the strain changes. The people are once more addressed, but in a tone of reproach. Israel must \"seek the Lord\" without delay, or the opportunity will be past; God will have withdrawn himself from them. He \"will not alway be chiding, neither keepeth he his anger for ever\" (Psalm 103:9).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah55:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTLet the wicked forsake his way, and the unrighteous man his thoughts: and let him return unto the LORD, and he will have mercy upon him; and to our God, for he will abundantly pardon.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 7. - Let the wicked forsake his way; i.e. his mode of life. A general promise of forgiveness of sin upon repentance and amendment of life was first given to Israel through Solomon (2 Chronicles 7:14). The doctrine is largely preached by the prophets; but is nowhere more distinctly and emphatically laid down than in this place. God's will is to \"multiply pardon,\" if man will only turn to him.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah55:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor my thoughts are not your thoughts, neither are your ways my ways, saith the LORD.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 8-13. - A FRESH ASSURANCE or DELIVERANCE FROM BABYLON. Man can scarcely conceive of the deliverance which God designs; but God's thoughts are not as man's (vers. 8, 9). God's word, once pronounced, is potent to effect its purpose (vers. 10, 11). Deliverance from Babylon, having been promised, will take place, and will be accompanied by all manner of spiritual blessings (vers. 12, 13). Verses 8, 9. - My thoughts are not your thoughts. Though man is made in God's image (Genesis 1:27), yet the nature of God in every way infinitely transcends that of man. Both the thoughts and the acts of God surpass man's understanding. Men find it hard to pardon those who have offended them; God can pardon, and \"pardon abundantly.\" Men cannot conceive of coming changes, when they pass certain limits. God knows assuredly what changes are approaching, since they are his doing.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah55:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor as the heavens are higher than the earth, so are my ways higher than your ways, and my thoughts than your thoughts.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah55:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor as the rain cometh down, and the snow from heaven, and returneth not thither, but watereth the earth, and maketh it bring forth and bud, that it may give seed to the sower, and bread to the eater:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 10. - As the rain... and the snow. The rain and the snow are God's ministers (Psalm 148:8), and go forth from him, just as his word does. They have an appointed work to do, and do not return to him, whose ministers they are, until they have done it. It is best to translate, with Delitzsch and Mr. Cheyne, \"As the rain cometh down, and the snow from heaven, and returneth not thither, except it hath watered the earth,\" etc. The writer is, apparently, aware, as the writer of Ecclesiastes is, that the water which falls from heaven in the shape of rain does return thither again in the shape of vapour (see Ecclesiastes 1:7).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah55:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTSo shall my word be that goeth forth out of my mouth: it shall not return unto me void, but it shall accomplish that which I please, and it shall prosper in the thing whereto I sent it.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 11. - So shall my word be. God's word is creative. With the utterance the result is achieved. Hence the sublime passage, which even heathenism could admire (Longin., 'De Sublim.,' § 9), \"And God said, Let there be light: and there was light\" (Genesis 1:3). Hence, too, the more general statement, \"By the Word of the Lord were the heavens made; and all the host of them by the breath of his mouth\" (Psalm 33:6; comp. Psalm 148:5). But it shall accomplish; rather, unless it has accomplished. There is a mixture of two constructions, \"It shall not return void,\" and \"It shall not return unless it has accomplished,\" etc. It shall prosper. Every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God has a prosperous course. It is endued with life from God, and (as Delitzsch says) \"runs like a swift messenger through nature and the world of man, there to melt the ice, as it were, and here to heal and to save; and it does not return from its course till it has given effect to the will of the Sender. \"The special \"word\" which the prophet has here in mind is the promise, so frequently given, of deliverance from Babylon and return in peace and joy to Palestine. But he carries his teaching beyond the immediate occasion, for the benefit of the people of God in all ages.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah55:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor ye shall go out with joy, and be led forth with peace: the mountains and the hills shall break forth before you into singing, and all the trees of the field shall clap their hands.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 12. - Ye shall go out with joy, and be led forth with peace (comp. Isaiah 35:10; Isaiah 40:9-11; Isaiah 43:3-6, 19-21, etc.). A strong contrast is frequently drawn between the exodus from Babylon and that from Egypt. On the former occasion all was hurry, alarm, disquiet, danger. The later exodus will be accompanied with \"peace\" and \"joy\" (see Isaiah 51:9 - 16, etc.). (For the fulfilment, see Ezra 1, 2, and 7, 8.) The mountains and the hills shall break forth before you into singing. All nature shall rejoice at your deliverance, especially the noblest and the grandest parts of nature - \"the mountains and the hills.\" Isaiah's admiration of mountains continually reveals itself throughout the work (Isaiah 5:25; Isaiah 13:2, 4; Isaiah 14:25; Isaiah 22:5; Isaiah 30:17, 25; Isaiah 34:3; Isaiah 40:4, 9, 12; Isaiah 42:11, 15, etc.). It is quite in his manner to speak of nature as bursting forth into singing (Isaiah 35:2; Isaiah 44:23; Isaiah 49:13). All the trees of the field shall clap their hands. The metaphor is not found elsewhere in Isaiah, but appears in Psalm 98:8.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah55:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTInstead of the thorn shall come up the fir tree, and instead of the brier shall come up the myrtle tree: and it shall be to the LORD for a name, for an everlasting sign that shall not be cut off.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 13. - Instead of the thorn shall come up the fir tree. \"Briars and thorns\" were to overgrow the unfruitful vineyard, according to Isaiah 5:6; and to cover the land of God's people, according to Isaiah 32:13. This would be literally the case to a large extent, while the land was allowed to lie waste. The literal meaning is not, however, the whole meaning, or even the main meaning, here. \"Briars and thorns\" represent a general state of wretchedness and sin. The \"fir\" and \"myrtle\" represent a happy external condition of life, in which men \"do righteously.\" It shall be to the Lord for a name. This \"regenerated creation\" will show forth the glory of God to mankind at large, and \"get him a name\" among them (comp. Isaiah 63:12; Jeremiah 13:11). For an everlasting sign. It will also he to God himself an enduring sign of the covenant of peace which he has made with his people, not to hide his face from them any more, but to have mercy on them \"with everlasting kindness\" (Isaiah 54:7-10).NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINE","Isa.56":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah56:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThus saith the LORD, Keep ye judgment, and do justice: for my salvation is near to come, and my righteousness to be revealed.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 1-8. - AN EXHORTATION TO OBSERVE THE LAW, ESPECIALLY THE LAW OF THE SABBATH, COMBINED WITH PROMISES. There was much of the Law which it was impossible to observe during the Captivity. Sacrifice had ceased, the temple was destroyed, almost all the ceremonial law must have been suspended; even the command to do no work on the sabbath day cannot have been kept by a nation of slaves, whose masters would certainly not have permitted them to be idle one day in seven. Still, the spirit of the ordinance might be kept by devoting the day, so far as was possible, to religious observance, as to prayer and to meditation upon holy things. This is now enjoined on the captive Jews, with the promise of a blessing - a blessing in which even the most despised part of the nation, the proselytes and the eunuchs, might participate. Verse 1. - Keep ye judgment, and do justice; rather, keep ye Law, and observe righteousness. The exhortation is general, and has no special bearing on trials or law-courts. It is a call on the Jews, in their captivity, to keep, so far as was possible, the whole Law given on Sinai. My salvation is near to come. The nearer the time of deliverance approaches, the more faithful and exact ought Israel to be in life and conduct. God's \"salvation\" and his \"righteousness\" go hand-in-hand. It is as his righteous people, \"a holy seed\" (Isaiah 6:10), that he is about to vindicate and rescue them. If they are no holier than others, why should he do more for them than for those others?NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah56:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBlessed is the man that doeth this, and the son of man that layeth hold on it; that keepeth the sabbath from polluting it, and keepeth his hand from doing any evil.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 2. - That doeth this... that layeth hold on it; i.e. that doeth according to the exhortation in ver. 1. That keepeth the sabbath. The prominent place assigned to this duty by the evangelical prophet is remarkable. We may observe, however,NEWLINENEWLINE(1) that the spirit of obedience is better tested by a positive than by a moral ordinance; andNEWLINENEWLINE(2) that as, probably, there could be little outward keeping of the sabbath by the captives, it would have had to be kept inwardly by spiritual exercises, by silent prayer and praise, together with prolonged meditation upon holy things. In the absence of all the ordinary aids to devotion, the religious condition of the people must have depended very much on their keeping up the recollection of the sabbath, and hallowing it so far as was possible; e.g. doing no work for themselves, neither buying nor selling, making their devotions longer, and keeping God in their thoughts throughout the day.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah56:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTNeither let the son of the stranger, that hath joined himself to the LORD, speak, saying, The LORD hath utterly separated me from his people: neither let the eunuch say, Behold, I am a dry tree.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 3. - The son of the stranger; i.e. the foreigner, who has become a proselyte. During the depression of the Captivity these are not likely to have been many. Still, there were doubtless some; and these, who had embraced Judaism under such unfavourable circumstances, were entitled to special consideration. As Messianic hopes prevailed, and the time of restoration to Palestine drew near (ver. 1), they might naturally be afraid that they would not be looked upon as equals by the native Israelites, but would be made into a lower grade, if not even excluded. The Lord hath utterly separated me; rather, the Lord will utterly separate me. They do not suppose it done, but think it will be done. The eunuch. Isaiah had prophesied to Hezekiah that a certain number of his seed should serve as eunuchs in the royal palace of the King of Babylon (2 Kings 20:18). Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah were such persons (Daniel 1:3-6), and there may have been others. By the letter of the Law (Deuteronomy 23:1), they were cut off from the congregation, but practically it would seem that during the Captivity they were on a par with other Israelites. These persons feared, with more reason than the foreign proselytes, that, on the return of Israel to their own land, a stricter practice would be established than had prevailed during the Captivity, and the letter of the Law would be enforced against them. I am a dry tree. Therefore useless, and entitled to no consideration at all.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah56:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor thus saith the LORD unto the eunuchs that keep my sabbaths, and choose the things that please me, and take hold of my covenant;VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 4. - The eunuchs that... take hold of my covenant.

Within my walls. Within the walls of my \"holy city\" (see above, Isaiah 54:11, 12; 50:14; 42:12). A place and a name; or, a memorial and a name; i.e. honourable mention, like that promised to the woman who anointed Christ for his burial (Matthew 26:13). Such mention is found in Matthew 19:12; Acts 8:27-39.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah56:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAlso the sons of the stranger, that join themselves to the LORD, to serve him, and to love the name of the LORD, to be his servants, every one that keepeth the sabbath from polluting it, and taketh hold of my covenant;VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 6. - Also the sons of the stranger (comp. ver. 3). The proselytes shall not be treated as they fear. On the contrary, God will treat them in exactly the same way as his original people - will conduct them to Palestine, settle them in his \"holy mountain,\" admit them to the temple services, accept their burnt offerings and their sacrifices. All this will be a foretaste of their position in the Christian Church, where there will be neither Jew nor Gentile, neither circumcision nor uncircumcision, but a community where all are brethren and all have equal privileges.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah56:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTEven them will I bring to my holy mountain, and make them joyful in my house of prayer: their burnt offerings and their sacrifices shall be accepted upon mine altar; for mine house shall be called an house of prayer for all people.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 7. - My house of prayer. In Solomon's address to God at the dedication of the temple, its character, as a house of prayer, is abundantly laid down (1 Kings 8:29-53). And no doubt it was used for the purpose of prayer, as well as for the purpose of sacrifice, from its first erection to its final destruction. But the purpose of sacrifice so far predominated, in fact, over the other, that the expression, \"my house of prayer,\" comes upon us in this place to some extent as a surprise. The prophet seems to anticipate the time when the temple should be emphatically a προσευχή the legal sacrifices having received their fulfilment (Isaiah 53:10), and being thenceforth superfluous and out of place. For all people; rather, for all the peoples. All the ends of the earth were to see the salvation of God (Psalm 98:3); \"All nations were to fall down before him; all people to do him service\" (Psalm 72:11).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah56:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe Lord GOD which gathereth the outcasts of Israel saith, Yet will I gather others to him, beside those that are gathered unto him.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 8. - The Lord God; rather, the Lord Jehovah - Adonai Jehovah.

This same Lord now promises something further: \"He will gather others also to Israel, besides his own gathered ones.\" Introduced with such emphasis and formality, this was probably, when delivered, a new revelation. In the present arrangement of the prophecies, however, it announces no novelty. The addition of Gentile members to the Israelite community has been declared frequently (see Isaiah 44:5; Isaiah 55:5, etc.). Section V.

A sudden change of style marks the introduction of an entirely new prophecy. The eye of the prophet, apparently, goes back from the period of the exile, which he has been so long contemplating, to his own day, or at any rate to the pre-exile period, and rests upon Israel in their own land. He sees them misled by their teachers (vers. 10-12), given to idolatry (Isaiah 57:3-9), and offering themselves a ready prey to their enemies (Isaiah 56:9). Many modern critics regard the passage as the composition of an unknown prophet belonging to the time of Manasseh. But there is no sufficient evidence of this. The prophecy has many Isaiah characteristics. Verse 9. - Beasts of the field... beasts in the forest; i.e. \"all wild beasts of whatever kind\" - all the enemies of God's flock (see Jeremiah 12:9; Ezekiel 34:8). Come to devour. Make haste, now is your opportunity. The people have none to protect them, and will be an easy prey. Come, set to work; devour.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah56:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHis watchmen are blind: they are all ignorant, they are all dumb dogs, they cannot bark; sleeping, lying down, loving to slumber.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 10. - His watchmen are blind. Israel's \"watchmen\" are his guides and teachers, the prophets (Isaiah 6:17; Ezekiel 3:17; Habakkuk 2:1, etc.). At the time of which Isaiah speaks, they are \"blind\" (Isaiah 29:18; Isaiah 35:5; Isaiah 42:7, 16, 18, 19; Isaiah 43:8, etc.), or without knowledge - like the \"blind guides\" of the Gospel (Matthew 15:14; Luke 6:39, etc.). They have not the spiritual discernment which would enable them to lead the people aright. Further, they are dumb dogs. Instead of acting as faithful watch-dogs, who give warning of the approach of danger by their barking, they remain apathetic, and utter no warning at all. It is as if they passed their lives in sleep.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah56:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTYea, they are greedy dogs which can never have enough, and they are shepherds that cannot understand: they all look to their own way, every one for his gain, from his quarter.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 11. - Yea, they are greedy dogs. Another defect is noted. Not only do they fail in the way of neglect of duty, but they are actively culpable. Being worldly and not spiritually minded, they are \"greedy\" after gain. Anciently, the taking of a gift, or fee, from those who came to consult them was regarded as no dishonour to the prophetic office (Numbers 22:7; 1 Samuel 9:7; 1 Kings 14:3); but the nobler class of prophets declined to make a profit of their spiritual powers, and would receive no fee (2 Kings 5:16; Matthew 10:8; Acts 8:20). In Ezekiel and Micah the taking of gifts by prophets is regarded as discreditable (Ezekiel 13:19; Ezekiel 22:25; Micah 3:3). From his quarter; rather, to the uttermost (Kay), or every one, without exception (Cheyne).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah56:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTCome ye, say they, I will fetch wine, and we will fill ourselves with strong drink; and to morrow shall be as this day, and much more abundant.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 12. - Come ye, say they, I will fetch wine. Here we have mention of a third defect. The prophets of the time are not only negligent of their duty, and covetous, but they are given to excess in wine and to long revels, such as even the heathen considered to be disgraceful (comp. Isaiah 28:7, where both priests and prophets are taxed with habitual drunkenness). To-morrow shall be as this day; i.e. the drinking shall continue - we will have a two days' bout of it. And much more abundant; rather, very exceedingly abundant. There is no comparison of one day with the other; but simply a promise that on both days the drinking shall be without stint. (On the drunkenness occasionally prevalent in Oriental countries, see Herod.,1:133; Xen., 'Cyrop.,' 8:8, § 10; Dur. Samuel Fr., 13; and compare the remarks of Sir H. Rawlinson on the inebriety of the modern Persians in the author's ' Herodotus,' vol. 1. p. 219, edition of 1862.)NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINE","Isa.57":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah57:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe righteous perisheth, and no man layeth it to heart: and merciful men are taken away, none considering that the righteous is taken away from the evil to come.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 1, 2. - THE EARLY DEATH OF RIGHTEOUS MEN ACCOUNTED FOR. The Hebrews were given to expect that long life should, as a general rule, accompany righteousness (Exodus 20:12; 1 Kings 3:14; Psalm 91:16; Proverbs 3:1, 2, etc.); and under the Mosaical dispensation we must suppose that it did so. But there were exceptions to the rule. Wicked persecutors, like Ahab, Jezebel, and Athaliah, cut off the righteous ere they had seen half their days. So probably did Manasseh (2 Kings 24:3, 4). And God sometimes removed the righteous from earth by a natural death before they had grown old (Ecclesiastes 7:15; Ecclesiastes 8:14). At the time of which Isaiah is here speaking there had been such removals; and of this he takes note, partly to rebuke those who lightly passed over the phenomenon, partly to justify God's ways to such as were perplexed by it. Verse 1. - The righteous perisheth. The word translated \"perisheth\" does not imply any violence; but the context implies a premature death. The righteous disappear - are taken from the earth before their natural time. Yet no man layeth it to heart; i.e. no one asks what it means - no one is disturbed, no one grieves. The general feeling was either one of indifference, or of relief at the departure of one whose life was a reproach to his neighbours. Merciful men; rather, godly men, or pious men (comp. Micah 7:2). Are taken away; literally, are gathered in. Compare the phrase so frequently used, \"gathered to his fathers\" (Genesis 49:29; Numbers 27:13; Judges 2:10; 2 Kings 22:20; 2 Chronicles 34:28). From the evil; or, out of the way of the evil - in order that he may escape it (comp. 2 Kings 22:20, where Josiah is promised that he shall be gathered to his fathers (prematurely), in order that he may escape the sight of the evil that was coming on Jerusalem soon after his decease.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah57:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHe shall enter into peace: they shall rest in their beds, each one walking in his uprightness.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 2. - He shall enter into peace. Not merely into \"stillness\" or \"silence\" (Psalm 115:17), but into \"peace,\" or, as the word might be rendered (Cheyne), \"a state of peace.\" There is, no doubt, primarily, \"a contrast to the awful troubles which the survivors will have to encounter\" (Hengstenberg); but perhaps this contrast is not all that is meant. The \"peace\" is positive rather than negative, or it would scarcely be a consolation to any one. They shall rest in their beds; or, upon their beds. This expression seems to imply a consciousness of rest, and so a certain enjoyment of it. Each one walking in his uprightness; rather, whosoever hath walked uprightly, or in a straight path (see Proverbs 4:25-27). The phrase is an equivalent for \"the righteous\" of ver. 1, and refers to the life on earth of those who have gone down into silence, not to their life after they have reached the silent shore. Of that life the evangelical prophet is not commissioned to give us any information.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah57:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut draw near hither, ye sons of the sorceress, the seed of the adulterer and the whore.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 3-14. - ISRAEL SEVERELY REBUKED FOR IDOLATRY. Though Hezekiah had made a great reformation of religion when he ascended the throne(2 Kings 18:4; 2 Chronicles 29:3-19), and had done his best to put down idolatry, yet it was still dear to large numbers among the people, and was easily revived by Manasseh in the earlier portion of his reign (2 Chronicles 33:2-9). Isaiah now rebukes various kinds of idolatrous practices, and shows the vanity of them. Verse 3. - Draw near hither. Approach, to hear the reprimand which ye so well deserve. Ye sons of the sorceress; rather, of a sorceress. Judah herself, the nation, is the\" sorceress\" and \"adulteress,\" whose individual children are summoned to draw near. She is an adulteress; for she has transgressed against the mystic marriage-tie which bound her to Jehovah (see Isaiah 54:5, and the comment ad lot.). She is also a \"sorceress,\" since she has bewitched her children, and given herself up to magical as well as to idolatrous practices (2 Chronicles 33:6). Seed of the adulterer and the whore; rather, seed of an adulteress, and that thyself committest whoredom. The congenital tendency has broken out into act. The Israel addressed is as \"adulterous,\" i.e. idolatrous, as the Israel of former times.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah57:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAgainst whom do ye sport yourselves? against whom make ye a wide mouth, and draw out the tongue? are ye not children of transgression, a seed of falsehood,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 4. - Against whom do ye sport yourselves? The idolatrous Israelites here addressed, no doubt, made a mock of the few righteous who were still living among them, and vexed their souls, as his fellow-towns-men did the soul of \"just Lot\" (2 Peter 2:7). They \"made wide the mouth\" at them, and \"drew out the tongue\" in derision (comp. Psalm 22:7; Psalm 35:21). The prophet asks, \"Against whom do ye do this? Is it not rather against God, whose servants these men are, than against them?\" Are ye not children of transgression? rather, are ye not, yourselves, children of apostasy? and therefore more truly objects of scorn than they? A seed of falsehood. Idols were viewed by Isaiah as \"lies\" (Isaiah 45:20; cf. Romans 1:25; Revelation 22:15). Idolaters were therefore \"a seed of falsehood\" - men who put their trust in a lie.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah57:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTEnflaming yourselves with idols under every green tree, slaying the children in the valleys under the clifts of the rocks?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 5. - Inflaming yourselves with idols under every green tree (comp. Isaiah 1:29; Isaiah 65:3; Isaiah 66:17; and see also 2 Kings 16:4; 2 Kings 17:10; Jeremiah 2:20; Jeremiah 3:6, etc.). The reference is, as Mr. Cheyne says, to the \"orgiastic cults' in the sacred groves of Palestinian heathenism.\" The nature of these cults is well stated by Professor Dollinger ('Jew and Gentile,' vol. 1. p. 430): \"At the spring festival, called by some the 'brand-feast,' by others that of torches, which was attended by streams of visitors from every country, huge trees were burnt, with the offerings suspended on them. Even children were sacrificed; they were put into a leathern bag, and thrown the whole height of the temple to the bottom, with the shocking expression that they were calves, and not children. In the fore-court stood two gigantic phalli. To the exciting din of drums, flutes, and inspired songs, the Galli cut themselves on the arms; and the effect of this act, and of the music accompanying it, was so strong upon mere spectators, that all their bodily and mental powers were thrown into a tumult of excitement; and they too, seized by the desire to lacerate themselves, deprived themselves of their manhood by means of potsherds lying ready for the purpose.\" Slaying the children in the valleys under the clefts of the rocks. The sacrifice of their children to Moloch was largely practised by the Jews in the later period of the kingdom of Judah. It seems to have been originally introduced by the superstitious Ahaz, the father of Hezekiah, who \"made his son to pass through the fire, according to the abominations of the heathen\" (2 Kings 16:3; 2 Chronicles 28:3). Suspended during the reign of Hezekiah, it was renewed under Manasseh, who followed the example of his grandfather in himself sacrificing one of his sons (2 Kings 21:6). Under the last three kings it prevailed to a very wide extent, and the prophets Jeremiah and Ezekiel are loud in their denunciations of it (Jeremiah 7:31, 32; Jeremiah 19:2-6; Jeremiah 32:35; Ezekiel 16:20; Ezekiel 20:26; Ezekiel 23:37, etc.). Arguments have been brought forward to prove that the child was merely passed before a fire, or between two fires, and not burnt; but the evidence to the contrary is overwhelming (see the article on \"Moloch\" in Dr. W. Smith's 'Dictionary of the Bible,' vol. 2, pp. 403, 404). The rite belonged especially to the worship of Chemosh and Moloch by the Moabites and Ammonites (2 Kings 3:27; Micah 6:7), from whom it was adopted by the Israelites (2 Kings 17:7) and Jews. The sacrifice was supposed to be expiatory (Micah 6:7). In the later times of the Jewish kingdom the place of sacrifice was the valley of Hinnom, west and north of Jerusalem, which is overhung by rugged rocks.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah57:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAmong the smooth stones of the stream is thy portion; they, they are thy lot: even to them hast thou poured a drink offering, thou hast offered a meat offering. Should I receive comfort in these?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 6. - Among the smooth stones of the stream is thy portion. Smooth stones, rounded by water-action, were among the objects worshipped by many Semitic peoples. Such stones were called βαίτυλοι or βαιτύλια - Bethels, or \"houses of God \" - and received libations of oil and wine from their worshippers (see Genesis 28:18; and comp. Herod., 3:8; Arnob., 'Adv. Gentes,' 1:39; Lucian, 'Pseudomant.,' p. 30; Apul., p. 349; etc.). Stones of this kind, the prophet says, had now become \"the portion\" of Israel, instead of Jehovah (Psalm 119:57; comp. Psalm 16:5). To such objects they offered their \"meat offerings\" and \"drink offerings.\" Should I receive comfort in these? Can I, Jehovah, be comforted, when my people indulge in such practices?NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah57:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTUpon a lofty and high mountain hast thou set thy bed: even thither wentest thou up to offer sacrifice.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 7. - Upon a lofty and high mountain hast thou set thy bed. Instead of reserving thy marriage-bed for me, Jehovah (Isaiah 54:5), thou hast set it up on those \"high places,\" with which the hill-tops of Judaea are everywhere crowned (see 1 Kings 14:23; 1 Kings 16:4; 2 Chronicles 33:17; Ezekiel 15:16, etc.). Almost every hill-top is still, in a sense, held sacred in Palestine (Conder, in 'Quarterly Statement of Palest. Explor. Fund,' 1875, p. 39). Even thither wentest thou up, etc. (On the persistency of the Jews in maintaining the high-place worship, see 1 Kings 14:23; 1 Kings 15:14; 1 Kings 22:43; 2 Kings 12:3; 2 Kings 14:4; 2 Kings 15:4; 2 Kings 21:3, etc.) The best kings failed in their attempts to put it downNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah57:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBehind the doors also and the posts hast thou set up thy remembrance: for thou hast discovered thyself to another than me, and art gone up; thou hast enlarged thy bed, and made thee a covenant with them; thou lovedst their bed where thou sawest it.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 8. - Behind the doors also and the posts hast thou set up thy remembrance. It has been usual to explain this of a removal from its proper place into an obscure position of the formulae which the Israelites were commanded in the Law to write on their doorposts and on their gates (Deuteronomy 6:9; Deuteronomy 11:20). But, in the first place, there is no evidence that anciently these passages were understood literally, or that such inscriptions were ever set up; and secondly, as Mr. Cheyne remarks, they would have been more, rather than less, conspicuous in a new place. Probably, therefore, the \"memorial\" (zikkaron) of this place is some idolatrous symbol or emblem newly adopted by the Jews, and made use of as a sort of talisman. Many commentators think that it was of a phallic character (see Ezekiel 16:17). Discovered thyself; rather, uncovered thyself. Thou hast enlarged thy bed; i.e. multiplied thy idolatries (comp. 2 Kings 16:3, 4, 10; 2 Kings 21:3-7). It is a feature of the idolatry of the time, that it was a mixture adopted from many quarters. It included Baal and Ashtoreth-worship from Phoenicia, Moloch-worship from Moab and Ammos, worship of the Queen of Heaven from Syria, high-place worship from the Canaanites, and stone-worship from their own remote Mesopotamian ancestors. And made thee a covenant with them; i.e. \"a bargain for wages,\" that aid and protection should be rendered in return for worship and sacrifice. Where thou sawest it. The original is very obscure, but can scarcely have this meaning. It is certainly a distinct clause, and may perhaps be best translated, \"thou sawest indecency.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah57:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd thou wentest to the king with ointment, and didst increase thy perfumes, and didst send thy messengers far off, and didst debase thyself even unto hell.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 9. - And thou wentest to the king, Delitzsch and Mr. Cheyne understand \"the King of Assyria,\" and regard the verse as bringing forward a new subject of complaint: \"Not only hast thou deserted me tot other gods, but thou trustest for aid, not to me, but to the Assyrian monarch.\" But there is no indication of the Jews having put any trust in Assyria after the reign of Ahaz, to which this chapter, by its position in the prophecy, cannot belong. Moreover, the King of Assyria is never called simply\" the king.\" It is, therefore, better to regard \"the king\" as Moloch, whom the Jews of Isaiah's time certainly worshipped (see ver. 5), and whose name was a mere dialectic variety of Melech, \"king\" (see Dean Payne Smith's ' Sermons on Isaiah,' sermon 4. p. 119). Ointment... perfumes. Either bearing them as offerings, or herself perfumed with them, as was the practice of lewd women (Proverbs 7:17). And didst send thy messengers far off; i.e. to distant Moloch-shrines. And didst debase thyself even unto hell; i.e. \"didst take on thee the yoke of a mean and grovelling superstition, which debased thee to the lowest point conceivable.\" There was nothing lower in religion than the worship of Moloch.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah57:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThou art wearied in the greatness of thy way; yet saidst thou not, There is no hope: thou hast found the life of thine hand; therefore thou wast not grieved.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 10. - Thou art wearied in the greatness of thy way. Judah had travelled far from God, seeking aid from all quarters, and might well be \"wearied\" with her quest; but she would not confess her weariness she would not say. There is no hope; she stirred up her remaining strength, and persisted in her course, not suffering herself to \"grieve.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah57:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd of whom hast thou been afraid or feared, that thou hast lied, and hast not remembered me, nor laid it to thy heart? have not I held my peace even of old, and thou fearest me not?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 11. - Of whom hast thou been afraid? Judah's abandonment of Jehovah and devotion to new deities was caused by fear - the fear of man, especially of Assyria. This induced them to seek for help in each new superstition that presented itself, and produced the enlarged syncretism which has been noticed in the comment on ver. 8. But how absurd to be driven by fear of man into offending God! That thou hast lied (see the last clause of ver. 4, with the comment). Have not I held my peace, etc.? i.e. \"Is it not because I have for so long a time held my peace, that thou fearest me not?\" God had for a long time suffered them to \"go on still in their wickedness\" - he had not interposed with any severe judgment; therefore they had ceased to fear him, and had feared men instead.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah57:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTI will declare thy righteousness, and thy works; for they shall not profit thee.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 12. - I will declare thy righteousness, etc. The Syriac Version has \"my righteousness,\" which gives a much better sense, and is adopted by Bishop Lowth, Dr. Weir, and Mr. Cheyne. God will be silent no longer. He will\" declare,\" or show forth, \"his righteousness,\" by visiting Judah with some righteous punishment. Then it will be seen of what value are those things in which Judah has hitherto trusted. Her works - whether her \"idols\" are meant (Cheyne, Delitzsch), or her \"deeds of iniquity\" (Kay) - what will they profit? She will \"cry\" out under the rod of chastisement - cry to her false gods to save her.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah57:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWhen thou criest, let thy companies deliver thee; but the wind shall carry them all away; vanity shall take them: but he that putteth his trust in me shall possess the land, and shall inherit my holy mountain;VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 13. - When thou criest, let thy companies deliver thee. Then, when she thus cries, let her mixture of gods (ver. 8), if they can, deliver her; they will fail utterly to do so. The wind - or rather, a breath - shall carry them all away; vanity shall take them. The idol gods shall be shown to be wholly futile, unable to save, incapable of rendering any the slightest assistance. But he that putteth his trust in me shall possess the land. If, however, at that dread hour, there be any among the people who are not idolaters, but \"trust in Jehovah,\" the crisis shall turn to their advantage. They shall \"possess the land,\" i.e. have the promised land for their inheritance (Deuteronomy 4:1; Deuteronomy 5:33; Psalm 37:11-29, etc.); and inherit Zion, God's holy mountain (see Isaiah 11:9; Isaiah 27:13; 567, etc.).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah57:14VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd shall say, Cast ye up, cast ye up, prepare the way, take up the stumblingblock out of the way of my people.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 14. - And shall say; rather, and one said. The prophet hears a voice, saying, Cast ye up, cast ye up; i.e. make a highway to the holy mountain by heaping up material (Isaiah 62:10); and, having made it, remove every obstruction from the path of my (righteous) people. The voice is, probably, an angelic one.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah57:15VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor thus saith the high and lofty One that inhabiteth eternity, whose name is Holy; I dwell in the high and holy place, with him also that is of a contrite and humble spirit, to revive the spirit of the humble, and to revive the heart of the contrite ones.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 15-21. - A PROMISE OF SALVATION TO THE HUMBLE AND PENITENT, WITH A FURTHER THREAT AGAINST THE WICKED. The prophet, in this portion of his discourse, whereof \"comfort\" is the key-note (Isaiah 40:1), can never continue threatening long without relapsing into a tone of tenderness and pity. He now sets against his long denunciation (in vers. 3-12) an ample promise (vers. 15-19), and against his brief encouragement (in vers. 13, 14) a short menace (vers. 20, 21). Verse 15. - For. The ground of the promise of salvation in ver. 15 is God's combined might and mercy, which are now set forth. The high and lofty One (comp. Isaiah 6:1, where the same words are translated \"high and lifted up\"). In God's loftiness are included at once his exalted majesty and his almighty power. He is \"high\" in himself, transcending thought, and \"lofty\" or \"lifted up\" in that he is absolute Lord of his creatures, and therefore high above them. That inhabiteth eternity. So the LXX., κατοικῶν τὸν αἰῶνα But the Hebrew is less abstract, and would perhaps be best translated \"that liveth eternally.\" I dwell in the high and holy place. Solomon's \"heaven of heavens\" (1 Kings 8:27), which, however, \"cannot contain him;\" St. Paul's \"light which no man can approach unto\" (1 Timothy 6:16); Zechariah's \"holy habitation\" (Zechariah 2:13). With him also that is of a contrite - literally, crushed - and humble spirit. \"Though the Lord be high, yet hath he respect unto the lowly \"(Psalm 138:6); \"He humbleth himself to consider the things that are in heaven and earth\" (Psalm 113:6). He is not an Epicurean Deity, too far exalted above man to have any regard for him, or concern himself with man's welfare (see Job 22:12, 13). On the contrary, he condescends to \"dwell with\" man, only let man have a \"humble\" and \"crushed,\" or \"bruised,\" spirit. To revive the spirit of the humble. When God condescends to visit the contrite and humble spirit, the immediate effect is to comfort, console, revive. His presence is a well of life. springing up within the soul to everlasting life (John 4:14).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah57:16VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor I will not contend for ever, neither will I be always wroth: for the spirit should fail before me, and the souls which I have made.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 16. - I will not contend for ever. God \"will not always chide, neither will he keep his anger for ever\" (Psalm 103:9). If he were \"extreme to mark what is done amiss,\" none could abide it (Psalm 130:3). He remits somewhat, therefore, from the claims of strict justice, and is content to take lower ground. Were it otherwise, man's spirit should fail before him. Man, i.e., would be utterly unable to justify himself, and would faint and fade away before the Divine fury. The souls which God has made would, one and all, perish. He, however, has not made them for this purpose, but that they should live (Deuteronomy 30:19; Ezekiel 18:31); and has therefore devised for them a way of salvation (see Isaiah 53:5-10).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah57:17VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor the iniquity of his covetousness was I wroth, and smote him: I hid me, and was wroth, and he went on frowardly in the way of his heart.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 17. - For the iniquity of his covetousness was I wroth. Among the sins that angered God most against the Jews of the later kingdom of Judah was their covetousness - that desire of unjust gain which led them continually to oppress their weaker brethren, to remove their neighbours' landmarks, to harass them with lawsuits, to obtain from the courts corrupt judgments against them, and so to strip them of their inheritances (see Isaiah 1:15-23; Isaiah 3:5, 14, 15; Isaiah 5:8, 23; Jeremiah 6:13; Ezekiel 33:31, etc.). This was far from being their only sin; but it was their besetting sin, and it led on to a number of others. It would seem even to have been the principal cause of those judicial murders with which they are so constantly taxed by the prophets (Isaiah 1:15, 21: 33:15; 59:3; Jeremiah 2:34; Jeremiah 19:4; Ezekiel 7:23; Ezekiel 11:6; Hosea 4:2; Micah 3:10; Micah 7:2, etc.). Isaiah selects the sin of covetousness here, as typical or representative of the entire class of Judah's besetting sins - the most striking indication of that alienation of their hearts from God, which constituted their real guilt, and was the true cause of their punishment. And smote him. The form of the verb marks repeated action. God gave Judah many warning's before the final catastrophe. He punished Judah by the hand of Sargon, by that of Sennacherib (2 Kings 18:14-16), by that of Manasseh (2 Chronicles 33:11), by that of Pharaoh-Necho (2 Chronicles 35:20-24), by that of the Syrians, the Moabites and the Ammonites (2 Kings 24:2), and others, during the hundred and forty years which intervened between the accession of Hezekiah and the completion of the Captivity. I hid me (comp. Isaiah 8:17; Isaiah 54:8).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah57:18VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTI have seen his ways, and will heal him: I will lead him also, and restore comforts unto him and to his mourners.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 18. - I have seen his ways, and will heal him. God had seen the wanderings of his people in perverse ways, and his heart had been touched with pity thereat. The good Shepherd follows and recalls the wanderers of the flock. When they have suffered hurt he \"heals\" them. He is willing to \"lead\" them also - to go before them, and show them the way that they should walk in (Isaiah 49:10; Ezekiel 34:11-16), and \"restore comforts\" to them, especially to such of them as have begun to \"mourn\" over their perversity.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah57:19VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTI create the fruit of the lips; Peace, peace to him that is far off, and to him that is near, saith the LORD; and I will heal him.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 19. - I create the fruit of the lips; literally, creating the fruit of the lips. The clause is best attached to the preceding verse. By his tender treatment of the wanderers, God brings forth fruit from their lips in the shape of praise and thanksgiving. Peace, peace; or, perfect peace, as in Isaiah 26:3. Judah's prophets were apt to say to her, \"Peace, peace,\" when there was no peace (Jeremiah 6:14; Jeremiah 8:11; Ezekiel 13:10). Isaiah is now commissioned to give the promise from the mouth of God (comp. John 14:27; John 20:21, 26). To him that is far off, and to him that is near; i.e. either \"to both the Gentiles and the Jews,\" or \"to both the scattered members of the Jewish body\" (Isaiah 11:11; Isaiah 43:5, 6) \"and the collected nation in Canaan.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah57:20VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut the wicked are like the troubled sea, when it cannot rest, whose waters cast up mire and dirt.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 20. - The wicked are like the troubled sea. A striking metaphor, but one which occurs nowhere else in the Old Testament, and once only in the New (Jude 1:13). The sea's restless action well expresses the unquiet of the wicked; and the mud and mire that it casts up resembles their evil thoughts and evil deeds. \"There is no peace\" for such persons, either bodily or spiritual, either in this world or the world to come.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah57:21VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThere is no peace, saith my God, to the wicked.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 21. - Comp.

As in the last section, so here, the prophet's eye seems to rest upon his contemporaries rather than upon the exiles; and to note the vices of the time, which have a general resemblance to those rebuked in ch. 1. The whole Law seems to be in force, and the People to make a show of keeping it, and to complain that they are not properly rewarded for their religiousness. God tears the mask from their face, and shows the difference between true religion and the pretence of it. Verse 1. - Cry aloud; literally, cry from the throat; \"a plein gosier,\" as Calvin says. The command is addressed to the prophet by Jehovah, who will have him warn the people in such sort as to compel their attention. Lift up thy voice like a trumpet (comp. Hosea 8:1; Joel 2:1). The trumpet gives a note of alarm. Show my people their transgression; i.e. \"show them how they are especially offending me at this time\" (see Micah 3:8).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah58:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTYet they seek me daily, and delight to know my ways, as a nation that did righteousness, and forsook not the ordinance of their God: they ask of me the ordinances of justice; they take delight in approaching to God.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 2. - They seek me daily, and delight to know my ways (compare the picture drawn in Isaiah 1:11-15). We have there exactly the same representation of a people honouring God with their lips, but whose hearts are far from him - zealous in all the outward forms of religion, even making \"many prayers\" (Isaiah 1:15), but yet altogether an offence to God. They are not conscious hypocrites - quite the reverse; they are bent on \"doing righteousness,\" on not forsaking God's ordinance, on continually \"approaching\" him; but they are wholly without a proper sense of what religion is - they make it a matter of outward observance, and do not understand that it consists in the devotion of the heart. That did righteousness, and forsook not; rather, that hath done righteousness, and hath not forsaken. The righteousness is, of course, forensic legal righteousness-the offering of the appointed sacrifices, the abstaining from unclean meats, the avoidance of external defilement, the payment of vows, the observance of the one appointed fast, and the like. They ask of me the ordinances of justice. Either \"they claim at God's hands righteous judgments on their enemies\" (Delitzsch); or \"they demand of God a fidelity to his covenant engagements correspondent to their own (assumed) fidelity to theirs.\" They take delight in approaching to God. So the LXX., the Vulgate, Calvin, Vitringa, and Kay. Others prefer to render, \"they desire the approach of God\" (Knobel, Delitzsch, Cheyne); i.e. they desire that he will come to help them against their foes.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah58:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWherefore have we fasted, say they, and thou seest not? wherefore have we afflicted our soul, and thou takest no knowledge? Behold, in the day of your fast ye find pleasure, and exact all your labours.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 3. - Wherefore have we fasted, say they, and thou seest not? The fasting' spoken of is probably that of the great Day of Atonement. the only fasting commanded in the Law (Leviticus 16:29, 31). Other fasts were from time to time appointed by civil or ecclesiastical authority (1 Kings 21:9, 12:2 Chronicles 20:3; Joel 1:14; Joel 2:12, 15); but they were rare, and do not seem to be here intended. Still, the lesson is general, and would apply to all occasions of fasting. The Jews of the time expected, it would seem, some special definite result, in the way of victory or relief, to follow from their observance of the Atonement fast. As it did not follow, they regarded themselves as ill used, and accordingly made complaint. Their feelings approached to those of the Vedic worshippers, who regarded their religious observances as \"not merely pleasing. the god who was the object of them, but as laying him under a binding obligation, and almost compelling him to grant the requests of the worshipper\" ('Religions of the Ancient World,' pp. 143, 144). Afflicted our soul These are the exact words of Leviticus 16:29, 31, by which the fast of the great Day of Atonement was instituted. And thou takest no knowledge; rather, no notice. In the day of your fast ye find pleasure. Delitzsch and Mr. Cheyne render, \"ye carry on business,\" which accords better with the clause which follows. The great Day of Atonement was, like the sabbath, a day on which no work was to be done (Leviticus 16:29). The Jews, while priding themselves on their observance of the day, did not really observe it in this particular. And exact all your labours; i.e. \"require of your servants and subordinates all the services that they have to render on other days.\" Days of religious observance, even under the Law, were always intended to be days of kindly forbearance towards the poor, of the remission of burdens, or even of the actual giving of relief.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah58:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBehold, ye fast for strife and debate, and to smite with the fist of wickedness: ye shall not fast as ye do this day, to make your voice to be heard on high.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 4. - Ye fast for strife and debate. Delitzsch explains, \"When fasting, they are doubly irritable and ill tempered; and this leads to quarrelling and strife, even to striking with angry fists.\" This is quite a possible explanation. Or there may have been two parties, one for, the other against, fasting; and those who practised fasting may have done it, as some preached Christ, \"of envy and strife\" (Philippians 1:15) - to provoke the opposite side. Ye shall not fast as ye do this day, to make your voice to be heard on high; i.e. \"ye must not fast as ye do at present, if ye would have your voices heard in heaven.\" God will not hear the prayer of which such a fast is the accompaniment.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah58:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTIs it such a fast that I have chosen? a day for a man to afflict his soul? is it to bow down his head as a bulrush, and to spread sackcloth and ashes under him? wilt thou call this a fast, and an acceptable day to the LORD?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 5. - Is it such a fast that I have chosen, etc.? Do you suppose that such can be the fast commanded by me in the Law - a fast which is expressly called \"a day for a man to afflict his soul\"? Is afflicting one's soul simply bowing down one's head as a bulrush, and making one's couch on sackcloth and ashes? Surely it is much more than this. (On the employment of \"sackcloth and ashes\" in fasting, see Esther 4:3; Daniel 9:3; Jonah 3:6.)NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah58:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTIs not this the fast that I have chosen? to loose the bands of wickedness, to undo the heavy burdens, and to let the oppressed go free, and that ye break every yoke?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 6. - Is not this the fast that I have chosen? This passage, as Dr. Kay observes, \"stands like a homily for the Day of Atonement.\" Such homilies are found in the uninspired Jewish writings ('Taanith,' 2:1; 'Nedarim babli,' p. 10, a, etc.), and are conceived very much in the same spirit. The Jews call the true fast \"the fasting of the heart.\" To loose the bands of wickedness. To set free those whom wicked persons have wrongfully imprisoned or entangled. To undo the heavy burdens; literally, to untie the thongs of the yoke. The liberation of a man's slaves, or of Jews captive among the heathen (Nehemiah 5:8), is probably intended. To let the oppressed (literally, the bruised) go free. Remission of debts and restoration of pledges (Nehemiah 10:31; Ezekiel 18:7) are, perhaps, the acts pointed at.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah58:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTIs it not to deal thy bread to the hungry, and that thou bring the poor that are cast out to thy house? when thou seest the naked, that thou cover him; and that thou hide not thyself from thine own flesh?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 7. - Is it not to deal thy bread to the hungry? In the early Christian Church almsgiving was connected with fasting by law (Dressel's 'Patr. Apost.,' p. 493). It was also accepted as a moral axiom that \"fasting and alms were the wings of prayer.\" Cast out; or, homeless ἀστέγους LXX.). That thou hide not thyself from thine own flesh. Their \"flesh\" were not merely their near kindred, but their countrymen generally (see Nehemiah 5:5).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah58:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen shall thy light break forth as the morning, and thine health shall spring forth speedily: and thy righteousness shall go before thee; the glory of the LORD shall be thy rereward.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 8. - Then. When thou hast taken this advice to heart, and adopted it, and made it the rule of thy conduct. Upon such a change in thee, all good things shall follow. Thou shalt have no more to complain of unanswered prayers or covenant promises left in abeyance (see the comment on vers. 2 and 3). Shall thy lightbreak forth; i.e. thy glorious, time shall begin (comp Isaiah 50:1). Thine health - rather, thine healing; the \"healing of thy bruise,\" or thy recovery from the low estate to which thy sins have brought thee down - shall spring forth speedily; i.e. shall soon manifest itself; and the result will be twofold:NEWLINENEWLINE(1) thy own righteousness will go before thee - will be, as it were, thy vanguard; andNEWLINENEWLINE(2) The glory of the Lord; i.e. the glory which he will confer upon thee, will follow thee up, and be, as it were, thy rearguard (comp. Isaiah 52:12).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah58:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen shalt thou call, and the LORD shall answer; thou shalt cry, and he shall say, Here I am. If thou take away from the midst of thee the yoke, the putting forth of the finger, and speaking vanity;VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 9. - If thou take away from the midst of thee the yoke (comp. ver. 6). The putting forth of the finger. The pointing of the finger at any one in scorn. And speaking vanity; rather, speaking evil, or plotting evil, against others.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah58:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd if thou draw out thy soul to the hungry, and satisfy the afflicted soul; then shall thy light rise in obscurity, and thy darkness be as the noonday:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 10. - If thou draw out thy soul to the hungry; i.e. not merely giving him bread, but giving him sympathy and compassion with it. Then shall thy light rise in obscurity (comp. Psalm 112:4, \"Unto the godly there riseth up light in the darkness;\" and see above, ver. 8).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah58:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the LORD shall guide thee continually, and satisfy thy soul in drought, and make fat thy bones: and thou shalt be like a watered garden, and like a spring of water, whose waters fail not.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 11. - The Lord shall guide thee continually; i.e. \"direct thee in all thy paths - teach thee the way that thou shouldst walk in.\" In drought. In time of spiritual depression and weariness. Make fat thy bones; i.e. sustain thy strength. Thou shall; be like a watered garden (comp. Jeremiah 31:12).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah58:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd they that shall be of thee shall build the old waste places: thou shalt raise up the foundations of many generations; and thou shalt be called, The repairer of the breach, The restorer of paths to dwell in.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 12. - They that shall be of thee shall build the old waste places. Thy descendants shall restore all that has fallen into decay in Israel, whether it be cities or customs. They shall restore \"breaches\" of every kind, and bring back the old paths for thee to walk in. The restoration of the ruined cities of Judah may be glanced at, but is far from exhausting the writer's meaning (comp. Isaiah 61:4).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah58:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTIf thou turn away thy foot from the sabbath, from doing thy pleasure on my holy day; and call the sabbath a delight, the holy of the LORD, honourable; and shalt honour him, not doing thine own ways, nor finding thine own pleasure, nor speaking thine own words:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 13, 14. - A STRICT OBSERVANCE OF THE SABBATH ENJOINED. While the fasting of the day only required to be spiritualized, the sabbath observance needed both spiritualizing and increased strictness. From 2 Chronicles 36:21 we learn that the sabbatical years had been little observed during the later Jewish kingdom; and it would Seem from the present passage (comp. Jeremiah 17:21-23) that even the observance of the sabbath itself had been neglected. Not that the neglect was total. The sacrifices proper to the sabbath were duly offered - the \"solemn assembly\" was duly called and attended (Isaiah 1:13); but during the rest of the day business flowed in its usual course - the complete sanctification of the entire day was set aside. We find a similar laxity prevalent after the return from the Captivity (Nehemiah 10:31; Nehemiah 13:15, 16). Verse 13. - If thou turn away thy foot from the sabbath; i.e. treat it with reverence, as if it were \"holy ground\" (Exodus 3:5; Proverbs 4:27). From doing thy pleasure; rather, from doing thy business - the same expression as in ver. 3. It is by \"business,\" not by pleasure, that the sabbath was polluted both in the time of Jeremiah (Jeremiah 17:21-23) and of Nehemiah (Nehemiah 10:31, etc.). And call the sabbath a delight. This is the spiritualization of the sabbath - \"to call\" and feel it \"a delight,\" a real satisfaction to the soul, not a weariness (Amos 8:5), as it was to many. And shalt honour him; rather, and shalt honour it; i.e. the sabbath, which is made masculine here, as in Isaiah 56:2. The sabbath was to be honoured by men not pursuing their own ordinary ways, or engaging in their regular business, or even carrying on their ordinary everyday talk. Literally, the command is, not to \"speak words;\" but no Jews were ever such strict sabbatarians as to understand this as prohibiting all speech on the sabbath. Some have held that sabbatical talk should be scanty, limited, restrained as much as possible; but even for this there is no warrant. It is the quality, rather than the quantity, of the words uttered that is of real importance.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah58:14VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen shalt thou delight thyself in the LORD; and I will cause thee to ride upon the high places of the earth, and feed thee with the heritage of Jacob thy father: for the mouth of the LORD hath spoken it.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 14. - Then shalt thou delight thyself in the Lord. Then shall communion with Jehovah become a real pleasure to thee. The acts of worship shall not be done merely from a sense of duty, because commanded, but because they are congenial to the soul of the worshipper. A right use of the sabbath will help to form in men habits of devotion, which will make religion a joy and a delight to them. I will cause thee to ride upon the high places of the earth; i.e. \"I will give thee a prominent position in the earth, and cause thee to occupy its high places, and hear rule over many nations.\" Something more than a \"taking triumphal possession of Palestine\" is evidently pointed at (see Deuteronomy 32:13). And feed thee with the heritage of Jacob thy father. The world itself was the \"heritage of Jacob,\" since in him and his seed \"all the families of the earth were to be blessed\" (Genesis 28:14). Israel, having laid aside its formalism, and turned to God sincerely. keeping fast and sabbath as God would have them kept, not in the letter, but in the spirit, would enter upon the promised heritage, and occupy the position originally assigned to it. Israel's rejection of the gospel made the mixed Christian Church the inheritress of the old promises.NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINE","Isa.59":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah59:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBehold, the LORD'S hand is not shortened, that it cannot save; neither his ear heavy, that it cannot hear:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 1-8. - A GENERAL REBUKE OF ISRAEL FOR ITS MANIFOLD SINS, The command given to the prophet in Isaiah 58:1 to \"show God's people their transgression, and the house of Jacob their sins \" - partly executed in Isaiah 58:4-7 and 13 - is now further carried out by a scathing denunciation of various forms of wickedness, more or less prevalent in Israel, the effect of which has been to separate between Israel and God, to \"shorten God's hand\" and \"make his ears heavy.\" The passage has many analogies with Isaiah 1:2-23. Verse 1. - The Lord's hand is not shortened; i.e. God is not less able to help than of old; his \"hand\" has lost none of its power. That he does not help is owing to the iniquities of his people, which have separated between him and them (ver. 2). It is the same fact which has made his ear heavy. He cannot hear prayers that are not sincere - not from the heart.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah59:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut your iniquities have separated between you and your God, and your sins have hid his face from you, that he will not hear.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 2. - Have separated; literally, have been separating. The force of the form used is continuous, and implies that Israel had now for a long time been heaping up a barrier between itself and Jehovah. Your sins have hid his face; literally, your sins have caused his face to be hidden from you, i.e. \"have made him avert it.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah59:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor your hands are defiled with blood, and your fingers with iniquity; your lips have spoken lies, your tongue hath muttered perverseness.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 3. - Your hands are defiled with blood (comp. Isaiah 1:15, 21). (On the \"innocent blood\" shed by the Jews of the later Judaean kingdom, see 2 Kings 21:6, 16; 2 Kings 24:4; 2 Kings 25:25; 2 Chronicles 24:21; 2 Chronicles 28:3; 2 Chronicles 33:6; 2 Chronicles 36:16, etc.) It consisted inNEWLINENEWLINE(1) sacrifices of children to Moloch;NEWLINENEWLINE(2) persecution of prophets; andNEWLINENEWLINE(3) judicial murders, either actual (like that of Naboth, in Israel) or virtual, i.e. such perversion of justice as produced general poverty and misery, and tended to shorten men's lives (see the comment on Isaiah 1:15). Your lips have spoken lies (comp. Isaiah 32:7). The wicked oppressors \"devised wicked devices to destroy the poor with lying words.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah59:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTNone calleth for justice, nor any pleadeth for truth: they trust in vanity, and speak lies; they conceive mischief, and bring forth iniquity.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 4. - None calleth for justice; rather, none preferreth his suit in justice (so Lowth, Gesenius, Ewald, Knobel, and Mr. Cheyne). \"No one,\" that is, \"who engaged in a suit, limited himself to just pleas and honest courses in his prosecution of it.\" Nor any pleadeth for truth; rather, none pleadeth in truthfulness. They trust in vanity; literally, in chaos; i.e. \"in a mass of false and vain statements.\" The whole basis of the dealings between man and man was unsound, corrupt, chaotic. Where truth and plain dealing are set aside, all shortly becomes ruin and confusion. They conceive mischief, etc. (comp. Psalm 7:14).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah59:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThey hatch cockatrice' eggs, and weave the spider's web: he that eateth of their eggs dieth, and that which is crushed breaketh out into a viper.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 5. - They hatch cockatrice' eggs. (On the cockatrice, see the comment upon Isaiah 11:8.) The meaning here is that the people gave themselves to brooding on and hatching purposes which were as pernicious and destructive as the eggs of venomous serpents. And weave the spider's web; i.e. \"their purposes were as flimsy and unsubstantial as the web of the spider.\" He that eateth, etc. If a man partake of their plans, he becomes morally as bad as they, and is smitten with spiritual death. If an attempt be made to \"crush\" and destroy their plans, the only result is the premature birth of a viper.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah59:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTTheir webs shall not become garments, neither shall they cover themselves with their works: their works are works of iniquity, and the act of violence is in their hands.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 6. - Their webs shall not become garments. The unsubstantial fabrics which they weave shall not serve them in any way as garments, or be of any real value or utility. Their devices shall not take objective shape in such sort as to afford them \"cover\" or protection. Their works are works of iniquity; rather, works of nothingness, works that make a mere pretence of being works at all, and are in reality mere shams, impotent and delusive. And the act of violence is in their hands; rather, and it is an act of violence that is in their hands. Violence creates nothing. At the best, it destroys.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah59:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTTheir feet run to evil, and they make haste to shed innocent blood: their thoughts are thoughts of iniquity; wasting and destruction are in their paths.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 7. - Their feet run to evil. It is, however, only too true that they have a power to work evil. They cannot construct, their devices fall through, their \"spinning\" is to no purpose; but they can, in a rough and blind way, do enormous mischief. \"Their feet run to evil\" - rush to it at full speed - brook no delay, but hurry on into act. It is an easy thing to shed innocent blood; and those who are conscious of constructive impotence are very apt to seek compensation by doing destructive work, which at least shows that they have a power of some kind. Hence \"Reigns of Terror\" when revolutions are at the last gasp. The strong expressions with respect to shedding innocent blood, used here and in 2 Kings 21:16 and 2 Kings 24:4, seem to imply something like a massacre of the more godly Israelites by the ungodly in Manasseh's time. Wasting and destruction (compare the \"destruction and misery\" of Romans 3:16, which is a quotation of the present passage).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah59:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe way of peace they know not; and there is no judgment in their goings: they have made them crooked paths: whosoever goeth therein shall not know peace.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 8. - The way of peace they know not. They have no desire for \"peace,\" and neither \"seek\" it nor \"ensue\" it (1 Peter 3:11). Peace can only be obtained through righteousness (Isaiah 32:17). There is no judgment in their goings; rather, no justice - no recognition of other men's rights, no endeavour to observe right in their own acts and proceedings (comp. ver. 4; and see also Isaiah 1:17, 21, 23; Isaiah 3:14, 15, etc.). They have made them crooked paths (comp. Proverbs 2:15; Proverbs 10:9; Proverbs 28:6). The way that leadeth to life is straight. They have wandered from it, and made for themselves \"crooked\" paths, which can only lead to destruction. In such paths there neither is nor can be \"peace.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah59:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTTherefore is judgment far from us, neither doth justice overtake us: we wait for light, but behold obscurity; for brightness, but we walk in darkness.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 9-15. - ISRAEL HUMBLY CONFESSES ITS SIN'S TO GOD. Isaiah, anxious to bring the people to confession and amendment, makes humble confession in their name, joining himself with them, as if he had been a participator in their iniquities. Verse 9. - Therefore - i.e. on account of these sins - is judgment far from us; i.e. \"does God refrain from judging our enemies.\" Neither doth justice - i.e. the righting of the wrongs which we suffer at the hands of the heathen - overtake us. We are left by God unavenged, and our enemies are left unpunished on account of our many transgressions. We wait for light. We look for a bright dawn to succeed the night of our trouble; but we wait in vain - the obscurity continues.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah59:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWe grope for the wall like the blind, and we grope as if we had no eyes: we stumble at noonday as in the night; we are in desolate places as dead men.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 10. - We grope for the wall; rather, we grope along the wall (comp. Deuteronomy 28:29; and for the \"blindness that had happened unto Israel\" see above, Isaiah 29:10, 18; Isaiah 35:5; Isaiah 42:16, etc.). We stumble at noonday. It was not that light was really wanting, but they had no eyes to behold it. We are in desolate places; rather, in dark places (Vulgate, Rodiger, Kay, Knobel). The word occurs only in this place, and is of doubtful signification.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah59:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWe roar all like bears, and mourn sore like doves: we look for judgment, but there is none; for salvation, but it is far off from us.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 11. - We roar all like bears; rather, we growl. The verb is used commonly of the \"roaring\" of the sea (Isaiah 17:12; Isaiah 51:15; Jeremiah 6:23; 31:45; 50:42; 51:55); but is applied also to the noise made by a dog (Psalm 59:6, 14). Here it represents the deep murmur of discontent, which alternates with the mournful tones of Israel's despondency - the latter being compared to the melancholy cooing of the dove (see ch. 38:14). We look for judgment, but there is none, etc. The same complaint as in ver. 9, clause 1.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah59:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor our transgressions are multiplied before thee, and our sins testify against us: for our transgressions are with us; and as for our iniquities, we know them;VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 12. - Our transgressions are multiplied before thee; i.e. they are very numerous; and they come \"before God,\" so as to attract his attention and call for his animadversion. Our sins testify against us; i.e. \"rise up against us as witnesses, whose evidence we cannot disprove, and have not even the face to dispute.\" Our transgressions are with us - i.e. \"constantly haunt us\" - and as for our iniquities, we know them; i.e. we are aware of them, we acknowledge them, we have them continually in our memories. It is one of the most certain phenomena of consciousness that grievous sins, deadly sins, haunt the mind, and cannot in this life be wiped out from the memory.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah59:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTIn transgressing and lying against the LORD, and departing away from our God, speaking oppression and revolt, conceiving and uttering from the heart words of falsehood.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 13. - An enumeration of special sins. First, sins of the heart. Transgressing and lying against the Lord; or rather, treason and unfaithfulness to Jehovah (Cheyne); followed by departing away from God, or the secret act of apostasy. Next, sins of the tongue: Speaking oppression and revolt; or, oppression and wrong - the \"wrong,\" probably, of false accusation (comp. Deuteronomy 19:16); and, lastly, conceiving and uttering · . . words of falsehood generally.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah59:14VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd judgment is turned away backward, and justice standeth afar off: for truth is fallen in the street, and equity cannot enter.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 14. - Judgment is turned away backward. In conclusion, the crying sin of perversion of justice is admitted with much amplification.NEWLINENEWLINE(1) Right judgment is exactly inverted - the innocent are condemned, the guilty acquitted.NEWLINENEWLINE(2) Justice standeth afar off - too far off to be able to hear those who make appeal to it.NEWLINENEWLINE(3) Truth is fallen in the street; i.e. false witness prevails over true in the courts of justice.NEWLINENEWLINE(4) Equity cannot enter - is not admitted inside the courts, but waits without.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah59:15VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTYea, truth faileth; and he that departeth from evil maketh himself a prey: and the LORD saw it, and it displeased him that there was no judgment.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 15. - Yea, truth faileth. Truth itself is altogether gone, is missing, not forthcoming. \"Tetras Astraea reliquit.\" This is the worst of all. For truth is the basis of the social fabric, the groundwork of all morality. Once let there be no regard for truth in a state, no discredit attaching to lying, and all virtue is undermined, all soundness is vanished - nothing remains but \"wounds, and bruises, and putrifying sores\" (Isaiah 1:6). He that departeth from evil maketh himself a prey. Evil-doers prosper. The man who \"eschews evil,\" and declines to employ (as others do) the weapons of fraud and violence, simply gives himself over as a prey to those who are less scrupulous than himself. Verses 15-21. - A PROMISE OF DELIVERANCE. TO OPPRESSED ISRAEL. The godly in Israel were suffering a double oppression:NEWLINENEWLINE(1) at the hand of their ungodly brethren;NEWLINENEWLINE(2) at the hand of the heathen.NEWLINENEWLINEThe prophet promises a deliverance from both. The deliverance will be followed by the establishment of Messiah's kingdom, which will continue for ever. Verse 15. And the Lord saw it. The division of the verses here requires alteration. The opening clause of ver. 15 belongs to what precedes; the second clause to what follows. \"The Lord saw\" that condition of things in Israel which is described in vers. 3-15; and it displeased him; literally, it was evil in his eyes, especially in that there was no judgment. Justice was not done between man and man; no one thought of pronouncing just judgments. The circumstances were such as to invite a Divine interposition.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah59:16VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he saw that there was no man, and wondered that there was no intercessor: therefore his arm brought salvation unto him; and his righteousness, it sustained him.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 16. - He saw that there was no man, and wondered that there was no intercessor; i.e. God looked for some champion of the oppressed to arise; it was to be expected under the circumstances. But, alas! \"there was no man.\" None stood up to resist the unrighteous and protect the innocent; much less did any stand up to deliver Israel from its heathen adversaries. When it is said that God \"wondered\" at no champion appearing, we must understand the expression as an anthropomorphism· Therefore his arm brought salvation unto him. As them was no human champion, it became necessary that God should arise in his own Person, and show himself. \"His arm\" and \"his righteousness\" were enough; no human aid was needed, or could have added anything to the resistless strength of his might (comp. Isaiah 63:5).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah59:17VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor he put on righteousness as a breastplate, and an helmet of salvation upon his head; and he put on the garments of vengeance for clothing, and was clad with zeal as a cloke.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 17. - He put on righteousness as a breastplate. The Isaiah anthropomorphism is far less gross than the Homeric. The gods in Homer put on actual armour, and take sword and shield. Jehovah arms himself for the battle in a way that is manifestly metaphoric. He puts on a \"Divine panoply\" - righteousness as his breastplate, salvation as his helmet, vengeance for garments, and zeal, or jealousy, for a cloak. He takes no offensive weapons - \"the out-breathing of his Spirit (ver. 19) is enough\" (Kay).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah59:18VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAccording to their deeds, accordingly he will repay, fury to his adversaries, recompence to his enemies; to the islands he will repay recompence.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 18. - According to their deeds; rather, according to their deserts (comp. Psalm 28:4, ad fin.). He will repay. The ordinary future here, and in the remainder of the prophecy, replaces the \"perfect of prophetic certitude,\" which has been employed in vers. 16, 17. Fury to his adversaries, recompense to his enemies. God's \"adversaries\" are those of his own household - his people, the ungodly Israelites; his \"enemies\" are the heathen that oppress his people (comp. Isaiah 1:24, which is very similar). To the islands; i.e. the maritime lands, which, under Assyria, and afterwards under Babylon, took part in the oppression of his people.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah59:19VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTSo shall they fear the name of the LORD from the west, and his glory from the rising of the sun. When the enemy shall come in like a flood, the Spirit of the LORD shall lift up a standard against him.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 19. - So shall they fear; rather, and they shall fear. The result of the triumphant exhibition of God's might will be a conversion of the Gentiles, who will flock in both from the west - the quarter of \"the islands\" - and from the east, to do reverence to the name and to the glory of the Lord. When the enemy shall come in (rather, come on) like a flood; literally, like the river; i.e. the Euphrates (comp. Isaiah 8:7, \"The Lord bringeth up upon them the waters of the river, strong and many, even the King of Assyria and all his glory,\" etc.). When this shall be the case, then the Spirit of the Lord - hypostasized or nearly so - shall lift up a standard against him (comp. Isaiah 10:18; Zechariah 9:16), and easily vanquish him. The metaphor of \"lifting a standard\" for making an armed resistance is common in Isaiah (Isaiah 5:26; Isaiah 13:2; Isaiah 18:3; Isaiah 31:9, etc.).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah59:20VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the Redeemer shall come to Zion, and unto them that turn from transgression in Jacob, saith the LORD.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 20. - And the Redeemer shall come to Zion; rather, and there shall come a Redeemer for Zion, and for those who turn, etc. When the \"adversaries \"and the \"enemies\" shall have been punished, repentant Israel shall be saved by the coming of Messiah. As usual, the prophet does not note, or perhaps see, intervals of time, but blends events of various periods into one glorious vision of triumphant deliverance, redemption, and prolonged spiritual life in the Redeemer's kingdom.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah59:21VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAs for me, this is my covenant with them, saith the LORD; My spirit that is upon thee, and my words which I have put in thy mouth, shall not depart out of thy mouth, nor out of the mouth of thy seed, nor out of the mouth of thy seed's seed, saith the LORD, from henceforth and for ever.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 21. - As for me; literally, and I. The prophet begins with one construction, and then checks himself, and introduces another. This is my covenant (comp. Jeremiah 31:31-34; and see the comment on Isaiah 53:3). The new covenant involved the giving of God's Spirit to his people (Joel 2:28); and this Spirit, it is here promised, shall not depart from God's people while time endures. The Spirit will be accompanied with certain \"words\" which will be put into the Church's mouth; and these words will remain unchanged and pass on from mouth to mouth, age after age, for ever. The \"words\" intended are probably those of the entire Bible - \"all God's revelations\" (Cheyne) - which the Church will maintain as inspired truth through all ages. Upon thee; i.e. upon Israel. The change of number and person (\"with them... upon thee\") is not unusual in Isaiah (Isaiah 1:29; Isaiah 33:2; Isaiah 49:5; Isaiah 62:11, 12, etc.).NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINE","Isa.5":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah5:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTNow will I sing to my wellbeloved a song of my beloved touching his vineyard. My wellbeloved hath a vineyard in a very fruitful hill:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 1-7. - ISRAEL REBUKED BY THE PARABLE OF A VINEYARD. This chapter stands in a certain sense alone, neither closely connected with what precedes nor with what follows, excepting that it breathes throughout a tone of denunciation. There is also a want of connection between its parts, the allegory of the first section being succeeded by a series of rebukes for sins, expressed in the plainest language, and the rebukes being followed by a threat of punishment, also expressed with plainness. The resemblance of the parable with which the chapter opens to one of those delivered by our Lord, and recorded in the three synoptic Gospels (Matthew 21:33-41; Mark 12:1-9; Luke 20:9-16), has been frequently noticed. Verse 1. - Now will I sing to my Well-beloved. The prophet sings to Jehovah a song concerning his vineyard. The song consists of eight lines, beginning with \"My Well-beloved,\" and ending with \"wild grapes.\" It is in a lively, dancing measure, very unlike the general style of Isaiah's poetry. The name \"Well-beloved\" seems to be taken by the prophet from the Song of Songs, where it occurs above twenty times. It well expresses the feeling of a loving soul towards its Creator and Redeemer. A song of my Well-beloved. Bishop Lowth translates \"A song of loves,\" and Mr. Cheyne \"A love-song;\" but this requires an alteration of the text, and is unsatisfactory from the fact that the song which follows is not a \"love-song.\" May we not understand the words to mean \"a song concerning my Well-beloved in respect of his vineyard?\" Touching his vineyard. Israel is compared to a \"vine\" in the Psalms (Psalm 80:8-16), and the Church of God to a \"garden\" in Canticles (Song of Solomon 4:12; Song of Solomon 5:1); perhaps also to a \"vineyard\" in the same book (Song of Solomon 8:12). Isaiah may have had this last passage in his mind. My Beloved hath a vineyard; rather, had a vineyard (ἀμπελὼν ἑγενήθη τῷ ἠγαπημένῳ, LXX.). In a very fruitful hill. So the passage is generally understood, since keren, horn, is used for a height by the Arabs (as also by the Germans, e.g. Matterhorn, Wetterhorn, Aarhorn, etc.), and \"son of oil\" is a not unlikely Orientalism for \"rich\" or \"fruitful.\" With the \"hill\" of this passage compare the \"mountain\" of Isaiah 2:2, both passages indicating that the Church of God is set on aft eminence, and \"cannot be hid\" (Matthew 5:14).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah5:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he fenced it, and gathered out the stones thereof, and planted it with the choicest vine, and built a tower in the midst of it, and also made a winepress therein: and he looked that it should bring forth grapes, and it brought forth wild grapes.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 2. - He fenced it. So the LXX., the Vulgate, Aben Ezra, Jarchi, Rosenmüller, Lowth, Kay. Gesenius, Knobel, and Mr. Cheyne prefer to translate, \"he dug it over;\" while the Revisers of 1885 have suggested, \"he made a trench about it.\" The word occurs only in this place, and has no cognates in Hebrew. And gathered out the stones (comp. Isaiah 62:10). In the stony soil of Palestine, to collect the surface stones into heaps, or build them into walls, is of primary necessity for the improvement of the land. Conversely the stones were put back, and scattered over the land, by those who wished to \"mar\" it (2 Kings 3:19, 25). Planted it with the choicest vine (comp. Genesis 49:11; Jeremiah 2:21). The sorek seems to have been a particular kind of vine, reckoned superior to others. The etymology of the word indicates that it was of a deep red color. Built a tower (comp. Matthew 21:33). Towers had to be built in gardens, orchards, and vineyards, that watch might be kept from them against thieves and marauders (see 1 Kings 17:9; 1 Kings 18:8; 2 Chronicles 26:10; 2 Chronicles 27:4, etc.). Made a wine-press; literally, dug a winepress. The excavation was made to contain a vat, above which was the \"press,\" worked by men, who wrung the liquor out of a great bag containing the grapes. (See the Egyptian rock-paintings, passim, where the operation is represented repeatedly.) It brought forth wild grapes. The natural, not the cultivated fruit, a worthless product.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah5:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd now, O inhabitants of Jerusalem, and men of Judah, judge, I pray you, betwixt me and my vineyard.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 3. - The prophet's \"song\" here ends, and Jehovah himself takes the word. As if the story told in the parable had been a fact, he calls on the men of Judah and Jerusalem to \"judge between him and his vineyard.\" Compare Nathan's appeal to David by the parable of the ewe lamb (2 Samuel 12:1-4).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah5:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWhat could have been done more to my vineyard, that I have not done in it? wherefore, when I looked that it should bring forth grapes, brought it forth wild grapes?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 4. - What could have been done more? Comp. 2 Kings 17:13 and 2 Chronicles 36:15, where God is shown to have done all that was possible to reclaim his people: \"Yet the Lord testified against Israel, and against Judah, by all the prophets, and all the seers, saying, Turn ye from your evil ways, and keep my commandments and my statutes, according to the Law which I commanded your fathers, and which I sent to you by my servants the prophets;\" \"And the Lord God of their fathers sent unto them by his messengers, rising up early, and sending; because he had compassion on his people, and on his dwelling-place: but they mocked the messengers of God, and despised his words, and misused his prophets, until the wrath of the Lord arose against his people, until there was no remedy.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah5:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd now go to; I will tell you what I will do to my vineyard: I will take away the hedge thereof, and it shall be eaten up; and break down the wall thereof, and it shall be trodden down:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 5. - And now go to; I will tell you; rather, and now, I pray you, let me tell yon. The address is still smooth and persuasive up to the word \"vineyard.\" Then there is a sudden change; the style becomes abrupt, the tone fierce and menacing. \"Let me tell you what I will do to my vineyard: break down its hedge, that it be grazed on; destroy its wall, that it be trampled underfoot,\" etc. The hedge... the wall. Vine-yards were usually protected either by a hedge of thorns, commonly of the prickly pear, or else by a wall; but the rabbis say that in some cases, for additional security, they were surrounded by both. God had given his vineyard all the protection possible.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah5:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd I will lay it waste: it shall not be pruned, nor digged; but there shall come up briers and thorns: I will also command the clouds that they rain no rain upon it.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 6. - I will lay it waste; literally, I will make it a desolation (comp. Isaiah 7:19, where a cognate term occurs). Active ravage is not so much pointed at, as the desolation which comes from neglect. There shall come up briers and thorns. The natural produce of neglected ground in Palestine (see Proverbs 24:31). The \"thorns and briers\" symbolize vices of various kinds, the natural produce of the human soul, if God leaves it to itself. The words are scarcely to be taken literally, though it is probably true that \"no country in the world has such variety and abundance of thorny plants as Palestine in its present desolation\" (Macmillan, 'Min. of Nat.,' p. 103). I will also command the clouds. Here at last disguise is thrown off, and the speaker manifestly appears as Jehovah, who can alone \"command the clouds.\" The \"rain\" intended is probably that of his gracious influences.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah5:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor the vineyard of the LORD of hosts is the house of Israel, and the men of Judah his pleasant plant: and he looked for judgment, but behold oppression; for righteousness, but behold a cry.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 7. - For the vineyard, etc. The full explanation of the parable follows immediately on the disclosure in ver. 6. The vineyard is \"Israel,\" or rather \"Judah;\" the fruit expected from it, \"judgment and righteousness;\" the wild grapes which alone it had produced, \"oppression\" and the \"cry\" of the distressed. His pleasant plan;: literally, the plant of his delights; i.e. the plantation in which he had so long taken delight. He looked for judgment, etc. Gesenius has attempted to give the verbal antithesis of the Hebrew, which is quite lost in our version -NEWLINENEWLINE\"Er harrete auf Recht, und siehe da Unrecht,NEWLINEAuf Gerechtigkeit, und siehe da Schlechtigkeit.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah5:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWoe unto them that join house to house, that lay field to field, till there be no place, that they may be placed alone in the midst of the earth!VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 8-24. - THE SIX WOES. After the general warning conveyed to Israel by the parable of the vineyard, six sins are particularized as those which have especially provoked God to give the warning. On each of these woe is denounced. Two have special punishments assigned to them (vers. 8-17); the remainder are joined in one general threat of retribution (vers. 18 - 24). Verse 8. - Woe unto them that join house to house. This is the first woe. It is pronounced on the greed which leads men to continually enlarge their estates, without regard to their neighbors' convenience. Nothing is said of any use of unfair means, much less of violence in dispossessing the former proprietors. What is denounced is the selfishness of vast accumulations of land in single bands, to the detriment of the rest of the community. The Jewish law was peculiarly inimical to this practice (Numbers 27:1-11; Numbers 33:54; 1 Kings 21:4); but perhaps it is not without reason that many writers of our own time object to it on general grounds. Till there be no place; literally, till want of place; i.e. till there is no room for others. A hyperbole, doubtless, but marking a real national inconvenience. That they may be placed alone in the midst of the earth; rather, that ye may dwell by yourselves in the midst of the land. The great landlords wished to isolate themselves; they disliked neighbors; they would fain \"dwell by themselves,\" without neighbors to trouble them. Uzziah seems, by what is said of his possessions (2 Chronicles 26:10), to have been one of the greatest sinners in respect of the accumulation of land.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah5:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTIn mine ears said the LORD of hosts, Of a truth many houses shall be desolate, even great and fair, without inhabitant.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 9. - Either something has fallen out in the first clause of this verse, or there is a most unusual ellipse of the verb \"said\" which our translators have supplied, very properly. There seems to be nothing emphatic in the words, \"on mine ears\" (see Isaiah 22:14; Ezekiel 9:1, 5; Ezekiel 10:13). Many houses shall be desolate. The greed of adding house to house will be punished by the death of those who have so sinned, and the extinction of their families, either through war, or through a more direct divine judgment.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah5:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTYea, ten acres of vineyard shall yield one bath, and the seed of an homer shall yield an ephah.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 10. - Yea, ten acres of vineyard shall yield one bath. The greed of adding field to field will he punished by the curse of barrenness, which God will send upon the laud. Dr. Kay-calculates that ten acres (Roman) of vineyard ought to yield upon the average five hundred baths (or four thousand gallons) instead of one bath (eight gallons). An homer... an ephah. The \"ephah\" was the tenth-part of a \"homer\" (Ezekiel 45:11). Corn lands should return only one-tenth part of the seed sown in them.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah5:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWoe unto them that rise up early in the morning, that they may follow strong drink; that continue until night, till wine inflame them!VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 11. - Woe unto them that... follow strong drink. We have here the second woe. It is pronounced on drunkenness and revelry. Drunkenness is an infrequent Oriental vice; but it seems to have been one whereto many among the Jews were at all times prone (see Proverbs 20:1; Proverbs 23:29-32; Ecclesiastes 10:17; Hosea 4:11; Isaiah 28:7, etc.). Even the priests and the soi-disant prophets erred through strong drink and were swallowed up of wine\" (Isaiah 28:7). That rise up early in the morning. Great banquets were held by the \"princes\" and \"nobles,\" beginning at an early hour (Ecclesiastes 10:10), and accompanied by music of an exciting kind (Amos 6:5, 6), which were \"continued until night,\" or rather, \"into the night\" (Revised Version), and terminated in general drunkenness, perhaps in general licentiousness. (See Proverbs 23:27-30 and Hosea 4:11 for the connection of inebriety with whoredom.) Two kinds of intoxicating liquor seem to have been consumed at these banquets, viz. ordinary grape wine, and a much stronger drink, which is said to have been \"made of dates, pomegranates, apples, honey, barley, and other ingredients,\" which was known as shekar (Greek, σίκερα), and is called \"strong drink\" in the Authorized Version. Till wine inflame them; or, the wine inflaming them.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah5:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the harp, and the viol, the tabret, and pipe, and wine, are in their feasts: but they regard not the work of the LORD, neither consider the operation of his hands.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 12. - The harp and the viol, the tabret and pipe. It is difficult to identify the Hebrew instruments of music with modern names; but there seems to be no doubt that the kinnor was a sort of harp, and the khalib a sort of pipe. The nebel, generally rendered by \"psaltery,\" but here and in Isaiah 14:11 by \"viol,\" was a stringed instrument played with the fingers (Josephus); perhaps a lyre, perhaps a sort of dulcimer. The toph, here translated \"tabret,\" and elsewhere often \"timbrel,\" was most likely a tambourine. All four instruments had in the earlier times been dedicated to the worship of Jehovah (1 Samuel 10:5); now they were employed to inflame men's passions at feasts. They regard not the work of the Lord. The \"work of Jehovah\" is his manifestation of himself in history, more especially in the history of his chosen people (Deuteronomy 32:4; Psalm 92:4; Psalm 111:3, etc.). A pious Israelite was ever marveling at all that God had done for his nation (Deuteronomy 32:7-14; Joshua 24:2-13; 1 Chronicles 16:12-22; Ezra 9:7-9; Nehemiah 9:7-31; Psalm 68:7-28; Psalm 78:10-72; Psalm 105:5-45; Psalm 106:7-46; Psalm 136:5-24, etc.). The men of Isaiah's generation had ceased to care for things of the past, and devoted themselves to enjoying the present. Neither consider, etc. (comp. Isaiah 1:3, \"My people doth not consider\"). The verb used is not, however, the same in the Hebrew.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah5:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTTherefore my people are gone into captivity, because they have no knowledge: and their honourable men are famished, and their multitude dried up with thirst.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 13. - Therefore my people are gone into captivity. \"Are gone\" or \"have gone\" is \"the perfect of prophetic certainty\" (Cheyne). The prophet sees the captivity as a thing that had already taken place. It as an appropriate punishment for drunkenness and revelry to be carried off into servitude, and in that condition to suffer, as slaves so often did, hunger and thirst. Because they have no knowledge; or, unawares, without foreseeing it (so Rosenmüller, Gesenius, Ewald, Delitzsch, Cheyne). Their honorable men; literally, their glory, for \"their glorious ones\" - the abstract for the concrete. Are famished; literally, sons of famine; i.e. \"starvelings.\" Their multitude; or, their noisy crowd (Kay) - the \"throng of voluptuaries\" who frequented the great banquets of vers. 11, 12.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah5:14VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTTherefore hell hath enlarged herself, and opened her mouth without measure: and their glory, and their multitude, and their pomp, and he that rejoiceth, shall descend into it.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 14. - Therefore hell hath enlarged herself; rather, hath enlarged her desire (comp. Habakkuk 2:5). \"Hell\" here represents the underworld, into which souls descended at death, not yet perhaps recognized as comprehending two divisions, but regarded much as the Greeks regarded their Hades - as a general receptacle of the dead, dark and silent. Hades (Sheol), not viewed as a person, but personified by poetical license, \"enlarges her desire\" and \"opens her mouth\" to receive the crowd that is approaching the crowd of those who in captivity succumb to the hardships of their lot. Their glory; literally, her glory - the glory, i.e., of Jerusalem, which is especially in the prophet's thoughts. \"Her glory, and her crowd, and her pomp, and he that is joyful in her, shall go down\" into the sheol that gapes for them.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah5:15VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the mean man shall be brought down, and the mighty man shall be humbled, and the eyes of the lofty shall be humbled:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 15. - And the mean man, hall be brought down; rather, so the mean man is brought down; i.e. in this way, by the Captivity and the consequent sufferings and deaths, both high and low are brought down and humbled, while God is exalted in man's sight. The future is throughout spoken of as present (comp. Isaiah 2:9, 11, 17).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah5:16VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut the LORD of hosts shall be exalted in judgment, and God that is holy shall be sanctified in righteousness.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 16. - God that is holy shall be sanctified in righteousness; rather, the holy God shows himself holy by righteousness; i.e. by executing this righteous judgment on Jerusalem the holy God shows his holiness.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah5:17VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen shall the lambs feed after their manner, and the waste places of the fat ones shall strangers eat.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 17. Then shall the lambs feed. Dr. Kay takes the \"lambs\" to be the remnant of Israel that survived the judgment, who will feed freely, cared for by the good Shepherd; but the parallelism so generally affected by Isaiah seems to require a meaning more consonant with the later clause of the verse. Most commentators, therefore, expound the passage literally, \"Then shall lambs feed [on the desolated estates of the covetous]\" (see vers. 8-10). After their manner; or, after their own guidance; i.e. at their pleasure, as they list (so Lowth and Rosenmüller). And the waste places of the fat ones shall strangers eat. Goim, i.e. nomad tribes, shall consume the produce of the wasted fields once possessed by the Hebrew grandees. Ewald proposes to make the verse immediately follow ver. 10; but this is not necessary. The occupation of their lands by wandering tribes, Arabs and others, was a part of the punishment that fell on all the nobles, not on those only who accumulated large estates.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah5:18VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWoe unto them that draw iniquity with cords of vanity, and sin as it were with a cart rope:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 18. - Woe unto them, etc. We come here to the third woe, which is pronounced against those who openly pile up sin upon sin, and scoff at God. These men are represented as \"drawing iniquity with cords of vanity,\" i.e. dragging after them a load of sin by cords that seem too weak; and then as \"sinning with a cart-rope,\" which is a mere variant expression of the same idea. Mr. Cheyne quotes from the Rig-Veda, as a parallel metaphor, the phrase, \"Undo the rope of sin.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah5:19VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThat say, Let him make speed, and hasten his work, that we may see it: and let the counsel of the Holy One of Israel draw nigh and come, that we may know it!VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 19. - That say, Let him make speed, etc. Instead of trembling at the coming judgment of God, which Isaiah has announced, they pretend to desire its immediate arrival; they want to \"see it.\" They walk, not by faith, but by sight. At the bottom of this pretended desire there lies a complete incredulity. The counsel; or, purpose, as in Isaiah 14:26. Of the Holy One of Israel. They use one of Isaiah's favorite titles of God (see note on Isaiah L 4), not from any belief in him, but rather in a mocking spirit.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah5:20VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWoe unto them that call evil good, and good evil; that put darkness for light, and light for darkness; that put bitter for sweet, and sweet for bitter!VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 20. - Woe unto them that call evil good. This is the fourth woe. There are persons who gloss over evil deeds and evil habits by fair-sounding names, who call cowardice caution, and rashness courage, niggardliness thrift, and wasteful profusion generosity. The same men are apt also to call good evil; they brand prudence with the name of cunning, call meekness want of proper spirit, sincerity rudeness, and firmness obstinacy. This deadness to moral distinctions is the sign of deep moral corruption, and fully deserves to have a special \"woe\" pronounced against it. That put darkness for light. \"Light\" and \"darkness\" symbolize good and evil throughout Scripture (1 Samuel 2:9; 2 Samuel 22:29; Job 29:3; Psalm 112:4; Proverbs 2:13; Ecclesiastes 2:13; Isaiah 9:2; Matthew 6:22; John 1:19; Acts 26:18; Romans 13:12; 1 Corinthians 4:5, etc.). They are sometimes mere synonyms, as here; but sometimes they express rather the intellectual side of morality. Bitter for sweet. More symbolism, but of a rarer kind. Jeremiah calls wickedness \"bitter\" (Jeremiah 2:9; 4:18), and the psalmist calls the judgments of God\" sweet\" (Psalm 109:103). But the terms are not often used with any moral bearing.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah5:21VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWoe unto them that are wise in their own eyes, and prudent in their own sight!VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 21. - Woe unto them that are wise in their own eyes. The fifth woe. Self-conceit is the antithesis of humility; and as humility is, in a certain sense, the crowning virtue, so self-conceit is a sort of finishing touch put to vice. While a man thinks humbly of himself, there is a chance that he may repent and amend. When he is \"wise in his own eyes,\" he does not see why he should change.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah5:22VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWoe unto them that are mighty to drink wine, and men of strength to mingle strong drink:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 22. - Woe unto them that are mighty to drink wine. The sixth woe seems at first sight a repetition of the second. But there is this difference, that the drinkers in the present verse do not succumb to their liquor, or remain at the banquet all day, but proceed to the business of their lives, attend courts and judge causes, but with brain obfuscated and moral vision bedimmed, so that they are easily induced to pervert justice on receipt of a bribe. The sixth woe may be considered to be pronounced rather upon their corruption than upon their drinking, and so to be really quite distinct from the second (comp. Proverbs 31:4, 5).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah5:23VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWhich justify the wicked for reward, and take away the righteousness of the righteous from him!VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 23. - Justify the wicked; i.e. \"decide his cause in his favor,\" declare him to be right, and his adversary wrong. For reward; or, for a bribe. Take away the righteousness of the righteous; i.e. \"declare him to be in the wrong by deciding his cause against him.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah5:24VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTTherefore as the fire devoureth the stubble, and the flame consumeth the chaff, so their root shall be as rottenness, and their blossom shall go up as dust: because they have cast away the law of the LORD of hosts, and despised the word of the Holy One of Israel.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 24. - Therefore, etc. A general judgment is now pronounced against all the forms of wickedness enumerated - a judgment of ruin or destruction. It is expressed by a mixed metaphor, or \"combination of two figures,\" the former taken from the burning of stubble and withered grass by the farmer when he is cleaning his fields, the latter from the natural decay of a blossoming plant or tree. In either case the destruction is complete, but in the one it arises from an external force, fire; in the other from an internal failure of vitality. The ruin of Israel would include both; it would be brought about by an internal cause, their corruption, and an external one, God's anger. As the fire devoureth the stubble; literally, as a tongue of fire eats up stubble. \"Tongue of fire\" is an unusual phrase, occurring in all Scripture only here and in Acts 2:3. But it well depicts the power of fire to lick up clean all that comes in its way. Isaiah elsewhere notes the analogy, making it the foundation of simile (Isaiah 30:27). And the flame consumeth the chaff; rather, and as dry grass sinks down inflame. The withered grass of pastures was burnt by farmers to improve the after-growth (Lucan, 'Pharsal.,' 9:182). Their root shall be as rottenness (comp. Hosea 9:16). The root is the last thing to decay. When that fails, the case is desperate. Judah's \"root\" did not utterly fail (see Isaiah 11:1); but the present warning is to individuals and classes (vers. 8, 11, 18, 20-23), not to the nation. Their blossom shall go up as dust; i.e. their external glory shall crumble and waste away. Because they have cast away the Law. All the sins of Israel had this one thing in common - they were transgressions of the Law of God as delivered to them by Moses, and enforced upon them by the prophetical order (comp. 2 Kings 17:13-16). Despised the word; or, the speech. Imrah is rarely used by Isaiah. It does not refer to the written \"Word,\" but to the declarations of God by the mouth of his prophets (see Isaiah 28:23; Isaiah 32:9).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah5:25VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTTherefore is the anger of the LORD kindled against his people, and he hath stretched forth his hand against them, and hath smitten them: and the hills did tremble, and their carcases were torn in the midst of the streets. For all this his anger is not turned away, but his hand is stretched out still.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 25-30. - THE NATURE OF THE COMING JUDGMENT EXPLAINED. Hints have been already given that the judgment which is to fall on the nation is a foreign war, or a series of foreign wars (see Isaiah 3:25; Isaiah 5:13). But now for the first time a terrible invasion, in which many nations will participate, is clearly announced. At first the imagery is obscure (ver. 25), but it soon grows more distinct. \"Nations\" are summoned to the attack; a vast army comes, and comes\" with speed swiftly\" (ver. 26); then their array is described (vers. 27, 28); and finally their ravin is compared to that of lions, and their success in catching and carrying off their prey is prophesied (ver. 29). In the last verse of the chapter the prophet falls back into vaguer imagery, comparing the roar of the invaders to the roaring of the sea, and the desolated land to one seen under the gloom of a preternatural darkness (ver. 30). Verse 25. - The threats of this verse are all vague and general, for there is no reason to suppose that the phrase,\" the hills did tremble, \"refers to an actual earthquake. That there was an earthquake in the reign of Uzziah is, indeed, clear from Amos 1:1; but it was probably a thing of the past when Isaiah wrote this chapter, and he is spiking of the future. A \"trembling of the hills\" is, in prophetic language, a commotion among the chief men of the land. He hath stretched forth his hand. Again the \"perfect of prophetic certitude.\" Their carcasses were torn; rather, were as refuse (comp. Lamentations 3:45). There would be many slain, and lying unburied, in the streets of Jerusalem. For all this, etc. (comp. Isaiah 9:12, 17, 21, and Isaiah 10:4, where the same words are used as a refrain). The words imply that God's judgment upon Judah will not be a single stroke, but a continuous smiting, covering some considerable space of time.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah5:26VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he will lift up an ensign to the nations from far, and will hiss unto them from the end of the earth: and, behold, they shall come with speed swiftly:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 26. - And he will lift up an ensign. Mr. Cheyne translates, \"a signal,\" and would so render the Hebrew word in Isaiah 11:10, 12; Isaiah 13:2; Isaiah 18:3; Isaiah 49:22; Isaiah 62:10. But \"ensigns\" or \"standards\" were in use both among the Egyptians (Rosellini, 'Monumenti Civili,' pl. 121.) and among the Assyrians ('Ancient Monarchies,' vol. 1. p. 461) before the time of Isaiah, and are, therefore, likely to have been in use among the Hebrews. The standards, however, of this early period were not flags, as Jarchi supposes, but solid constructions of wood or metal, exhibiting some emblem or other. God lifts up his standard to draw the nations together, indicating thereby that they are to fight his battles. And will hiss. \"Hissing\" is said to have been practiced by bee-keepers to draw their bees out of the hives in the morning, and bring them home again from the fields at nightfall (Cyril, ad loc.). God will collect an army against Israel, as such persons collect their bees (comp. Isaiah 7:18). From the end of the earth; i.e. \"to bring them from the end of the earth.\" The nations are, or at least many of them are, extremely distant, as Elamites from the Persian Gulf (Isaiah 22:6), and perhaps Medes from beyond Zagros. They shall come; literally, he cometh; showing that, though the nations are many, they are united under one head, which here is probably the Assyrian power. With speed swiftly (comp. Joel 3:4). The reference is not so much to the speed with which the Assyrians marched, as to the immediate response which they would make to God's call,NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah5:27VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTNone shall be weary nor stumble among them; none shall slumber nor sleep; neither shall the girdle of their loins be loosed, nor the latchet of their shoes be broken:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 27. - None shall be weary nor stumble.

They shall scarcely give themselves time for necessary repose.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah5:28VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWhose arrows are sharp, and all their bows bent, their horses' hoofs shall be counted like flint, and their wheels like a whirlwind:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 28. - Whose arrows are sharp, and all their bows bent. The special weapon of the Assyrian soldiers is the bow. From the king in his chariot to the light-armed recruit just pressed into the service, all fight mainly with this weapon, more particularly in the earlier times (see 'Ancient Monarchies,' vol. 1. pp. 414, 423, 424-437, etc.). Swords and spears are also known, but comparatively little used. Their horses' hoofs... like flint. Hard, strong, and solid, as was most necessary when shoeing was unknown. Their wheels like a whirlwind. Sennacherib (Isaiah 37:24) is represented as boasting of the \"multitude of his chariots;\" and both the sculptures and the inscriptions of Assyria show that the chariot throe was numerous, and was regarded as more important than any other. The king always went to battle in a chariot. For the comparison of the rush of chariot-wheels to a whirlwind, see below, Isaiah 66:15; and comp. Jeremiah 4:13).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah5:29VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTTheir roaring shall be like a lion, they shall roar like young lions: yea, they shall roar, and lay hold of the prey, and shall carry it away safe, and none shall deliver it.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 29. - Their roaring shall be like a lion; rather, like a lioness, which the Hebrews appear to have regarded as fiercer than a lion (see Genesis 44:9; Numbers 24:9; Habakkuk 2:11). The Assyrian armies probably advanced to the combat with loud shouts and yells (see Jeremiah 2:15). Yea, they shall roar; rather, growl. The word is different from the one used previously, and may express the \"deep growl\" with which the lion springs upon his prey (see Dr. Kay's note, ad loc.). Shall carry it away safe. Sennacherib says in one of his inscriptions, that he carried off to Nineveh 200, 150 captives on his first expedition against Jerusalem (Oppert, 'Inscriptions des Sargonides,' pp. 45, 46).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah5:30VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd in that day they shall roar against them like the roaring of the sea: and if one look unto the land, behold darkness and sorrow, and the light is darkened in the heavens thereof.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 30. - Like the roaring of the sea. Not content with one simile, the prophet has recourse to a second. \"The noise of the Assyrian army shall be like that of a raging sea;\" or, perhaps, \"After he has carried off his prey, the Assyrian shall still continue to growl and threaten, like a stormy sea.\" If one look unto the land, etc. If Israel turn its gaze from Assyria to its own land, it sees nothing but a dark prospect - darkness and distress, all light shrouded amid clouds and deep obscurity. The text and the construction are, both of them, uncertain; but the general meaning can scarcely be other than this.NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINE","Isa.60":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah60:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTArise, shine; for thy light is come, and the glory of the LORD is risen upon thee.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 1. - Arise, shine. The subject of the address does not distinctly appear until ver. 14, where it is found to be \"the city of the Lord, the Zion of the Holy One of Israel.\" Zion has long been prostrate in the dust from the prophet's standpoint, and covered with thick darkness. Now she is bidden to \"arise\" and \"shine forth as the day.\" For thy light is come. Zion cannot shine with her own light, for she has no light of her own, having preferred to \"walk in darkness\" (Isaiah 59:9). But she may reflect the radiance which streams from the Person of Jehovah, whose glory is risen upon her. \"In thy light shall we see light\" (Psalm 36:9).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah60:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor, behold, the darkness shall cover the earth, and gross darkness the people: but the LORD shall arise upon thee, and his glory shall be seen upon thee.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 2. - For, behold, the darkness shall cover the earth. As in Egypt a \"thick darkness\" covered the whole land at the word of Moses (Exodus 10:22), while still \"the children of Israel had light in their dwellings,\" so now the world and \"the nations' of the world lay in a deep obscurity, into which scarcely a ray of light penetrated, while on Israel there dawned a glory which streamed from the throne of God, and at once transfigured her, and gave her the appearance of an angel of the Most High. In the radiance of this light she was to stand up and show herself, and then great results would follow.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah60:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the Gentiles shall come to thy light, and kings to the brightness of thy rising.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 3. - The Gentiles shall come to thy light. Plunged in darkness themselves (ver. 2), the Gentiles shall be astonished and attracted by Israel's radiance, and shall draw near to it and seek to partake of it.

These would be composed of merchants from Midian and Ephah, and would bring goods from Sheba. The Midianite caravans of camels are mentioned as early as the time of Jacob, when they carried \"spicery and balm and myrrh\" from the land of Gilead into Egypt (Genesis 37:25, 28, 36). Ephah is a sub-tribe of Midian (Genesis 25:4). These nomads would visit the distant Sheba, in Happy Arabia, for purposes of trade, and would procure there gold and incense, which they would convey to Palestine. The \"Sheba\" intended is doubtless that whose queen visited Solomon, and brought with her gold in abundance, and \"of spices very great store, and precious stones\" (1 Kings 10:10). The Egyptians appear to have called the kingdom of the Shebaim (Sabaeans) \"Punt,\" and to have traded with it from a very early time, especially for frankincense (' Records of the Past,' vol. 10. pp. 14-19; Rawlinson, 'History of Ancient Egypt,' vol. it. pp. 132-134, 221-224). The dromedaries; rather, the young camels, or the camel colts. All they from Sheba shall come; rather, they (i.e. the camels of Midian and Ephah) shall come all together from Sheba.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah60:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAll the flocks of Kedar shall be gathered together unto thee, the rams of Nebaioth shall minister unto thee: they shall come up with acceptance on mine altar, and I will glorify the house of my glory.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 7. - Kedar... Nebaioth. Arab tribes, like the Midianites and Sabaeans. (With respect to Kedar, see the comment on Isaiah 21:15.) \"Nebaioth\" stands for the tribe called by the Greeks and Romans the \"Nabataeans,\" and by the Assyrians the \"Nabaiti,\" who were one of the most powerful in the peninsula. About B.C. 645 Nathan, their king, warred with Asshur-bani-pal (Smith's' Hist. of Asshur-bani-pal,' pp. 256-298). During the Maccabee period we find the Nabataeans in alliance with the Jews, and giving them some valuable assistance (1 Macc. 5:25 1 Macc. 9:35). The locality of the Nabataeans was northern Arabia, or the tract lying between the Elanitic Gulf and the Lower Euphrates. The wealth of the Nabataeans and the Kedarenes was in their flocks and herds; and this wealth, it is prophesied, they will place, at the disposal of Israel. Mine altar... the house of my glory. The renovated Zion contains a glorious temple, and the temple has in it an altar, to which the sheep and rams are brought - not, however, to be offered in sacrifice, but to be presented to God and become a part of the wealth of the Church.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah60:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWho are these that fly as a cloud, and as the doves to their windows?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 8. - Who are these, etc.? The prophet beholds the waters of the Mediterranean Sea covered with numerous ships, whose sails remind him of white clouds moving across the blue expanse of heaven, and again of doves wending their way homewards to their accustomed dove-cotes. The \"windows\" of the dove-cotes are the openings through which the birds pass into the towers where they breed.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah60:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTSurely the isles shall wait for me, and the ships of Tarshish first, to bring thy sons from far, their silver and their gold with them, unto the name of the LORD thy God, and to the Holy One of Israel, because he hath glorified thee.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 9. - Surely the isles shall wait for me. The \"isles,\" or maritime countries of the West, have long waited for a Redeemer (Isaiah 41:1; Isaiah 42:4; Isaiah 49:1; Isaiah 51:5, etc.). They shall send their sons, and their gifts, in ships, which will come from far, and cover the Mediterranean (see the preceding verse). The ships of Tarshish. Either ships belonging to the people of Tartessus, in Spain, who had a widely extended commerce in ancient times (Herod., 1:163; 4:152; 1 Kings 10:22; Ezekiel 27:12; Jonah 1:3; etc.), or ships of a peculiar class, such as were considered suitable for the long and dangerous voyage to the distant Western port (see the comment on Isaiah 2:16). To bring thy sons from far (see the comment on ver. 4). Unto the Name of the Lord; i.e. \"to the place where the Lord has set his Name\" (comp. Isaiah 18:7).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah60:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the sons of strangers shall build up thy walls, and their kings shall minister unto thee: for in my wrath I smote thee, but in my favour have I had mercy on thee.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 10-14. - The third stanza. Zion's reconstruction. Verse 10. - The sons of strangers shall build up thy walls. Cyrus aided in the supply of timber for the construction of the second temple (Ezra 3:7). Artaxerxes Longimanus sanctioned the rebuilding of the wall of Jerusalem (Nehemiah 1:3; Nehemiah 2:5-8). The passage has, however, a meaning beyond the literal one. \"Strangers\" of all kinds, Greeks, and Romans, and Syrians, and Africans, and Cauls, and Spaniards, and others, assisted in building and enlarging the walls of the Church as it spread over the world, set up its bulwarks in the Creeds, and fenced it round about with various decrees and canons. Their kings shall minister unto thee (see the comment on ver. 3). Among ministrant kings may be mentioned Cyrus, Darius the son of Hystaspes, Artaxerxes Longimanus, Alexander the Great, Constantine, Theodosius, Charlemagne, St. Louis, etc. I had mercy on thee. A preterit of prophetic certitude. Mr. Cheyne translates, \"I will have compassion upon thee.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah60:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTTherefore thy gates shall be open continually; they shall not be shut day nor night; that men may bring unto thee the forces of the Gentiles, and that their kings may be brought.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 11. - Thy gates shall be open continually. That all who seek salvation may have free access at all times. There is no fear of enemies entering, since war has ceased (Isaiah 2:4; Isaiah 11:9, etc.). The forces of the Gentiles; rather, the wealth of the Gentiles, as in ver. 5. That their kings may be brought; i.e. forced to come by their subjects, who know that their own prosperity is involved in complete submission to the Church established in Zion, and therefore compel their kings to come and render their homage in person.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah60:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor the nation and kingdom that will not serve thee shall perish; yea, those nations shall be utterly wasted.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 12. - The nation... that will not serve thee shall perish. God's curse shall be upon them; they shall wither and decay for lack of the Divine favour and of the graces which God dispenses to mankind through his Church (comp.

Isaiah 35:2; Isaiah 41:19). Considered as imagery, the representation is that the barren hills which stand about Jerusalem shall, in the new state of things, be decked with tall and beautiful forest trees, all the sylvan scenery of Lebanon being transported to Southern Palestine, so as to encompass the city of God with a garden as delightful as that of Eden. The spiritual meaning is that graces of all kinds shall abound in and around the holy city, and shall make it beautiful and glorious. The fir tree, the pine tree, and the box together (comp. Isaiah 41:19, where the same words occur in the same order; and, for the trees intended, see the comment on that passage). To beautify the place of my sanctuary. Not with \"avenues of cedars and plane trees leading up to it\" (Delitzsch), which was a style of ornamentation quite unknown to the lie-brews; but with groves, and thickets, and sylvan glades, and wooded slopes all around it, as round the Syrian temples in the Lebanon. The place of my feet. The Jewish temple, as the special place of God's presence upon earth, was frequently termed \"God's footstool\" (1 Chronicles 28:2; Psalm 99:5; Psalm 132:7; Lamentations 2:1). He that towers above the heavens had there set his foot. The metaphor is transferred to the renovated Zion.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah60:14VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe sons also of them that afflicted thee shall come bending unto thee; and all they that despised thee shall bow themselves down at the soles of thy feet; and they shall call thee, The city of the LORD, The Zion of the Holy One of Israel.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 14. - The sons (i.e. descendants) also of them that afflicted thee; i.e. of the various nations that at different times oppressed and afflicted Israel - as Egyptians, Canaanites, Philistines, Assyrians, Babylonians, Edomites, Moabites, Ammonites, etc. Shall come bending unto thee. Bowing themselves down to the new Israel - the Israel of God - as the eleven sheaves bowed themselves down to Joseph's sheaf (Genesis 37:7). At the soles of thy feet (comp. Isaiah 49:23). Shall call thee, The city of the Lord. Hitherto her enemies had bestowed on Jerusalem disparaging names, as \"Forsaken,\" or \"Desolate\" (Isaiah 62:4). Now they will substitute for such names titles of honour, such as \"City of Jehovah,\" \"Zion of Israel's Holy One.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah60:15VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWhereas thou hast been forsaken and hated, so that no man went through thee, I will make thee an eternal excellency, a joy of many generations.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 15-18. - The fourth stanza, Zion's prosperity. Verse 15. - Thou hast been forsaken and hated (comp. Isaiah 54:7; Isaiah 62:4). Zion has been a wife repudiated for her adulteries, \"forsaken\" by her husband, and the object of his just \"hate.\" So that no man went through thee. The mixed metaphor is awkward, but readily intelligible. Zion is at once a city and a wife. As a wife, she is \"hated and forsaken,\" as a city, no man goes through her. An eternal excellency (comp. Isaiah 59:21, and see the Homiletics on the passage).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah60:16VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThou shalt also suck the milk of the Gentiles, and shalt suck the breast of kings: and thou shalt know that I the LORD am thy Saviour and thy Redeemer, the mighty One of Jacob.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 16. - Thou shalt also suck the milk of the Gentiles (comp. Deuteronomy 33:19). As a child at the mother's breast, thou shall obtain kindly nourishment through the means of the Gentiles, who acknowledge thee for their superior, and place all their means at thy disposal (supra, vers. 5-11). Among these, the most liberal, and the most prompt to render aid, will be their kings (see the comment on ver. 10). Thou shall know that I the Lord am thy Saviour. This clause is repeated from Isaiah 49:26. It is a phrase containing in it a mysterious depth of promise.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah60:17VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor brass I will bring gold, and for iron I will bring silver, and for wood brass, and for stones iron: I will also make thy officers peace, and thine exactors righteousness.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 17. - For brass I will bring gold; rather, for copper. \"Brass\" was an alloy little known to the Oriental nations. The general idea is that the glorious age of Solomon would return (1 Kings 10:21, 27), and Zion be as resplendent and as wealthy as in his time. The material splendour is, no doubt, throughout the whole description, typical in the main of spiritual glories and excellences. I will also make thy officers peace, and thine exactors righteousness. \"Peace\" and \"righteousness\" are here personified; and the declaration is that they shall bear rule in the community whereof the prophet is speaking (comp, Isaiah 32:16, 17).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah60:18VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTViolence shall no more be heard in thy land, wasting nor destruction within thy borders; but thou shalt call thy walls Salvation, and thy gates Praise.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 18. - Violence shall no more be heard in thy land (comp. Isaiah 2:4; Isaiah 11:6-9; Isaiah 35:9). The entire cessation of war and violence is one of the most characteristic features of the \"last times,\" when swords shall be beaten into ploughshares, and spears into pruning-hooks. \"The Prince of Peace\" shall ultimately establish peace. It is not surprising that men of earnest religious feeling should have thought, at various times, that they saw the actual commencement of the reign of peace upon earth, so distinctly promised, so earnestly longed for, so necessary for the happiness of mankind. But to a calm and dispassionate observer the nineteenth century seems scarcely more advanced upon the road which leads to this desirable end than the first. Thou shall call thy walls Salvation, and thy gates Praise. The true wall of the city will be the \"salvation\" of which God assures it, and the true gates will be the \"praise,\" or renown, which it has among the nations of the earth (comp. Isaiah 26:1).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah60:19VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe sun shall be no more thy light by day; neither for brightness shall the moon give light unto thee: but the LORD shall be unto thee an everlasting light, and thy God thy glory.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 19-22. - The fifth stanza. Zion's crowning glories. Verse 19. - The sun shall be no more thy light by day. Here Isaiah anticipates one of the most sublime thoughts in the Revelation of St. John the Divine, viz. that the heavenly Jerusalem, illuminated perpetually by the radiance of the Divine Presence, shall need neither light of the sun by day, nor of the moon by night, but shall be sufficiently illumined by the direct and primary light which streams down upon it from God himself. Whether the sun and moon will continue to exist or not is beyond the prophet's ken - he makes no announcement on the subject; sufficient for him that the redeemed bask perpetually in a Divine radiance shed upon them by the \"Father of lights\" (see Revelation 21:23; Revelation 22:5). The germ of the idea appears in the earlier prophecies (Isaiah 24:23). For brightness; rather, for illumination. The Lord shall be unto thee an everlasting light. God is \"the Father of lights\" (James 1:17) - \"the true Light, which lighteth every man that cometh into the world.\" (John 1:9). All other light is but his shadow and his reflex - his creature (Genesis 1:3) - therefore perishable, not to be reckoned on for continuance (Psalm 102:26; Hebrews 1:11). But God abides; therefore his light will abide. He is \"the same yesterday, and to-day, and for ever\" (Hebrews 13:8). And thy God thy glory (comp. Zechariah 2:5). God will not only be the Light of the Church, but her \"Glory\" and boast. As the Shechinah was the glory of the first, so \"the eternal unchangeable light of Jehovah, with its peaceful gentleness and perfect purity\" (Delitzsch), will be the glory of the final temple.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah60:20VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThy sun shall no more go down; neither shall thy moon withdraw itself: for the LORD shall be thine everlasting light, and the days of thy mourning shall be ended.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 20. - Thy sun... thy moon. That which is to thee instead of sun and moon - Jehovah's brightness. The days of thy mourning shall be ended. Till the new Jerusalem descends from heaven (Revelation 21:2), and Christ reigns personally over his people (Revelation 22:5), the Church is always, more or less, in a state of mourning. The Bridegroom is away (Matthew 9:15); his light shines upon his Church only by snatches; his Church feels itself unworthy of him - cold, unloving, stained with sin. Fasting, weeping, and mourning befit such a state of things. But in the final condition of the redeemed their mourning shall be ended, \"sorrow and sighing shall have fled away\" (Isaiah 35:10); God shall have \"wiped away all tears from their eyes\" (Revelation 21:4); \"There shall be no more death\" (Revelation 21:4); \"no more curse\" (Revelation 22:3); \"neither sorrow, nor crying; neither shall there be any more pain: for the former things are passed away\" (Revelation 21:4). The days of mourning shall be ended.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah60:21VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThy people also shall be all righteous: they shall inherit the land for ever, the branch of my planting, the work of my hands, that I may be glorified.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 21. - Thy people also shall be all righteous. Here the prophet touches the root of the matter. Pain and sorrow are the fruit of sin. Once let sin disappear, and sorrow goes with it. It is the foundation of all the glory and all the happiness of the redeemed in their Lord's final kingdom, that they are cleansed from all defilement of sin, and \"are as the angels\" (Mark 12:25). They shall inherit the land; rather, the earth - the \"new heavens and new earth\" of Isaiah:17; 66:22. The branch of my planting; rather, a sprout of my planting; i.e. a sprout which I have planted.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah60:22VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTA little one shall become a thousand, and a small one a strong nation: I the LORD will hasten it in his time.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 22. - A little one; i.e. the \"little flock\" of our Lord's own time on earth (Luke 12:32), will become a strong nation - a countless multitude (Revelation 7:9). In his time; rather, in its time, when the time fixed in God's counsels for the final establishment of Christ's kingdom arrives.NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINE","Isa.61":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah61:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe Spirit of the Lord GOD is upon me; because the LORD hath anointed me to preach good tidings unto the meek; he hath sent me to bind up the brokenhearted, to proclaim liberty to the captives, and the opening of the prison to them that are bound;VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 1-3. - THE MISSION OF THE SERVANT OF THE LORD. The words of our Lord in Luke 4:21, \"This day is this Scripture fulfilled in your ears,\" preclude the application of this passage to any other than the Lord himself. It is simply astonishing that some Christian commentators (Ewald, Hitzig, Knobel) have not seen the force of this argument, but, with the Jews, imagine the prophet to be speaking of his own ministry. It is contrary to the entire spirit of Isaiah's writings so to glorify himself, and specially unsuitable that, after having brought forward with such emphasis the Person of \"the Servant\" (Isaiah 42:1-8; Isaiah 49:1-12; Isaiah 1:4-9; Isaiah 52:13-15; Isaiah 53:1-12), he should proceed to take his place, and to \"ascribe to himself those very same official attributes which he has already set forth as characteristic features in his portrait of the predicted One\" (Delitzsch). Hence most recent commentators, whatever their school of thought, have acquiesced in the patristic interpretation, which regarded the Servant of Jehovah as here speaking of himself. Verse 1. - The Spirit of the Lord God is upon me; literally, the Spirit of the Lord Jehovah (Adonai Jehovah) is upon me. The Septuagint, the Vulgate, and one manuscript omit adonai. In the original announcement of \"the Servant\" it was stated that God had \"put his Spirit upon him\" (Isaiah 42:1). The sanctification of our Lord's human nature by the Holy Spirit is very explicitly taught in the Gospels (Matthew 1:20; Matthew 3:16; Matthew 4:1, etc.; Mark 1:10, 12; Luke 1:35; Luke 2:40; Luke 3:22; Luke 4:1, 14, 18-21, etc.; John 1:32, 33; John 3:34, etc.). The Lord hath anointed me. The \"anointing\" of Jesus was that sanctification of his human nature by the Holy Spirit, which commenced in the womb of the blessed Virgin (Luke 1:35), which continued as he grew to manhood (Luke 2:40, 52), which was openly manifested at his baptism, and never ceased till he took his body and soul with him into heaven. Of this spiritual anointing, all material unction, whether under the Law (Leviticus 8:10-12, 30; 1 Samuel 10:1; 1 Samuel 16:13; 1 Kings 1:39; 1 Kings 19:15, 16, etc.) or under the gospel (Mark 6:13; James 5:14), was symbolical or typical. To preach good tidings (comp. Isaiah 40:9; Isaiah 41:27; Isaiah 52:7; and Nahum 1:15). Unto the meek (see Matthew 5:5; Matthew 11:29; and comp. Isaiah 11:4; Isaiah 29:19). To bind up the broken-hearted (comp. Psalm 147:3, where this is declared to be the office of Jehovah himself). \"Binding up\" is an ordinary expression in Isaiah's writings for \"healing\" (see Isaiah 1:6; Isaiah 3:7; Isaiah 30:26). To proclaim liberty to the captives. This was one of the special offices of \"the Servant\" (see Isaiah 42:7). The \"captivity\" intended is doubtless that of sin. And the opening of the prison to them that are bound. St. Luke, following the Septuagint, has, \"and recovering of sight to the blind.\" It is thought by some that the original Hebrew text has been corrupted. Others regard the Septuagint rendering as a paraphrase.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah61:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTTo proclaim the acceptable year of the LORD, and the day of vengeance of our God; to comfort all that mourn;VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 2. - To proclaim the acceptable year of the Lord. An \"acceptable year,\" or \"year of acceptance,\" is a space of time during which God would be pleased to accept such as repented and turned to him. It is, of course, not intended to limit the space to a \"year.\" The space is rather the term of our sojourn here below. The day of vengeance. The \"day\" of vengeance is contrasted with the \"year\" of acceptance, to indicate God's long-suffering and patience towards sinners (comp. Isaiah 34:8; and see also Exodus 20:5, 6). To comfort all that mourn; i.e. all who \"sorrow after a godly sort\" (2 Corinthians 7:11) - all who mourn their transgressions and shortcomings, their \"sins, negligences, and ignorances,\" with a hearty desire to be rid of them, and to serve God truly in the future.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah61:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTTo appoint unto them that mourn in Zion, to give unto them beauty for ashes, the oil of joy for mourning, the garment of praise for the spirit of heaviness; that they might be called trees of righteousness, the planting of the LORD, that he might be glorified.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 3. - To appoint... to give. The latter expression is a correction of the former, which was not wide enough. Messiah is sent to give to the godly mournersNEWLINENEWLINE(1) beauty for ashes; or \"a crown for ashes,\" i.e. a crown of glory in lieu of the ashes of repentance which it was customary to sprinkle upon the head;NEWLINENEWLINE(2) the oil of joy for mourning; or the anointing of the Spirit in lieu of that plenteousness of tears which naturally belonged to mourners; andNEWLINENEWLINE(3) the garment of praise for the spirit of heaviness, or a glad heart inclined to praise God, in lieu of a heavy one inclined to despair. Christian experience witnesses to the abundant accomplishment of all these purposes. That they might be called trees of righteousness; literally, oaks of righteousness, or strong and enduring plants in the garden of God, planted by him, in order that through them he might be glorified. Nothing gives so much glory to God as the proved righteousness of his saints. The planting of the Lord; i.e. \"which he has planted\" and caused to grow, and rendered righteous. The righteousness, though it is their own, an indwelling quality, has nevertheless come from him (comp. Isaiah 60:21).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah61:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd they shall build the old wastes, they shall raise up the former desolations, and they shall repair the waste cities, the desolations of many generations.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 4-9. - GOD'S PURPOSE OF DEALING GRACIOUSLY WITH ISRAEL. Having proclaimed the objects of his own mission, \"the Servant\" proceeds to declare God's gracious purposes towards Israel. Taking the Captivity period for his standpoint, he promises, first, the restoration of the cities of Judah (ver. 4), and then a flourishing time in which Jews and Gentiles shall dwell together in one community peacefully and gloriously, Israel having a certain pre-eminence (vers. 5-9). Verse 4. - They shall build the old wastes. (On the \"waste\" condition, not of Jerusalem only, but of the cities of Judith generally, see Isaiah 44:26; Isaiah 49:8, 19; Isaiah 64:10, 11, etc.) The first step in the recovery of Israel from the misery of the Captivity would be a return to Palestine, and a general restoration of the ruined towns. It was a ruin of \"many generations,\" having commenced, probably, with the invasion of Pharaoh-Necho in B.C. 608, and being continued till the edict of Cyrus ( B.C. 538).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah61:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd strangers shall stand and feed your flocks, and the sons of the alien shall be your plowmen and your vinedressers.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 5. - Strangers shall stand and feed your flocks (comp. Isaiah 14:1, 2; Isaiah 45:14; Isaiah 60:10). The Gentiles who join themselves with the Jews, and form with them one community, are constantly represented in the writings of Isaiah as occupying a subordinate position. In the New Testament, Jew and Gentile are put upon a par. Is the explanation that Isaiah assumes that the Jews generally will accept the gospel, and therefore, to some extent, retain their privileges in the new community, whereas, in fact, they rejected the gospel, and so lost their natural position (see Romans 11:7-20)? Or does Isaiah look onward to a later date? And is there to be a restoration of \"Israel according to the flesh\" upon their conversion, and a reinstatement of them in a position of privilege? Such a condition of things seems glanced at in Romans 11:23-29, and in Revelation 7:4-9; Revelation 14:1. The sons of the alien shall be your ploughmen and your vinedressers. Not so much compelled, like the Gibeonites (Joshua 9:21-27), to perform menial offices, as undertaking them voluntarily out of good will.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah61:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut ye shall be named the Priests of the LORD: men shall call you the Ministers of our God: ye shall eat the riches of the Gentiles, and in their glory shall ye boast yourselves.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 6. - But ye shall be named the Priests of the Lord. By the covenant made at Sinai, Israel was to be \"a kingdom of priests, and an holy nation\" (Exodus 19:6). Had they risen to the height of their calling when our Lord and his disciples offered them salvation before offering it to the Gentiles, they might have \"been in the midst of the heathen who had entered into the congregation of Jehovah and become the people of God, what the Aaronites farmerly were in the midst of Israel itself\" (Delitzsch). Will they ever now obtain this position? Ye shall eat the riches of the Gentiles (comp. Isaiah 60:5-9 and 16). The Gentiles, when they came in, would freely offer to the Church of their substance.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah61:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor your shame ye shall have double; and for confusion they shall rejoice in their portion: therefore in their land they shall possess the double: everlasting joy shall be unto them.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 7. - For your shame ye shall have double. Instead of the shame and confusion of face which were the portion of Israel during the Captivity (see Isaiah 51:7, 23; Isaiah 54:4; Daniel 9:7, 8, etc.), they should after their restoration to Palestine \"have double\" their former glory and double their former territory. An increase of territory had been already prophesied (Isaiah 49:18-21) - an increase which, however, was not so much an extension of the bounds of Palestine as a spread of the Church over the whole earth (comp. Zechariah 9:12). For confusion; rather, as for disgrace. So far from feeling disgraced, they will rejoice, or exult, in their portion; i.e. in the territory assigned them. It will be ample; and their life in it will be one of everlasting joy. The speaker passes on in his thought to the time of the \"new heavens and the new earth,\" which he regards as continuous with that of Israel's return.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah61:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor I the LORD love judgment, I hate robbery for burnt offering; and I will direct their work in truth, and I will make an everlasting covenant with them.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 8. - For I the Lord love judgment. Either \"the Servant\" here identifies himself with Jehovah, or he cites a declaration of Jehovah which he has authority to announce. Jehovah will restore the Israelites to their land because he \"loves judgment\" (equivalent to \"justice\") and hates injustice. The Babylonian conquest, though a judgment sent by him, is, so far as the Babylonians are concerned, a wrong and a \"robbery.\" I hate robbery for burnt offering; rather, I hate robbery with wickedness (comp. Job 5:16; Psalm 58:3; Psalm 64:7; 92:16). The transplantation of nations was a gross abuse of the rights of conquest. I will direct their work in truth; rather, I will give them their recompense faithfully. As they have been wronged, they shall be righted; they shall be faithfully and exactly compensated for what they have suffered. Nay, more - over and above this, God will give them the blessing of an \"everlasting covenant\" (comp. Isaiah 55:3).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah61:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd their seed shall be known among the Gentiles, and their offspring among the people: all that see them shall acknowledge them, that they are the seed which the LORD hath blessed.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 9. - Their seed shall be known; or, shall be illustrious (Lowth), renowned (Cheyne). A halo of renown still, in the eyes of many, attaches to Jewish descent. Among the people; rather, among the peoples. The seed which the Lord hath blessed; rather, a seed. The blessing has passed in the main to \"the Israel of God\" (Galatians 6:16).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah61:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTI will greatly rejoice in the LORD, my soul shall be joyful in my God; for he hath clothed me with the garments of salvation, he hath covered me with the robe of righteousness, as a bridegroom decketh himself with ornaments, and as a bride adorneth herself with her jewels.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 10, 11. - JERUSALEM ACCEPTS THE PROMISES, AND GLORIES IN JEHOVAH. So the Targum and Rosenmuller. Others think that \"the Servant\" is still speaking, or that Isaiah speaks in the name of the people. To us the exposition of the Targum appears the most satisfactory. It is in the manner of Isaiah suddenly to introduce a new speaker. Verse 10. - I will greatly rejoice in the Lord (comp. Habakkuk 3:18). The promises made were such as naturally to call forth on the part of Israel the most heartfelt joy and rejoicing - including, as they did, restoration, rule over the Gentiles, a universal priesthood, a wide territory, \"everlasting joy,\" a high renown, and an \"everlasting covenant. He hath clothed me with the garments of salvation (comp. Isaiah 59:17 and Isaiah 61:3). The metaphor occurs also in the Psalms (Psalm 71:6; Psalm 109:18). God clothes Israel with \"righteousness\" derived from himself (Isaiah 54:17, ad fin.), and then with its natural consequence - \"salvation.\" The result is to make Israel as a bridegroom who decketh himself with a priestly crown, and as a bride who adornoth herself with her jewels. That bridegrooms ordinarily wore crowns appears from the Mishna.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah61:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor as the earth bringeth forth her bud, and as the garden causeth the things that are sown in it to spring forth; so the Lord GOD will cause righteousness and praise to spring forth before all the nations.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 11. - As the garden; rather, as a garden. The Hebrew is without the article. Righteousness and praise. The essential result of righteousness is \"salvation\" (see ver. 20); its accidental result is \"praise\" or \"renown.\" Men cannot but recognize the benefits which flow to themselves from goodness in others; and a perfectly righteous nation would attract to itself universal praise (comp. Zephaniah 3:20, \"I will make you a name and a praise among all people of the earth, when I turn back your captivity before your eyes, saith the Lord \").NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINE","Isa.62":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah62:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor Zion's sake will I not hold my peace, and for Jerusalem's sake I will not rest, until the righteousness thereof go forth as brightness, and the salvation thereof as a lamp that burneth.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 1-12. - FURTHER GRACIOUS PROMISES MADE TO ISRAEL BY \"THE SERVANT.\" Some regard the speaker in this chapter as Jehovah; some as the prophet, or the prophetical order; some as \"the Servant.\" The last supposition appears to us the simplest and the best. The close connection with the preceding chapter is evident. If that then be, in the main, \"a soliloquy of the Servant,\" this should he a continuation of the soliloquy. Israel is promised \"righteousness,\" \"glory,\" \"a new name,\" a guard of angels, a time of peace and prosperity, deliverance from Babylon, and triumphant establishment in Zion under God's protection. Verse 1. - For Zion's sake will I not hold my peace. In the past God has kept silence (Isaiah 42:14; Isaiah 57:11). \"The Servant\" has not caused his voice to be heard. Babylon has been allowed to continue her oppression unchecked. But now there will be a change. God will lift up his voice, and the nations will hear; and the \"salvation\" of Israel will be effected speedily. For Jerusalem's sake. \"Zion\" and \"Jerusalem\" are used throughout as synonyms (Isaiah 2:3; Isaiah 4:3, 4; Isaiah 31:4, 5, and 9; 33:20; 40:9; 41:27; 52:1; 64:10, etc.), like \"Israel\" and Jacob.\" Strictly speaking, \"Zion\" is the mountain, \"Jerusalem\" the city built upon it. Until the righteousness thereof go forth (comp. Isaiah 54:17; Isaiah 61:10, 11). As brightness; or, as the dawn (comp Isaiah 60:3; Proverbs 4:18; Daniel 6:19). Salvation... as a lamp that burneth; rather, as a torch that blazeth (comp. Judges 15:4; Nahum 2:14; Zechariah 12:6). Israel's \"salvation\" would be made manifest; primarily by her triumphant return from Babylon, and more completely by her position in the final kingdom of the Redeemer.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah62:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the Gentiles shall see thy righteousness, and all kings thy glory: and thou shalt be called by a new name, which the mouth of the LORD shall name.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 2. - The Gentiles shall see, etc. A continuation of the account of Israel's final glory, as given in Isaiah 61:6-9. What the Gentiles are especially to see and admire is Israel's righteousness. This may point to those acknowledgments of the purity and excellence of the early Church which were made by the heathen (Plin., 'Epist.,' 10:97), and which culminated in the saying, \"See how these Christians love one another!\" The sceptic Gibbon acknowledges, among the causes of the success of Christianity, \"the virtues of the early Christians.\" All kings (comp. Isaiah 49:7, 23; Isaiah 60:3; Psalm 50:22:11). Thou shalt be called by a new name (comp. vers. 4 and 12; and see also Isaiah 65:15). It is not altogether clear what the \"new name\" is, since in the remainder of the present chapter more than one name is suggested. Rosenmuller supposes\" Hephzibah\" to be meant. Dr. Kay suggests \"the holy people,\" and notes that the title of \"holy ones,\" or \"saints,\" is given by St. Paul to all Christians (Acts 26:10; Romans 1:7; Romans 16:15; 1 Corinthians 1:2, etc.). Mr. Cheyne thinks that it is some unknown title of honour, akin to that mentioned by Jeremiah \"Jehovah our Righteousness\" (Jeremiah 33:16). \"New names\" will be given to individual saints in the heavenly kingdom (Revelation 2:17; Revelation 3:12).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah62:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThou shalt also be a crown of glory in the hand of the LORD, and a royal diadem in the hand of thy God.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 3. - Thou shalt also be a crown of glory, etc. God will exhibit Israel to an admiring world, as a man might exhibit a \"crown\" or \"diadem\" which he held in his hand. They will look on with admiration and reverence - \"for they shall perceive that it is his work\" (Psalm 64:9).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah62:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThou shalt no more be termed Forsaken; neither shall thy land any more be termed Desolate: but thou shalt be called Hephzibah, and thy land Beulah: for the LORD delighteth in thee, and thy land shall be married.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 4. - Thou shalt no more be termed Forsaken. Judah had believed herself\" forsaken\" of God (Isaiah 49:14), and had actually been, in a certain sense, forsaken \"for a small moment\" (Isaiah 54:7). Her enemies, it would seem, had gone so far as to give her the name in derision. Neither shall thy land ... be termed Desolate. Judaea had not only been desolated by the Babylonian invaders under Nebucbarlnezzar, but had remained \"desolate\" during the whole period of the Captivity (Isaiah 32:13, 14; Isaiah 49:19, etc.). It had come to be spoken of as Sh'marnah, \"a desolation\" (see Jeremiah 34:22; Jeremiah 44:2, 6; Ezekiel 33:29; Ezekiel 36:34). Now all should be altered. As Ezekiel prophesied, \"The land that was desolate is become like the garden of Eden; and the waste and desolate and ruined cities are become fenced and are inhabited\" (Ezekiel 36:35). Thou shalt be called Hephzi-bah; i.e. \"my delight is in her.\" Hephzi-bah was the name of Hezekiah's queen, Manasseh's mother (2 Kings 21:1). And thy land Beulah. Beulah, or rather Be'ulah, means \"married\" (comp. Isaiah 54:1). Judaea would be \"married\" to her sons, or her people, when they quitted Babylon and once more took possession of her. The Hebrew verb toe \"to marry\" (as a man marries) means literally \"to be lord over.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah62:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor as a young man marrieth a virgin, so shall thy sons marry thee: and as the bridegroom rejoiceth over the bride, so shall thy God rejoice over thee.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 5. - As the bridegroom rejoiceth over the bride. There is a double employment of the analogy with marriage here. The land, Judaea, personified as a female, is married to her sons, or her people, regarded (in this connection) as a male. The people, regarded as a female (\"the virgin daughter of Zion,\" Isaiah 37:22) is also married to Jehovah, and recognizes him as her Bridegroom (Comp. Isaiah 54:5). As Bridegroom, God calls his bride \"Hephzi-bah\" - \"my delight is in her.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah62:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTI have set watchmen upon thy walls, O Jerusalem, which shall never hold their peace day nor night: ye that make mention of the LORD, keep not silence,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 6. - I have set watchmen upon thy walls. \"The Servant\" has appointed watchers upon the walls of Zion - either \"prophets\" (Delitzsch), or \"priests and prophets\" (Kay), or, more probably, \"angelic beings\" (Cheyne), who keep perpetual watch and ward (Comp. Isaiah 52:8). Neither day nor night do they hold their peace, or keep silence, but ever intercede with God for his people, like the \"angel of Jehovah\" in Zechariah 1:12, reminding him of his covenant with them, and his promises to them, and exhorting him to \"awake, awake\" for his own honour's sake (Isaiah 51:9-11). It is generally allowed that the \"watchers\" in Daniel 4:13, 17, 23 are angels; and the same interpretation best suits the \"watchmen\" of the present passage. Ye that make mention of the Lord; rather, as in the margin, ye that are the Lord's remembrancers; i.e. \"ye whose business it is to call to God's remembrance the needs and claims of his people, and the obligations of his covenant promises.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah62:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd give him no rest, till he establish, and till he make Jerusalem a praise in the earth.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 7. - Give him no rest. Compare the teaching of our Lord with respect to the efficacy of importunity (Luke 11:5-8; Luke 18:1-8).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah62:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe LORD hath sworn by his right hand, and by the arm of his strength, Surely I will no more give thy corn to be meat for thine enemies; and the sons of the stranger shall not drink thy wine, for the which thou hast laboured:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 8. - The Lord hath sworn. In answer to the representations of the \"remembrancers,\" God solemnly binds himself by an oath to come to the relief of the people, to restore them to their own land, and to give them the enjoyment of its fruits in peace. By his right hand. God commonly swears \"by himself\" (Genesis 22:16; Isaiah 45:23; Jeremiah 49:13; Jeremiah 51:14; Amos 6:5), or \"by his holiness\" (Psalm 89:35; Amos 4:2). Once he swears \"by his great Name\" (Jeremiah 44:26), and once \"by the excellency of Jacob\" (Amos 8:7). There is no other place in Scripture where he swears \"by his right hand and arm\" - emblems of his power to act. Thy corn... thy wine; i.e. the fruits of thy land. Hitherto, even when Israel was in possession of Palestine, its fruits were constantly destroyed, or carried off, by the raids of hostile neighbours. Henceforth this plundering should cease.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah62:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut they that have gathered it shall eat it, and praise the LORD; and they that have brought it together shall drink it in the courts of my holiness.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 9. - Shall drink it in the courts of my holiness. This is not to be understood literally, at any rate, of the whole produce of the laud. What is meant is, that the produce will be consecrated by such festal means as the Law enjoined (Deuteronomy 14:22-27), and that then the remainder will be consumed with due thanks and acknowledgments.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah62:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTGo through, go through the gates; prepare ye the way of the people; cast up, cast up the highway; gather out the stones; lift up a standard for the people.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 10. - Go through, go through the gates. The speaker returns to the period of the exile, and exhorts the people to pass forth from Babylon, and speed on their way homewards (comp. Isaiah 48:20; Isaiah 52:11). Some of them are to clear away obstacles, others are to bring materials and construct a highway along which the stream of emigrants may march (comp. Isaiah 57:14), while a third body removes such stones as might cause stumbling, and a fourth lifts up a standard to direct the march.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah62:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBehold, the LORD hath proclaimed unto the end of the world, Say ye to the daughter of Zion, Behold, thy salvation cometh; behold, his reward is with him, and his work before him.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 11. - Meanwhile Jehovah, by his angels or his prophets, causes it to be made known to the ends of the earth that the redemption of Israel draws nigh, and that Zion's\" salvation\" approaches. His reward is with him, etc. The words are repeated from Isaiah 40:10. Here they are certainly said of Israel. They go forth from Babylon, having their reward with them - i.e. liberty, honour, riches to some extent (Ezra 1:4-11), and their work, or rather their recompense - the possession of Palestine - before them.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah62:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd they shall call them, The holy people, The redeemed of the LORD: and thou shalt be called, Sought out, A city not forsaken.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 12. - They shall call them; or, men shall call them, equivalent to \"they shall be called.\" The holy people. The Persians in some degree recognized this character in the Israelites (Ezra 1:2, 3; Ezra 6:8-12: 7:12-26). So did Alexander, according to Josephus. The Romans, on the contrary, regarded them as the votaries of a degrading superstition. Since the Roman conquest, they have been almost universally despised. Perhaps the prophecy may be considered to still await its complete fulfilment. Thou shalt be called. \"Thou\" refers to Zion or Jerusalem. She should be called Sought out - i.e. a special object of God's care - and A city not for-saken - the very opposite of her former name (ver. 4), which was \"Forsaken.\" All the conditions of her former existence would be altered, nay, reversed, in the future.NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINE","Isa.63":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah63:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWho is this that cometh from Edom, with dyed garments from Bozrah? this that is glorious in his apparel, travelling in the greatness of his strength? I that speak in righteousness, mighty to save.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 1-6. - A JUDGMENT ON IDUMAEA. Isaiah had already, in the first portion of his prophecy, announced\" a great slaughter in the land of Idumaea\" as resolved on in the counsels of God (Isaiah 34:5-10). He now recurs to the subject, and represents Jehovah as a warrior with blood-stained garments, fresh from the field of battle in Edom, where he has trodden down his foes and taken a fierce vengeance on them. The Idumaeans probably represent the world-power; and the \"day of vengeance\" may be one still future, in which the enemies of God will feel the weight of his hand. The description stands by itself, neither connected with what goes before nor with what follows. It has the appearance of a separate poem, which accident has placed in its present position. In form it is \"a lyrico-dramatic dialogue between the prophet as a bystander and a victorious warrior (i.e. Jehovah) returning from battle in Idumaea\" (Cheyne). Verse 1. - Who is this? The prophet opens the dialogue with an inquiry, \"Who is it that presents himself before him suddenly in a strange guise?\" He comes from Edom, from Bozrah - a principal Edomite city (see the comment on Isaiah 34:6) - with dyed garments; or, rather, with blood-red garments-garments incarnadined with gore. \"Who is this,\" again he asks, \"that is glorious (or, splendid) in his apparel\" - the blood-stained vesture of the conqueror was a glory to him (Nahum 2:3; Revelation 19:13)- \"as he travels\" (or, \"bends forward\" ) in the greatness of his strength - exhibiting in his movements a mighty indomitable strength? Who is it? The reply is immediate - I that speak in righteousness, mighty to save; i.e. I, whose every word is \"holy, just, and true,\" who alone am able to \"save to the uttermost all that come to me\" (Hebrews 7:25). The answer unmistakably indicates that the figure which has appeared to the prophet is that of Jehovah.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah63:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWherefore art thou red in thine apparel, and thy garments like him that treadeth in the winefat?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 2. - Wherefore art thou red in thine apparel? The prophet resumes his questioning. What means the redness of thine apparel? Whence the stains? Are they wine-stains consequent on treading the winepress? Among the Hebrews, as among the Egyptians (Wilkinson, 'Ancient Egyptians,' vol. 1. p. 46), the juice of the grape was trodden out by the feet of men, who often splashed some upon their garments (Genesis 49:11).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah63:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTI have trodden the winepress alone; and of the people there was none with me: for I will tread them in mine anger, and trample them in my fury; and their blood shall be sprinkled upon my garments, and I will stain all my raiment.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 3. - I have trodden the wine-press. The warrior replies. He accepts the suggestion of the prophet; but metaphorically, not literally. He has indeed been \"treading a wine-press,\" but it is the wine-press of his fury, in which he has trampled down his enemies; and the stains upon his raiment are, consequently, not wine-stains, but stains of blood (comp. Joel 3:13; Lamentations 1:15; Revelation 14:19, 20; Revelation 19:15). Alone. In mine own might, with none to aid me. The literal wine-press was always trodden by a band of men. Of the people; rather, of the peoples; i.e. of the neighbouring nations none took part with God against the special enemies of his people, the Idumaeans. All more or less sympathized with his adversaries, and therefore participated in their punishment (see ver. 6). For I will tread them... trample them; rather, so I trode them ... trampled them (Lowth, Rosenmuller, Delitzsch, Cheyne, by an alteration of the vowel-points). The whole is a prophecy of the future; but the dramatic form of the narrative requires that the verbs should be in the past. As \"the peoples\" would not help God, but took the side of his enemies, they too were placed in the winepress, and crushed under his feet. Their blood; literally, their juice. Lowth and Kay translate, \"life-blood;\" Delitzsch, \"life-sap;\" Mr. Cheyne, excellently, \"life-stream.\" Shall be sprinkled... will stain; rather, was sprinkled... stained.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah63:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor the day of vengeance is in mine heart, and the year of my redeemed is come.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 4. - For the day of vengeance is in my heart. Translate, for a day of vengeance was in my heart (comp Isaiah 34:8; Isaiah 61:2). \"A day\" is time enough for God to take vengeance, to kill, and to destroy. He hastens over work that is necessary, but uncongenial. But he lengthens out the time of release and redemption for his loved ones. The \"day of vengeance\" ushers in the \"year of redemption.\" Is come; rather, was come. The Divine speaker goes back to the time preceding the actual punishment of the nations.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah63:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd I looked, and there was none to help; and I wondered that there was none to uphold: therefore mine own arm brought salvation unto me; and my fury, it upheld me.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 5. - And I looked, and there was none to help (comp. Isaiah 5:2, \"He looked that it should bring forth grapes, and it brought forth wild grapes:\" also Isaiah 41:28, \"I beheld, and there was no man\"). By an anthropomorphism God is represented as looking for and expecting what might reasonably have been expected, and even as surprised when he does not find it (comp. Isaiah 59:16). Out of all the many nations it was reasonable to suppose that some would have chosen the better part and have been on the Lord's side. But the fact was otherwise (comp. ver. 3). Mine own arm brought salvation unto me; or, mine own arm helped me (comp. Isaiah 59:16). Nothing more is needed. If God arises, his enemies at once \"are scattered\" (Psalm 68:1). \"His own right hand, and his holy arm, get him the victory\" (Psalm 98:1).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah63:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd I will tread down the people in mine anger, and make them drunk in my fury, and I will bring down their strength to the earth.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 6. - I will tread down... make drunk ... bring down; rather, I trode down... made drunk... brought down. See the comment on ver. 3. The destruction was to be utter, overwhelming, absolute - one from which there could be no recovery (comp. Revelation 19:11-21, where the simile of the wine-press, and the \"vesture dipped in blood,\" seem introduced with a special reference to this passage). SECTION X. ? AN ADDRESS OF THE EXILES TO GOD, INCLUDING THANKSGIVING, CONFESSION OF SIN, AND SUPPLICATION (CH. 63:7-64.).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah63:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTI will mention the lovingkindnesses of the LORD, and the praises of the LORD, according to all that the LORD hath bestowed on us, and the great goodness toward the house of Israel, which he hath bestowed on them according to his mercies, and according to the multitude of his lovingkindnesses.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 7-14. - GOD PRAISED FOR HIS MERCIES. The address opens with pure and simple thanksgiving of the most general kind, God being praised for his loving-kindness, compassion, and sympathy with his people (vers. 7-9). An historical survey is then commenced, and Israel's shortcomings contrasted with God's mercies, but with a predominantly thankful and even jubilant tone (vers. 10-14). Verse 7. - I will mention; or, celebrate. The loving-kindnesses; or, mercies (see Isaiah 55:3; and comp. Psalm 89:1).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah63:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor he said, Surely they are my people, children that will not lie: so he was their Saviour.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 8. - He said, Surely they are my people. Israel was first recognized as \"a people\" in Egypt, when the creel Pharaoh, probably Sethos I., said, \"The people of the children of Israel are more and mightier than we \"(Exodus 1:9). Soon afterwards God acknowledged them as \"his people\" (Exodus 3:7). The exiles probably go back in their thoughts to this time. Children that will not lie; or, deal falsely, as the same word is translated in Psalm 44:17. The meaning is, that surely they will be faithful to God, and not fall away from him into idolatry or irreligion.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah63:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTIn all their affliction he was afflicted, and the angel of his presence saved them: in his love and in his pity he redeemed them; and he bare them, and carried them all the days of old.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 9. - In all their affliction he was afflicted. The \"affliction\" of Israel began in Egypt (Genesis 15:13), probably not long after the death of Joseph. It became an intense oppression, when the king \"arose who knew not Joseph\" (Exodus 1:8). God's sympathy with Israel's sufferings at this time is strongly marked in the narrative of Exodus (Exodus 2:23, 24; Exodus 3:7, 17). An alternative reading of the Hebrew text gives the sense, \"In all their affliction he was not an adversary;\" i.e. he did not afflict them for their hurt, but for their benefit. But the reading followed by our translators, and most moderns, is to be preferred. The angel of his presence saved them. \"The angel of his presence\" occurs nowhere but in this place. It is probably equivalent to \"the angel of God\" (Exodus 14:19; Judges 15:6; Acts 27:23), or \"the angel of the Lord\" (Genesis 16:7; Numbers 22:23; Judges 13:3, etc.), and designates either the Second Person of the Trinity, or the highest of the angelic company, who seems to be the archangel Michael (see Pussy's 'Daniel,' pp. 525, 526). (For the angelic interpositions which \"saved\" Israel, see Exodus 14:19; Judges 6:11-23; Judges 13:3-21; 2 Kings 19:35, etc.) In his love and in his pity he redeemed them. The \"redemption\" of this passage is probably that from the bondage of Egypt (Exodus 6:6; Exodus 15:13; Deuteronomy 7:8, etc.), which belonged to \"the days of old\" - not the spiritual redemption from the bondage of sin, which was reserved for the time of the Messiah. Having \"redeemed\" them, i.e. delivered them out of the hand of the Egyptians, and thereby, as it were, purchased them to be his own, he bare them - \"Carried them on eagles' wings\" (Exodus 19:4), and brought them safely through the wilderness to Palestine (comp. Deuteronomy 32:10-12).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah63:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut they rebelled, and vexed his holy Spirit: therefore he was turned to be their enemy, and he fought against them.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 10. - But they rebelled. The rebellions of Israel against God commenced in the wilderness. They rebelled at Sinai, when they set up the golden calf; at Meribah (Numbers 20:24); at Shittim, when they consorted with the daughters of Moab (Numbers 25:6). Under the Judges, their conduct was one long rebellion (Judges 2:11; Judges 3:7, 12; Judges 4:1; Judges 6:1; Judges 8:33; Judges 10:6; Judges 13:1). They rebelled in Samuel's time by asking for a king (1 Samuel 8:5, 19, 20). The ten tribes rebelled under Jeroboam, and set up the idolatry of the calves at Dan and Bethel. Worse idolatries followed, and in two centuries and a half had reached such a height, that God was provoked to \"remove Israel out of his sight\" (2 Kings 17:23). Judah remained, but \"rebelled\" under Manasseh, Jehoiakim, Jehoiachin, and Zedekiah, \"transgressing very much after all the abominations of the heathen, and polluting the very house of the Lord at Jerusalem\" (2 Chronicles 36:14). These rebellions against God vexed his Holy Spirit - \"provoked him,\" \"grieved him,\" \"moved the Holy One in Israel\" (Psalm 78:40, 41; Psalm 106:43). Therefore he was turned to be their enemy (comp. Jeremiah 30:14; Lamentations 2:4, 5). Judah had \"filled up the measure of her iniquities,\" had gone on \"until there was no remedy\" (2 Chronicles 36:16). God's indignation was therefore poured out upon her without let or stint. \"He cut oft' in his fierce anger all the horn of Israel: he drew back his right hand from before the enemy; he burned against Jacob like a flaming fire, which devoureth round about. He bent his bow like an enemy; he stood with his right hand as an adversary, and slew all that were pleasant in the tabernacle of the daughter of Zion; he poured out his fury like fire. The Lord was as an enemy\" (Lamentations 2:3-5). He fought against them; rather, he himself fought against them. God himself, though they were \"his people,\" yet fought against them and for the Chaldeans in that final struggle. He \"gave the city into the hand of the King of Babylon\" (Jeremiah 34:2).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah63:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen he remembered the days of old, Moses, and his people, saying, Where is he that brought them up out of the sea with the shepherd of his flock? where is he that put his holy Spirit within him?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 11. - Then he remembered the days of old. It is questioned who remembered, God or his people. Gesenius, Hitzig, Ewald, Nagelbach, Delitzsch, Knobel, and Mr. Cheyne are in favour of the people; Bishop Lowth and Dr. Kay of God. The reflections which follow (vers. 11-13) seem certainly most appropriate to the people, or to the prophet speaking in their name. Where is he that brought them up out of the sea? i.e. \"the Red Sea\" (comp. Isaiah 51:10). What has become of the protecting God who then delivered them? With the shepherd of his flock; or, shepherds, according to another reading. The \"shepherd\" might be either Moses, or \"the angel of his face\" (ver. 9). The \"shepherds\" - if that reading be preferred - must be Moses, Aaron, and perhaps Miriam (Micah 6:4). Where he that put his Holy Spirit within him? The \"him\" of this passage undoubtedly refers to \"the people\" (Rosenmuller, Knobel, Delitzsch, Kay, Cheyne). God gave to the people in the wilderness \"his good Spirit to instruct them\" (Nehemiah 9:20), and guide them (Haggai 2:4, 5), and govern them (Numbers 11:17).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah63:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThat led them by the right hand of Moses with his glorious arm, dividing the water before them, to make himself an everlasting name?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 12. - That led them by the right hand of Moses with his glorious arm; rather, that caused his glorious arm to attend at Moses right hand - ready (as Dr. Weir says) to grasp him if he should stumble. Dividing the water before them; literally, cleaving the waters before their face (comp. Exodus 14:21). To make himself an everlasting name (see Exodus 15:11-16). It was one of the main purposes of the entire series of miracles wrought in Egypt, \"that God's Name might be declared throughout all the earth\" (Exodus 9:16).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah63:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThat led them through the deep, as an horse in the wilderness, that they should not stumble?VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah63:14VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAs a beast goeth down into the valley, the Spirit of the LORD caused him to rest: so didst thou lead thy people, to make thyself a glorious name.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 14. - As a beast goeth down into the valley. Bishop Lowth's version seems the best,\" As the herd descendeth to the valley.\" Israel's passage through the Sinaitic peninsula into Canaan is compared to the movement of a herd of cattle from its summer pastures in the mountains to the valley at their base, where for a time it rests. So God gave his people, after their many trials, \"rest\" in Canaan (Hebrews 3:11-18). So didst thou lead thy people. \"So\" refers, not to the last simile only, but to the entire description contained in vers. 11-14. To make thyself a glorious name (comp. ver. 12, and see also Ezekiel 36:21-23; Malachi 1:2).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah63:15VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTLook down from heaven, and behold from the habitation of thy holiness and of thy glory: where is thy zeal and thy strength, the sounding of thy bowels and of thy mercies toward me? are they restrained?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 15-19. - A PRAYER FOR DELIVERANCE FROM SIN AND SUFFERING. From thanksgiving and confession, the people betake themselves to prayer, and beseech God to look down from heaven once more, to have compassion on them, to acknowledge them, and to save them alike from themselves (ver. 17) and from their adversaries (vers. 18, 19). \"It is difficult to overrate the spiritual beauty of the prayer contained in this passage. We may admit that the most prominent motive urged by the speaker has a nationalistic air; but behind this, and strengthening it, is a sense of the infiniteness of the Divine mercy, and of the strong vitality of the union between Jehovah and his people\" (Cheyne). Verse 15. - Look down from heaven (comp. Deuteronomy 26:15; Psalm 80:14; 2 Kings 8:30). \"The Lord's seat\" was \"in heaven.\" While the temple lay in ruins, the Jews would naturally address their prayers to God in his heavenly abode. From the habitation of thy holiness. Mr. Cheyne translates, from the height of thy holiness,\" taking the meaning of the rare word z'bul from the Assyrian. \"Height\" certainly suits well most of the other places where the word z'bul occurs (1 Kings 8:13; 2 Chronicles 6:2; Psalm 49:14; Habakkuk 3:11). Where is thy zeal? i.e. What has become of it? Has it ceased altogether, or is it only in abeyance for a time? Will not God \"stir it up\" once more (Isaiah 42:13)? And thy strength; rather, and thy great acts (comp. Psalm 106:2; Psalm 145:4; Psalm 150:2). The sounding of thy bowels; i.e. their thrilling or vibration - an indication of sympathy (see Isaiah 16:11). Jeremiah has a similar expression (Jeremiah 31:20). Are they restrained? rather, they are restrained. They no longer show themselves. There was no room for questioning the fact.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah63:16VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTDoubtless thou art our father, though Abraham be ignorant of us, and Israel acknowledge us not: thou, O LORD, art our father, our redeemer; thy name is from everlasting.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 16. - Doubtless thou art our Father; rather, for thou art our Father. This is the ground of their appeal to God. As their Father, he must love them, and must be ready to listen to them. Abraham and Isaac, their earthly fathers, were of no service, lent them no aid, seemed to have ceased to feel any interest in them. It cannot be justly argued from this that the Jews looked to Abraham and Isaac as actual \"patron saints,\" or directed towards them their religious regards. Had this been so, there would have been abundant evidence of it. Thou, O Lord, art our Father (comp. Isaiah 64:8; and see also Deuteronomy 32:6, and Jeremiah 3:4). Though the relationship was revealed under the old covenant, it was practically realized only upon the rarest occasions. Our Redeemer; thy name, etc.; rather, our Redeemer has been thy name from of old. \"Redeemer\" first appears as a name of God in Job (Job 19:25) and in the Psalms (Psalm 19:14; Psalm 78:35). It is an epitheton usitatum only in the later portion of Isaiah. There it occurs thirteen times.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah63:17VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTO LORD, why hast thou made us to err from thy ways, and hardened our heart from thy fear? Return for thy servants' sake, the tribes of thine inheritance.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 17. - Why hast thou made us to err from thy ways? Confession is here mingled with a kind of reproach. They have erred and strayed from God's ways, they ' allow; but why has he permitted it? Why has he, the shepherd of his flock (Isaiah 40:11; Isaiah 49:10), not restrained his wandering sheep, and kept them in his \"ways \"or \"paths\" ? The reproach borders on irreverence, but is kept within the limits of piety by the affection and trust that underlie it. They are like wayward children reproaching a tender mother, not quite believing in the justice of their reproaches, but with a very confident faith in her love and in her power to aid. They entertain no doubt but that God will \"return\" to them, and acknowledge them as his sheep, and resume their guidance and direction. And hardened our heart (comp. Exodus 4:21; Exodus 7:3; Exodus 9:12; Exodus 10:1), \"When men have scornfully and obstinately rejected the grace of God, God withdraws it from them judicially, gives them up to their wanderings, and makes their hearts incapable of faith\" (Delitzsch). If the process has not gone very far, God may relent, and \"return,\" and soften the proud heart, and renew in it \"his fear.\" This is what Israel now entreats him to do. For thy servants'sake. There was always \"a remnant\" in the worst times, which had not\" bowed the knee to Baal.\" This was God's true \"inheritance,\" which he might be expected to protect and aid.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah63:18VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe people of thy holiness have possessed it but a little while: our adversaries have trodden down thy sanctuary.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 18. - The people of thy holiness; or, thy holy people (comp. Isaiah 62:9; Isaiah 63:15: 64:11). Some critics read har, \"mountain,\" instead of ' am, \"people,\" and translate, \"But for a little while have they\" (i.e. thy servants) \"had possession of thy holy mountain.\" The general meaning is the same in either case. \"Israel, God's people, has held Palestine but for a little while\" - a few centuries - and now the heathen have been allowed to make themselves masters of it, (comp. Ezra 10:8).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah63:19VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWe are thine: thou never barest rule over them; they were not called by thy name.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 19. - We are thine. There is no \"thine\" in the original, and so important a word cannot possibly be supplied from without. Translate, We are as those over whom thou hast not ruled from of old, as those upon whom thy Name has not been called; i.e. we have lost all our privileges - we have become in God's sight no better than the heathen - he has forgotten that we were ever his people.NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINE","Isa.64":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah64:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTOh that thou wouldest rend the heavens, that thou wouldest come down, that the mountains might flow down at thy presence,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 1-12. - ISRAEL'S PRAYER CONTINUED AND CONCLUDED. Not content with praying God to look upon them once more with favour (Isaiah 63:15), Israel now asks for a theophany, or manifestation of the Divine Presence, such as they have experienced in the times of old, and such as shall suffice to strike terror into the hearts of their enemies (vers. 1-4). With profound humility confessing their manifold and grievous iniquities, they beseech God once more, as their Father and Maker, to have pity upon them, reminding him of the desolate condition of Judaea and Jerusalem, and urging him no longer to \"refrain himself\" (vers. 5-12). \"The manner,\" as Mr. Cheyne observes, \"is that of a liturgical psalm; the prophet, as it were, leads the devotions of the assembled Church,\" and utters in impassioned language the feelings which deeply move them. Verse 1. - Oh that thou wouldest rend the heavens! God \"dwells in the thick darkness\" (2 Chronicles 6:1). \"Thick clouds are a covering to him\" as he \"walketh in the circuit of heaven\" (Job 22:14). The Church would have the covering \"rent,\" and God show himself openly, both to his people and to their enemies. That thou wouldest come down! God\" came down\" ou Sinai in the sight of all the people (Exodus 19:11, 20). David saw him in vision \"bow the heavens and come down; and there was darkness under his feet\" (Psalm 18:9). It is such an \"epiphany\" which the Church now desires - a revelation of God in all his glory, in his might as against \"the nations\" (ver. 2), in his mercifulness as towards themselves. That the mountains might flow down; or, quake. When God descended on Sinai, \"the whole mount quaked greatly\" (Exodus 19:18). When he appeared to David, \"the earth shook and trembled; the foundations also of the hills moved and were shaken\" (Psalm 18:7). When he was seen of Elijah, \"a great and strong wind rent the mountains, and brake in pieces the rocks before the Lord; and after the wind was an earthquake\" (1 Kings 19:11). Micah saw the Lord \"coming forth out of his place,\" and \"the mountains were molten under him, and the valleys cleft\" (Micah 1:3, 4). The mountains represent that which is most firm and solid and strong upon the face of the earth. If even they \"melt and flow and tremble\" at the presence of God, what might must his be! And who may abide him?NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah64:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAs when the melting fire burneth, the fire causeth the waters to boil, to make thy name known to thine adversaries, that the nations may tremble at thy presence!VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 2. - As when the melting fire burneth, etc.; rather, as when fire kindles brushwood, and makes water to boil. Connect the similes with the last clause of ver. 1. The mountains shall be as powerless to resist Jehovah, as brushwood or water to resist fire. To make thy Name known (comp. Isaiah 63:12). Such an \"epiphany\" as the Church prays for would make the Name of Jehovah known far and wide, exalting him high above all gods, and causing \"the nations\" - i.e. the whole heathen world - to \"tremble at his presence\" and refrain from injuring his people.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah64:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWhen thou didst terrible things which we looked not for, thou camest down, the mountains flowed down at thy presence.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 3 - When thou didst terrible things (comp. Deuteronomy 10:21; 2 Samuel 7:23; Psalm 49:4; Psalm 106:22). The phrase, as Mr. Cheyne remarks, is a \"standing\" one for the wonders of the Exodus. Which we looked not for; i.e. which transcended our utmost expectations. Thou earnest down (see Exodus 19:11, 20).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah64:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor since the beginning of the world men have not heard, nor perceived by the ear, neither hath the eye seen, O God, beside thee, what he hath prepared for him that waiteth for him.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 4. - Neither hath the eye seen, O God, beside thee, what he hath prepared, etc.; rather, as in the margin, neither hath the eye seen a God, beside thee, which worketh for him that waiteth upon him. The only \"living God\" who really works for his votaries, and does them good service, is Jehovah (comp. Isaiah 41:23, 24; Isaiah 44:9, etc.).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah64:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThou meetest him that rejoiceth and worketh righteousness, those that remember thee in thy ways: behold, thou art wroth; for we have sinned: in those is continuance, and we shall be saved.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 5. - Thou meetest him that rejoiceth. God \"meets\" with gracious welcome and ready aid whoever rejoices in doing righteousness and serving him, whoever \"remembers him in his ways.\" But this, alas: is not the present relationship between God and Israel. God is \"angry\" with them - they must, therefore, \"have sinned;\" and so they proceed to confess their sin. In those is continuance, and we shall be saved. This is a very difficult passage. Mr. Cheyne regards it as hopelessly corrupt. Bishop Lowth and Ewald attempt emendations. Of those who accept the present text, some understand \"in those\" of God's ways, others of the \"sins\" implied in the confession, \"We have sinned:\" some make the last clause an affirmation, others a question. Delitzsch renders, \"Already we have been long in this state (of sin), and shall we be saved?\" Grotius and Starck, \"If we had remained in them (i.e. thy ways) continually, we should have been saved.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah64:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut we are all as an unclean thing, and all our righteousnesses are as filthy rags; and we all do fade as a leaf; and our iniquities, like the wind, have taken us away.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 6. - But we are all as an unclean thing; rather, we are all become as one who is unclean (comp. Isaiah 35:8; Isaiah 52:1). A moral leprosy is upon us. We are like the leprous man, who has to rend his clothes, and to go about crying \"Tame! tame!\" \"Unclean: unclean!\" that those who hear may get out of his way. All our righteousnesses are as filthy rags; or, as a menstruous garment (see Lamentations 1:17). In the best deeds of the best men there is some taint of evil. As Hooker says, \"Our very repentances require to be repented of.\" We all do fade as a leaf (comp. Isaiah 1:30, \"Ye shall be as an oak whose leaf fadeth;\" see also Isaiah 34:4). Our iniquities... have taken as away; or, carried us away; i.e. taken us far from God, carried us into a region where God is not, or where at any rate \"his presence is not felt\" (Cheyne).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah64:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd there is none that calleth upon thy name, that stirreth up himself to take hold of thee: for thou hast hid thy face from us, and hast consumed us, because of our iniquities.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 7. - There is none that calleth on thy Name. A hyperbole, like Psalm 19:1, 3, \"There is none that doeth good, no, not one.\" A general lethargy and apathy had come over the people, so that they could with difficulty rouse themselves to faith and calling upon God. But this general lethargy was not universal; there was a \"remnant\" which \"prayed and did not faint.\" That stirreth up himself to take hold of thee. This expresses more than mere prayer; it is earnest, intense, \"effectual fervent\" prayer. Perhaps none among the exiles may have been capable of such supplication as this, especially as God had hid his face from them, and no longer looked on them with favour. And hast consumed us, because of our iniquities; rather, and hast delivered us into the power (literally, hand) of our iniquities. Men's sins are their masters, and exercise a tyrannical control over them, which they are often quite unable to resist (comp. Ezekiel 33:10, \"If our transgressions and our sins be upon us, and we pine away in them, how should we then live?\"). God at times judicially delivers the wicked into the power of their sins (see Romans 1:24, 26, 28).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah64:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut now, O LORD, thou art our father; we are the clay, and thou our potter; and we all are the work of thy hand.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 8. - But now, O Lord, thou art our Father (see the comment on Isaiah 63:16). We are the clay, and thou our Potter (comp. Isaiah 29:16; Isaiah 45:9). Thy hands have made us and fashioned us, both as individuals and as a nation. Thou hast lavished thy labour and thy skill upon us. Surely thou wilt not \"forsake the work of thine own hands\" (Psalm 138:8).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah64:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBe not wroth very sore, O LORD, neither remember iniquity for ever: behold, see, we beseech thee, we are all thy people.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 9. - Be not wroth very sore. At the time of the Captivity God was wroth very sore (Lamentations 5:22). His auger was hot against the sheep of his pasture (Psalm 74:1). But they had suffered, they had been afflicted many years. Might he not now relent, and remit somewhat from his fierce anger? Neither remember iniquity (comp. Psalm 79:8). God had already made a promise by the mouth of Isaiah, \"I, even I, am he that blotteth out thy trangressions, and will not remember thy sins\" (Isaiah 43:25). The captives lay hold, as it were, on this promise, and entreat that their \"iniquity\" may be not only forgiven, but forgotten (Jeremiah 31:34). We are all thy people. A fresh argument. \"We are thy children,\" individually (ver. 8); \"we are thy work, thy creatures\" (ver. 8), again individually; but also, \"we are all of us (kullanu), collectively, thy people\" - the people whom thou hast chosen to thyself, and over whom thou hast watched for so many centuries. Surely this consideration, if no other, will induce thee to forego thy wrath and forgive our iniquity.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah64:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThy holy cities are a wilderness, Zion is a wilderness, Jerusalem a desolation.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 10. - Thy holy cities are a wilderness. Commonly Jerusalem stands alone as \"the holy city\" (Isaiah 48:2; Isaiah 56:1; Daniel 9:24; Nehemiah 11:1, 18); but here the epithet is applied to the cities of Judah generally. They were all in a certain sense \"holy,\" as being comprised within the limits of \"the holy land\" (Zechariah 2:12) and \"the holy border\" (Psalm 78:54). Zion... Jerusalem (see the comment on Isaiah 62:1).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah64:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTOur holy and our beautiful house, where our fathers praised thee, is burned up with fire: and all our pleasant things are laid waste.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 11. - Our holy and our beautiful house. This is the true meaning. The exiles have the tenderest and most vivid remembrance of the holiness and the beauty (or glory) of that edifice, which had formed the centre of the national life for above four centuries, and had been a marvel of richness and magnificence. Many of them had seen it with their own eyes (Ezra 3:12), and could never forget its splendours. Where our fathers praised thee. Though in the later times of the Captivity there were still some of the exiles who had seen the temple, and probably worshipped in it, yet with the great majority it was otherwise. They thought of the temple as the place where their \"fathers\" had worshipped. Burned up with fire (see 2 Kings 25:9; 2 Chronicles 36:19; Jeremiah 52:13). Our pleasant things; or, our delectable things - as in Isaiah 44:9; the courts, gardens, outbuildings of the temple, are probably meant.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah64:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWilt thou refrain thyself for these things, O LORD? wilt thou hold thy peace, and afflict us very sore?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 12. - Wilt thou refrain thyself for these things? rather, at these things - seeing that these things are so.

God's mercy is such that it even overflows upon those who are outside the covenant (ver. 1). It has been offered to Israel, but Israel has rejected it. Their rebellion, their idolatries, and their pride have caused, and must continue to cause, their punishment (vers. 2-7). Verse 1. - I am sought; rather, inquired of, or consulted (comp. Ezekiel 14:3; Ezekiel 20:3, 31). The application of the text by St. Paul (Romans 10:20) to the calling of the Gentiles will be felt by all believers in inspiration to preclude the interpretation which supposes Israel to be the subject of ver. 1 no less than of vers. 2-7. I said, Behold me. This was the first step in the conversion of the Gentiles. God called them by his messengers, the apostles and evangelists. A nation that was not called by thy Name (so Gesenius, Delitzsch, Kay, and others). Bishop Lowth, Ewald, Diestel, and Mr. Cheyne, following the Septuagint and other ancient versions, render, \"a nation that has not called upon thy Name.\" But this requires an alteration of the vowel-points, which seems unnecessary.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah65:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTI have spread out my hands all the day unto a rebellious people, which walketh in a way that was not good, after their own thoughts;VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 2. - I have spread out my hands. Not exactly in prayer, but in expostulation (comp. Proverbs 1:24, \"I have stretched out my hand,\" where the verb in the Hebrew is the same). All the day; or, all day long, as in Romans 10:21; i.e. continually, day after day, for years - nay, for centuries. A rebellions people (comp. Isaiah 30:1; and see also Isaiah 1:4, 23; Hosea 4:16; Jeremiah 5:23; Jeremiah 6:28). The \"rebellions people\" ('am sorer)is undoubtedly Israel. In a way that was not good; rather, in the way that is not good; i.e. the \"way of sinners\" (Psalm 1:1) - the \"way that leadeth to destruction\" (Matthew 7:13).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah65:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTA people that provoketh me to anger continually to my face; that sacrificeth in gardens, and burneth incense upon altars of brick;VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 3. - That sacrificeth in gardens (comp. Isaiah 1:29; Isaiah 57:5; Isaiah 66:17). The groves and \"gardens\" of Daphne, near Antioch. became famous in later times as the scene of idolatrous practices intimately bound up with the grossest and most shameless sensualism. We have few details of the ancient Syrian rites; but there is reason to believe that, wherever Astarte, the Dea Syra, was worshipped, whether at Daphne, or at Hierapolis, or at Balbek, or at Aphek, or at Damascus, or in Palestine, one and the same character of cult prevailed. The nature-goddess was viewed as best worshipped by rites into which sensualism entered as an essential element. Profligacy that cannot be described polluted the consecrated precincts, which were rendered attractive by all that was beautiful and delightful, whether in art or nature-by groves, gardens, statues, fountains, shrines, temples, music, processions, shows - and which were in consequence frequented both day and night by a multitude of votaries. And burneth incense upon altars of brick; literally, upon the bricks. It is not clear that \"altars\" are intended. More probably the incense was burnt upon the tiled or bricked roofs of houses, where the Jews of Jeremiah's time \"burned incense unto all the host of heaven\" (Jeremiah 19:13; Jeremiah 32:29; Zephaniah 1:5). Brick altars are nowhere mentioned. The Assyrians and Babylonians made their altars of either stone or metal ('Ancient Monarchies,' vol. 2. pp. 36, 37; Herod., 1. 183). The Hebrews in early times had altars of earth (Exodus 20:24). The \"altar of incense\" in the tabernacle (Exodus 30:1-3) was of wood plated with gold; that of burnt offering, of wood plated with bronze (Exodus 27:1, 2). Solomon's altars were similar. Elijah on one occasion made an altar of twelve rough stones (1 Kings 18:31). The Assyrians used polished stone, as did the Greeks and Romans.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah65:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWhich remain among the graves, and lodge in the monuments, which eat swine's flesh, and broth of abominable things is in their vessels;VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 4. - Which remain among the graves. The rock tombs of Palestine seem to be meant. Persons \"remained among\" these, in spite of the ceremonial defilement thereby incurred, either with the object of raising the dead, and obtaining prophecies from them, or of getting prophetic intimations made to them in dreams (see Jerome's 'Comment.,' ad loc.). And lodge in the monuments; or, in the crypts. \"N'tsurim may refer to the mysteries celebrated in natural caves and artificial crypts\" (Delitzsch). An account of such mysteries is given by Chwolsohn in his' Die Ssabier und der Ssabismus,' vol. it. pp. 332, et seq. Which eat swine's flesh. Not in mere defiance of the Law, but in sacrificial meals (Isaiah 66:17) of which swine's flesh formed a part. Swine were sacrificial animals in Egypt (Herod., 2:47, 48), in Phoenicia (Lucian, 'De Dea Syra,' § 54), and with the Greeks and Romans. They do not appear to have been employed for the purpose either by the Assyrians or the Babylonians. It was probably in Palestine that the Jews had eaten \"swine's flesh,\" at sacrifices to Baal or Astarte (Ashtoreth). In later times to do so was regarded as one of the worst abominations (1 Macc. 1:41-64; 2 Macc, 6. and 7.). Broth of abominable things. Either broth made from swine's flesh, or from the flesh of other unclean animals, as the hare and rabbit (Leviticus 11:5, 6), or perhaps simply broth made from the flesh of any animals that had been offered to idols (Acts 15:29).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah65:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWhich say, Stand by thyself, come not near to me; for I am holier than thou. These are a smoke in my nose, a fire that burneth all the day.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 5. - Stand by thyself; i.e. \"keep aloof - come not into contact with me; for mine is a higher holiness than thine, and I should be polluted by thy near approach.\" Initiation into heathen mysteries was thought to confer on the initiated a holiness unattainable otherwise. Thus the heathenized Jew claimed to be holier than the true servants of Jehovah. These are a smoke... a fire (comp. Psalm 18:8, \"There went up a smoke out of his nostrils, and fire out of his mouth devoured; coals were kindled by it\"). The heathenized Jews are fuel for the wrath of God, which kindles a fire wherein they burn continually (comp. Isaiah 66:24).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah65:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBehold, it is written before me: I will not keep silence, but will recompense, even recompense into their bosom,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 6. - It is written before me. The misconduct of his people is \"written\" in God's book, which lies open \"before him,\" so that their sin is ever in his sight (comp. Psalm 56:8; Malachi 3:16; Revelation 20:12). I will not keep silence (comp. Psalm 1:3). \"Keeping silence\" is a metaphor for complete inaction. But will recompense, etc.; rather, until I have recompensed, yea, recompensed [them] into their bosoms (comp. Luke 6:38). Gifts were given and received into the fold of the beged, or cloak, which depended in front of the bosom.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah65:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTYour iniquities, and the iniquities of your fathers together, saith the LORD, which have burned incense upon the mountains, and blasphemed me upon the hills: therefore will I measure their former work into their bosom.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 7. - Your iniquities. This is a new sentence, not a continuation of ver. 6, which should be closed by a full stop. It is an incomplete sentence, needing for its completion the repetition of the verb shillamti, \"I will recompense.\" Which have burned incense upon the mountains (see 2 Kings 17:11; Hosea 4:13; Ezekiel 6:13; and comp. Isaiah 57:7). And blasphemed me; rather, reproached me (see Isaiah 37:4, 17, 23, 24). Therefore will I measure their former work; rather, therefore will r, first of all, measure their work into their bosom. The expression, \"first of all,\" prepares the way for the encouraging promises of vers. 8-10.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah65:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThus saith the LORD, As the new wine is found in the cluster, and one saith, Destroy it not; for a blessing is in it: so will I do for my servants' sakes, that I may not destroy them all.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 8-10. - SALVATION PROMISED TO A REMNANT. In Isaiah, and especially in the \"Book of Consolation\" (Isaiah 40-66.), promises are almost always intermingled with threatenings. The threats extend to the bulk of the nation; the promises are limited to \"a remnant,\" since a remnant only could be brought to \"seek\" and serve God (ver. 10). Here the announcement that a remnant would be spared is introduced by a simile from men's treatment of their own vineyards (ver. 8). Verse 8. - As the new wine is found in the cluster; rather, as when new wine is found in a grape-bunch; i.e. as when even a single cluster of grapes is spied on a vine-stem, the vine-pruners say one to another, \"Destroy not that stem, but spare it,\" so will God refrain from destroying those stocks in his vineyard, which give even a small promise of bearing good fruit. Destroy it not. The words are thought to be those of a well-known vintage-song, which is perhaps alluded to in the heading (Al-taschith) prefixed to Psalm 57, 58, and 59. \"Each of these psalms was probably sung to the air of this favourite song\" (Cheyne). A blessing is in it; i.e. \"a boon from God\" (comp. Isaiah 36:16; 2 Kings 5:15).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah65:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd I will bring forth a seed out of Jacob, and out of Judah an inheritor of my mountains: and mine elect shall inherit it, and my servants shall dwell there.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 9. - A seed out of Jacob, and out of Judah. Scarcely, \"the people of the two captivities\" (Delitzsch), though no doubt many Israelites of the ten tribes did return with Zerubbabel (1 Chronicles 9:3; Ezra 2:2, 70; Ezra 3:1; Ezra 6:17; Ezra 8:35, etc.). Rather, a mere pleonasm, as in Isaiah 9:8; Isaiah 10:21, 22; Isaiah 27:6; Isaiah 29:23; Isaiah 40:27; Isaiah 41:8, etc. (see the comment on Isaiah 40:27). An inheritor of my mountains. The whole of Palestine is little more than a cluster of mountains. The cluster may be divided into three groups:NEWLINENEWLINE(1) The mountains of Galilee, extending from Hermon to Tabor, separated from the next group by the plain of Esdraelon;NEWLINENEWLINE(2) the mountains of Samaria and Judaea, extending from Carmel and Gilbea to the plateau of Mature above Hebron, which is 3600 feet above the sea;NEWLINENEWLINE(3) the mountains of the trans-Jordanic region, including those of Bashan, Gilead, Moab, and Edom, separated from the two other groups by the Jordan valley. The highest elevation attained is that of Hermon (9400 feet); other minor heights are Jebel Jurmuk, in Galilee, 4000 feet; Safed, also in Galilee, 2775 feet; Ebal and Gerizim, in Samaria, 2700 feet; Sinjil, 2685; Neby Samwill, 2650; and the Mount of Olives, 2724 feet. The plateau of Mature reaches a height of 3600 feet. The only Palestinian plains are those of Esdraelon, Sharon, and the Ghor, or Jordan valley. Thus the land may well be spoken of as \"my mountains.\" Mine elect (comp. ch. 43:20; 45:4). The same expression is used of Israel in 1 Chronicles 16:13; Psalm 89:3; Psalm 105:6, 43; Psalm 106:5. God \"chose\" Israel out of all the nations of the earth to be his \"peculiar people.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah65:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Sharon shall be a fold of flocks, and the valley of Achor a place for the herds to lie down in, for my people that have sought me.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 10. - Sharon shall be a fold of flocks. \"Sharon,\" instead of being \"like a wilderness\" (Isaiah 33:9), shall once more be \"a place for flocks \" - a rich pasture for the flocks and herds of the returned exiles. (On the position and fertility of Sharon, see the comment upon Isaiah 33:9.) The valley of Achor (see Joshua 7:24-26). The 'Emeq 'Akor was near Jericho. The two places seem to be selected on account of their position, one on the eastern, the other on the western border. My people that have sought me; or, inquired of me - the same verb as that used at the beginning of the chapter.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah65:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut ye are they that forsake the LORD, that forget my holy mountain, that prepare a table for that troop, and that furnish the drink offering unto that number.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 11-16. - A MIXTURE OF THREATS WITH PROMISES. The prophet returns, in the main, to his former attitude, and resumes his denunciations (vers. 11, 12); but, with ver. 13, he begins to intermingle promises of favour to God's servants with threats against the rebellious, and finally (in ver. 16) turns wholly towards the side of grace and favour, announcing the coming of a time when \"the former troubles\" will be altogether \"forgotten,\" and the kingdom of truth and right will be established. Verse 11. - But ye are they that forsake the Lord; rather, but as for you who forsake the Lord. And forget my holy mountain; i.e. either, literally, forget Zion. being absent from it so long (Psalm 137:5), or, possibly, neglect Zion, though you might worship there if you pleased. That prepare a table for that troop; rather, that prepare a table for Gad. There is ground for believing that \"Gad\" was a Phoenician deity, perhaps \"the god of good fortune\" (Cheyne), though this is not clearly ascertained; sometimes worshipped as an aspect of Baal, whence the name, Baal-Gad (Joshua 11:17; Joshua 12:7); sometimes connected with other deities, as Moloch and Ashtoreth. The practice of \"preparing tables\" for the heathen gods was a common one, and appears in Herod., 1:181; in Baruch 6:30; in Bel and the Dragon, ver. 11; and in the Roman lectisternia. The tables prepared for the dead in Egyptian tombs were not very different, and implied a qualified worship of ancestors (Rawlinson, 'History of Ancient Egypt,' vol. 1. pp. 423, 424; vol. 2 p. 39). And that furnish the drink offering unto that number; rather, and that fill up mixed drink for M'ni. M'ni appears, like Gad, to have been a Syrian deity, the name Ebed-M'ni, \"servant of M'ni,\" occurring on Aramaeo-Persian coins of the Achaemenian period (Rodiger, in 'Addenda to Gesenius' Thesaurus,' p. 97). The word may be suspected to be cognate to the Arabic \"Manat,\" a god recognized in the Koran as a mediator with Allah; but can scarcely have any connection with the Aryan names for the moon deity, Μήν Μήνη, Mena, and the like. Its root is probably the Semitic manah, \"to number\" or\" apportion,\" the word designating a deity who\" apportions\" men's fortunes to them (τύχη, LXX.).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah65:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTTherefore will I number you to the sword, and ye shall all bow down to the slaughter: because when I called, ye did not answer; when I spake, ye did not hear; but did evil before mine eyes, and did choose that wherein I delighted not.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 12. - Therefore will I number you; or, apportion you (maaithi) - a play upon the name of M'ni. The sword... slaughter. Not, perhaps, intended literally. Wicked men are God's sword (Psalm 17:13), and deliverance into their hand would be deliverance to the sword and slaughter. The exiles suffered grievously at the hands of their Babylonian masters (Isaiah 47:6; Isaiah 49:17, etc.). The character of their sufferings is given in the ensuing verses (vers. 13, 14). When I called, ye did not answer (see 2 Chronicles 36:15, 16; Proverbs 1:20-25; Isaiah 66:4).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah65:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTTherefore thus saith the Lord GOD, Behold, my servants shall eat, but ye shall be hungry: behold, my servants shall drink, but ye shall be thirsty: behold, my servants shall rejoice, but ye shall be ashamed:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 13. - Therefore thus saith the Lord God; rather, thus saith the Lord Jehovah (comp. Isaiah 7:7; Isaiah 25:8; Isaiah 28:16; Isaiah 30:15; Isaiah 40:10; Isaiah 48:16; Isaiah 49:22; I. 4, 5, 7, 9; 52:4; 56:8; 61:1, etc.). My servants shall eat, but ye shall be hungry, etc. This entire series of contrasts may be understood in two ways; literally, of the two classes of exiles, the religious and the irreligious; metaphorically, of God's servants and his adversaries at all times and in all places. The religious exiles would return to the land of promise as soon as permitted, and would there prosper in a worldly sense - have abundance to eat and drink, rejoice, and sing for joy (Ezra 3:11-13). The irreligious, remaining in Babylonia, would suffer hunger and thirst, endure shame, cry and howl for sorrow and vexation of spirit. This would be one fulfilment of the prophecy; but there would also be another. God's servants at all times and in all places would be sustained with spiritual food, and \"rejoice and sing for joy of heart.\" His adversaries would everywhere feel a craving for the \"meat\" and \"drink,\" which alone satisfy the soul, and would be oppressed with care, and with a sense of shame, and suffer anguish of spirit.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah65:14VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBehold, my servants shall sing for joy of heart, but ye shall cry for sorrow of heart, and shall howl for vexation of spirit.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah65:15VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd ye shall leave your name for a curse unto my chosen: for the Lord GOD shall slay thee, and call his servants by another name:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 15. - Ye shall leave your name for a curse (comp. Jeremiah 29:22). In their formulas of imprecation the Jews were in the habit of saying, \"The Lord make thee like\" this or that person, or this or that class of persons. The name of the exiles should be used in this manner. Unto my chosen (see the comment on ver. 9). The Lord God shall slay thee (see the comment on ver. 12). Some, however, take the words as part of the formula of imprecation. And call his servants by another name (compare what is said of \"new name\" in Isaiah 62:2).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah65:16VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThat he who blesseth himself in the earth shall bless himself in the God of truth; and he that sweareth in the earth shall swear by the God of truth; because the former troubles are forgotten, and because they are hid from mine eyes.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 16. - That he who blesseth himself; rather, so that he who blesses himself. The sequence of the argument is not altogether clear. Perhaps it is recant that God will call them by his own Name (Amos 9:12) - \"the people of God\" (Hebrews 4:9); and thence it will become natural for them to use no other name, either when they call for a blessing on themselves, or have to confirm a covenant with others. In the God of truth; literally, in the God of the Amen; i.e. the God who keeps covenant and promise, to which the strongest formula of consent was the word \"Amen\" (see Numbers 5:22; Deuteronomy 27:15-26; 1 Kings 1:36, etc.). Similarly, St. John calls our Lord \"the Amen, the Faithful and True Witness\" (Revelation 3:14). Because the former troubles are forgotten. When the blessed time has come wherein men call themselves by the Name of the Lord, and know of only one God as the Source of blessing and the confirmation of an oath, then the former state of human affairs, with all its \"troubles,\" will have passed away, and the new era will be inaugurated, which the prophet proceeds to describe at length (vers. 17-25).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah65:17VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor, behold, I create new heavens and a new earth: and the former shall not be remembered, nor come into mind.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 17-25. - A PROMISE OF NEW HEAVENS AND A NEW EARTH. The final answer of God to the complaint and prayer of his people (ch. 64.) is now given. The entire existing state of things is to pass away. God will create a new heaven and a new earth, and place his people therein; and the old conditions will be all changed, and the old grounds of complaint disappear. In the \"new Jerusalem\" there will be no sorrow, neither \"weeping\" nor \"crying\" (ver. 19); life will be greatly prolonged (ver. 20); men will always enjoy the fruit of their labours (vers. 21, 22), and see their children grow up (ver. 23). Prayer will be answered almost before it is uttered (ver. 24). Finally, there will be peace in the animal world, and between the animal world and man. No living thing will kill or hurt another in all God's \"holy mountain\" (ver. 25). Verse 17. - I create. The same verb is used as in Genesis 1:1; and the prophet's idea seems to be that the existing heaven and earth are to be entirely destroyed (see Isaiah 24:19, 20, and the comment ad loc.), and a fresh heaven and earth created in their place out of nothing. The \"new Jerusalem\" is not the old Jerusalem renovated, but is a veritable \"new Jerusalem,\" \"created a rejoicing\" (ver. 18; scrap. Revelation 21:2). The germ of the teaching will be found in Isaiah 51:16. The former shall not be remembered. Some suppose \"the former troubles\" (see ver. 16) to be meant; but it is best (with Delitzsch) to understand \"the former heavens and earth.\" The glory of the new heavens and earth would be such that the former ones would not only not be regretted, but would not even be had in remembrance. No one would so much as think of them.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah65:18VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut be ye glad and rejoice for ever in that which I create: for, behold, I create Jerusalem a rejoicing, and her people a joy.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 18. - I create Jerusalem (comp. Revelation 21:2, \"I, John, saw the holy city, new Jerusalem, coming down from God out of heaven, prepared as a bride adorned for her husband\"). The description which follows in vers. 11, 12 is quite unlike that of the old Jerusalem. A rejoicing. The \"new Jerusalem\" was to be from the first all joy and rejoicing - a scene of perpetual gladness. Her people also was to be \"a joy\" or \"a delight,\" since God would delight in them (ver. 19).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah65:19VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd I will rejoice in Jerusalem, and joy in my people: and the voice of weeping shall be no more heard in her, nor the voice of crying.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 19. - The voice of weeping shall be no more heard (comp. Revelation 21:4). The reasons there given are satisfactory: \"There shall be no more death, neither sorrow... neither shall there be any more pain.\" But these reasons scarcely apply here. For Isaiah's \"new Jerusalem\" is not without death (ver. 20), nor without sorrow, since it is not without sin (ver. 20), nor, as there is death there, is it without pain. Isaiah's picture, according to Delitzsch, represents the millennial state, not the final condition of the redeemed; but this trait - the absence of all weeping - can only be literally true of the final state.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah65:20VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThere shall be no more thence an infant of days, nor an old man that hath not filled his days: for the child shall die an hundred years old; but the sinner being an hundred years old shall be accursed.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 20. - There shall be no more thence an infant of days; i.e. there shall not go from the new Jerusalem into the unseen world any infant of a few days old. On the contrary, even \"the youth\" shall reach a hundred; i.e. one who dies when he is a hundred shall be regarded as cut off in his youth. The general rule shall be, that old men shall \"fill their days,\" or attain to patriarchal longevity. Even the sinner, who is under the curse of God, shall not be cut off till he is a hundred. What is most remarkable in the description is that death and sin are represented as still continuing. Death was spoken of as \"swallowed up in victory\" in one of the earlier descriptions of Messiah's kingdom (Isaiah 25:8).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah65:21VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd they shall build houses, and inhabit them; and they shall plant vineyards, and eat the fruit of them.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 21. - They shall build houses, and inhabit them. The curse pronounced on apostasy in Deuteronomy 28:30 shall no more rest on God's people. They shall have the fruition of their labours. No enemy shall be able to deprive them of their crops and houses.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah65:22VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThey shall not build, and another inhabit; they shall not plant, and another eat: for as the days of a tree are the days of my people, and mine elect shall long enjoy the work of their hands.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 22. - As the days of a tree are the days of my people. Trees endure for many hundreds, perhaps for thousands of years. The cedars of Lebanon, the oaks of Bashan, were known to have an antiquity of centuries. Isaiah may have had a knowledge of other trees to which attached the tradition of a yet longer existence. In our own day Brazil and California have furnished proofs of vegetable growths exceeding a millennium. Mine elect shall long enjoy; literally, shall wear out; i.e. have the full use and enjoyment of the work of their hands.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah65:23VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThey shall not labour in vain, nor bring forth for trouble; for they are the seed of the blessed of the LORD, and their offspring with them.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 23. - They shall not... bring forth for trouble. Their women shall not bear children to see them carried off after a few days, or months, or years, by disease, or accident, or famine, or the sword of the invader. There shall be an end of such \"troubles,\" and, God's blessing resting upon those who are his children, their children shall, as a general rule, \"be with them;\" i.e. remain to them during their lifetime, and not be lost to them by a premature decease.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah65:24VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd it shall come to pass, that before they call, I will answer; and while they are yet speaking, I will hear.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 24. - Before they call, I will answer. God is always \"more ready to hear than we to pray.\" In the \"new Jerusalem\" he will be prompt to answer his people's prayers almost before they are uttered. It is involved in this, as Delitzsch notes, that the will of the people shall be in harmony with the will of Jehovah, and that their prayers will therefore be acceptable prayers.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah65:25VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe wolf and the lamb shall feed together, and the lion shall eat straw like the bullock: and dust shall be the serpent's meat. They shall not hurt nor destroy in all my holy mountain, saith the LORD.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 25. - The wolf and the lamb shall feed together (comp. Isaiah 11:6-8; Hosea 2:18). The portraiture here is far less elaborate than in the earlier chapter, to which the present passage may be regarded as a refer-once. (For the sense in which the entire picture is to be understood, see the comment upon Isaiah 11:6-9). Dust shall be the serpent's meat. Here we have a new feature, not contained in the earlier description. Serpents shall become harmless, anal instead of preying upon beasts, or birds, or reptiles, shall be content with the food assigned them in the primeval decree, \"Upon thy belly shalt thou go, and dust shalt thou eat all the days of thy life\" (Genesis 3:14). Mr. Cheyne appositely notes that \"much dust is the food of the shades in the Assyrio-Babylonian Hades\" (see the \"Legend of Ishtar\" in the 'Records of the Past,' vol. 1. p. 143, line 8). They shall not hurt nor destroy. Repeated from Isaiah 11:9, word for word. In neither case should we regard the subject of the sentence as limited to the animals only. The meaning is that there shall be no violence of any kind, done either by man or beast, in the happy period described.NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINE","Isa.66":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah66:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThus saith the LORD, The heaven is my throne, and the earth is my footstool: where is the house that ye build unto me? and where is the place of my rest?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 1-4. - THE UNGODLY EXILES REBUKED. Israel, being about to return from the Captivity, had the design of rebuilding the temple and re-establishing the temple worship. God rebukes this design in persons devoid of any spirit of holiness, and warns them that mere formal outward worship is an abomination to him (vers. 1-3). In ver. 4 he threatens them with punishment. Verse 1. - Heaven is my throne, and the earth is my footstool (comp. Psalm 11:4; Psalm 103:19). The Hebrews, while they earnestly desired to have a material emblem of the presence of God in their midst, were deeply impressed with the feeling that no temple could be worthy of him, or other than most unworthy. \"Will God,\" said Solomon, \"indeed dwell on the earth? behold, the heaven and heavens of heavens cannot contain thee; how much less this house that I have builded?\" (1 Kings 8:27). And again, \"Who is able to build him an house, seeing the heaven and heaven of heavens cannot contain him? Who am I then, that I should build him an house, save only to burn sacrifice before trim?\" (2 Chronicles 2:6). Thus Isaiah's note of warning was no novelty, and might rind responsive echoes in the hearts of many. Where is the house that ye build unto me? rather, what manner of house is it that ye would build to me, add what manner of place for my rest? God needs no \"house;\" and they cannot build him a house that could be in any way worthy of him. They, moreover, are unworthy to build him any house, which is the real ground of the refusal. There was no refusal, when the better part of the exiles, having returned, took the building in hand (see Ezra 3:8-13; Ezra 6:14, 15; Haggai 1:8-14; Zechariah 1:16; Zechariah 4:9, etc.).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah66:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor all those things hath mine hand made, and all those things have been, saith the LORD: but to this man will I look, even to him that is poor and of a contrite spirit, and trembleth at my word.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 2. - All these things - i.e. heaven and earth hath mine hand made; i.e. have I, Jehovah, brought into existence. How, then, can I need that men should build me a house? All these things have been, saith the Lord. The sentence seems incomplete. Mr. Cheyne supplies, \"I spoke.\" The sentence will then run, \"I spoke, and all these things crone into being, saith Jehovah;\" i.e. heaven and earth, and all things that are therein, came into being at my word (comp. Genesis 1:1; Genesis 2:1). But to this man will I look; i.e. though I have made all things and all men, I will not equally regard all. Him only will I respect who is of a poor and contrite spirit, etc. (comp. Isaiah 57:15).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah66:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHe that killeth an ox is as if he slew a man; he that sacrificeth a lamb, as if he cut off a dog's neck; he that offereth an oblation, as if he offered swine's blood; he that burneth incense, as if he blessed an idol. Yea, they have chosen their own ways, and their soul delighteth in their abominations.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 3. - He that killeth an ox is as if he slew a man; literally, is a manslayer. The full meaning seems to be, \"He that, not being of a poor and contrite spirit, would offer me an ox in sacrifice, is as little pleasing to me as a murderer.\" Sacrifice, without the true spirit of sacrifice, is an abomination (comp. Isaiah 1:11, \"To what purpose is the multitude of your sacrifices unto me? saith the Lord,\" etc.). There, however, the sacrifices are actually offered; here they are hypothetical. The ungodly exiles design to offer sacrifice to God in his temple, when they have rebuilt it (ver. 1). God rejects their offerings by anticipation. As if he out off a dog's neck; i.e.\" would no more please me by the sacrifice than if he were to make an offering of the unclean dog.\" (On the uncleanness of the dog, see Deuteronomy 23:18.) He that offereth an oblation; or, a meat offering (see Leviticus 2:1-15). He that burneth incense. With his meat offering, as directed in Leviticus 2:1, 2. Such a one is no better than he that blesseth (i.e. worships) an idol. It may be suspected that the ritual acts selected for comparison with those of the Levitical law are practices to which the exiles were given (comp. Isaiah 65:3, 4). Yea, they have chosen, etc.; rather, as they haw chosen. The clause stands over against the first clause of ver. 4, \"As they (gain hemmah) have chosen their ways, so I (gain ani) have chosen their delusions.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah66:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTI also will choose their delusions, and will bring their fears upon them; because when I called, none did answer; when I spake, they did not hear: but they did evil before mine eyes, and chose that in which I delighted not.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 4. - Their delusions; or, their childish follies (LXX., ἐμπαίγματα). As God sends on some men \"strong delusion that they should believe a lie\" (2 Thessalonians 2:11), so on others he sends a spirit of childish folly, which makes their conduct silly and headstrong. Persons whose characters are of this stamp are especially liable to vain and groundless \"fears.\" When I called, none did answer (comp. Isaiah 65:12, and see the comment on that passage).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah66:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHear the word of the LORD, ye that tremble at his word; Your brethren that hated you, that cast you out for my name's sake, said, Let the LORD be glorified: but he shall appear to your joy, and they shall be ashamed.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 5-14. - THE GODLY EXILES ENCOURAGED. The scoffs which have long greeted those who believed God's promises and expected the restoration of Zion, will be put to shame. The silence in which Zion has lain will be broken; she will be once more a city \"full of stirs, a tumultuous city\" (Isaiah 22:2). Suddenly, without any pains of travail, she will bring forth; and her offspring will be \"a nation born at once\" (ver. 8). The godly exiles are called upon to rejoice at the prospect (ver. 10), and promised peace and comfort in the restored city (vers. 11-14). Verse 5. - Hear... ye that tremble. The godly are addressed - those that have a reverent fear of God's word (comp. ver. 2, ad fin.; and see also Ezra 9:4; Ezra 10:3). Your brethren that... cast you out; rather. that put you away (Cheyne), or thrust you from them (Delitzsch). The verb used came in later times to designate formal excommunication; but here it points merely to a practical renunciation of fellowship. Said, Let the Lord be glorified: but he shall appear to your joy; rather, said, Let Jehovah glorify himself, that ice may see your joy; i.e. \"said sarcastically, May the prophecies be fulfilled, and God humble Babylon, and release Israel, and restore her, that we may witness your rejoicing. We should gladly see all this; but we do not in the least expect it.\" And they shall be ashamed; rather, but as for them (i.e. those who so speak) they shall be ashamed. The event shall shame them.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah66:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTA voice of noise from the city, a voice from the temple, a voice of the LORD that rendereth recompence to his enemies.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 6. - A voice of noise from the city... from the temple. The \"city\" and \"temple\" are suddenly in existence - they have sprung into being. The prophet sees Jerusalem rebuilt, restored, and hears sounds go forth from it - partly, perhaps, the sounds of ordinary city life; but amid these, there is a voice of the Lord, rendering recompense to his enemies. The Jewish state, restored by Zerubbabel, did, after a time, bring under subjection several of its ancient adversaries.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah66:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBefore she travailed, she brought forth; before her pain came, she was delivered of a man child.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 7, 8. - Before she travailed, etc. Without any long delay, without any labour pains, Zion will bring forth a man-child - a whole nation, which wilt be born at once, and not grow up by slow degrees. The occupation of Jerusalem by the great body of the returned exiles (Ezra 2:1; Ezra 3:1) is intended. Such a second birth of a nation was strange, and without precedent (comp. Isaiah 42:9; Isaiah 43:19). Shall the earth be made to bring forth in one day? rather, can a land be brought forth in one day? It is not only a people, but a country, that is born anew; not only the Jews, but Judaea.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah66:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWho hath heard such a thing? who hath seen such things? Shall the earth be made to bring forth in one day? or shall a nation be born at once? for as soon as Zion travailed, she brought forth her children.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah66:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTShall I bring to the birth, and not cause to bring forth? saith the LORD: shall I cause to bring forth, and shut the womb? saith thy God.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 9. - Shall I bring to the birth, etc.? i.e. \"Should I arrange all the preliminary circumstances for the restoration of my people, and stop there?\" (Cheyne). Nay, should I, having done so much, interpose at the last moment, to shut the womb? Without such interposition, matters have progressed so far, that the result must come.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah66:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTRejoice ye with Jerusalem, and be glad with her, all ye that love her: rejoice for joy with her, all ye that mourn for her:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 10. - Rejoice ye with Jerusalem... all ye that love her. The call to rejoicing is general. Restored Jerusalem is to be hailed with joy \"by all who love her,\" whether her own children or foreigners. To both she will be a blessing (vers. 11-13).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah66:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThat ye may suck, and be satisfied with the breasts of her consolations; that ye may milk out, and be delighted with the abundance of her glory.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 11. - That ye may suck. Restored Jerusalem will be as a mother to all who love her, to all who have mourned for her when she lay as it were dead (1 Samuel 15:35; 2 Samuel 14:2). She will have \"milk\" to give to all - \"the sincere milk of the Word\" (1 Peter 2:2) - and from her both Jew and Gentile will \"suck out no small advantage\" (Psalm 73:10). She will also impart to them from the abundance of her glory.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah66:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor thus saith the LORD, Behold, I will extend peace to her like a river, and the glory of the Gentiles like a flowing stream: then shall ye suck, ye shall be borne upon her sides, and be dandled upon her knees.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 12. - I will extend peace to her like a river; literally, I will direct peace to her, like a river. The waters of streams are in the East directed hither and thither by the agriculturist. God would have given his people \"peace, as a river,\" long previously, had they permitted him (Isaiah 48:18). And the glory of the Gentiles (comp. Isaiah 60:5, 11; Isaiah 61:6, etc.). Like a flowing stream; literally, as an overflowing torrent. There is perhaps a contrast intended between the former and the latter times. In the former times Assyria had swept over Israel like an overwhelming flood to destroy her (Isaiah 8:7, 8); now the glory of the whole Gentile world should similarly overflow and overwhelm, but only to enrich and exalt. Ye shall be borne upon her sides (see the comment on Isaiah 9:4). It is Jerusalem, and not the Gentile world (Delitzsch, Cheyne), that will thus care for and caress her children. The continuance of the metaphor from ver. 11 is marked by the repetition of the verb, \"ye shall suck.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah66:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAs one whom his mother comforteth, so will I comfort you; and ye shall be comforted in Jerusalem.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 13. - As one; literally, as a man. Israel is now looked upon as grown up, and receiving comfort from God himself in Jerusalem.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah66:14VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd when ye see this, your heart shall rejoice, and your bones shall flourish like an herb: and the hand of the LORD shall be known toward his servants, and his indignation toward his enemies.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 14. - Your bones shall flourish like an herb (comp. Isaiah 58:11). In the time of calamity, Israel's \"bones\" have been \"consumed\" (Psalm 31:10), and \"waxed old\" (Psalm 32:3), and \"burned with heat\" (Job 30:30). Now they shall enjoy a time of refreshing from the Lord. New life shall enter them, and health and growth shall follow. The nation shall be rejuvenated, and \"flourish\" in more than its pristine strength. The hand of the Lord shall be known; or recognized, both in this merciful treatment of his servants, and also in the indignation with which he will visit his enemies. This last clause conveniently introduces the following \"theophany\" (vers. 15-1S).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah66:15VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor, behold, the LORD will come with fire, and with his chariots like a whirlwind, to render his anger with fury, and his rebuke with flames of fire.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 15-18. - THE VENGEANCE WHICH GOD WILL TAKE ON HIS ENEMIES. A signal outpouring of God's vengeance upon his enemies precedes the settlement of the Church in its final glorious condition, both in Isaiah and in the Revelation of St. John (see ch. 34, 35, and Revelation 19-21.). The wicked have to be removed before the righteous can be established in peace. Here the agencies employed against the wicked are \"fire\" and \"sword\" - fire pointing (as Delitzsch remarks) to destructive occurrences of nature, and the sword to destructive occurrences of history. God himself is represented as guiding and directing both agencies, to the punishment of the ungodly and the relief of those who trust in him. Verse 15. - Behold, the Lord will come with fire. \"Fire\" is a usual accompaniment of a \"theophany.\" God descended on Sinai \"in fire\" (Exodus 19:18), and led the Israelites through the wilderness by the pillar of the cloud and of fire (Exodus 13:21, 22), and filled the tabernacle with a glory as of fire (Exodus 40:34), and \"answered David from heaven by fire upon the altar of burnt offering\" (1 Chronicles 21:26), and in the same way answered Solomon (2 Chronicles 7:1) and Elijah (1 Kings 18:38). Isaiah almost always describes a theophany as a \"coming with fire\" (see Isaiah 10:16-18; Isaiah 27:4; Isaiah 29:6; Isaiah 30:27, 30; Isaiah 33:12, 14, etc.). The agency of fire in the judgment that will overtake the wicked simultaneously with Christ's second coming, appears in 2 Thessalonians 1:8; 2 Peter 3:7-10. With his chariots (comp. Psalm 68:17; Habakkuk 3:8). \"Chariots,\" in the plural, may be regarded as symbolizing the \"hosts\" of natural and supernatural forces that God has at his command (Cheyne). Like a whirlwind. The whirring of the wheels of chariots, their noise, the swiftness of their pace, and the destruction that they cause, make this simile most appropriate. To render his anger; or, to expend his anger - to vent it.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah66:16VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor by fire and by his sword will the LORD plead with all flesh: and the slain of the LORD shall be many.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 16. - By fire and by his sword (see the introductory paragraph). The \"sword of Jehovah\" is spoken of also in Isaiah 27:1 and Isaiah 34:5, 6 (comp. Revelation 19:15, 21). Will the Lord plead with all flesh; rather, will the Lord judge all flesh (comp. Jeremiah 25:31, where the same phrase occurs).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah66:17VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThey that sanctify themselves, and purify themselves in the gardens behind one tree in the midst, eating swine's flesh, and the abomination, and the mouse, shall be consumed together, saith the LORD.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 17. - They that sanctify... themselves in the gardens (comp. Isaiah 1:29; Isaiah 65:3; and see the comment on the latter passage). Behind one tree in the midst; literally, behind one in the midst. It seems quite impossible that \"one\" can mean \"one tree,\" when no tree has been mentioned, and gardens do not necessarily contain trees. The marginal rendering, \"one after another,\" is also impossible. The \"one in the midst\" must have been either a hierophant who directed the ceremonies (Gesenius, Hitzig, Knobel, Delitzsch), or an image of a deity (Scaliger, Voss, Grotius, Lagarde, Cheyne). In the latter case, we must suppose that the worshippers had a scruple about mentioning the deity's name, and were accustomed to call him \"one,\" or \"a certain one\" (comp. Herod., 2:171). Isaiah adopts their usage. Eating swine's flesh (comp. Isaiah 65:4). And the abomination. The word is used generically of all the \"abominable things\" forbidden to be eaten in Leviticus 11:4-30, as the camel, the coney, the hare, the eagle, the vulture, the ferret, the chameleon, the lizard, etc. The mouse. Probably the jerboa (see Leviticus 11:20).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah66:18VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor I know their works and their thoughts: it shall come, that I will gather all nations and tongues; and they shall come, and see my glory.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 18. - For I know their works. There is no verb in the Hebrew text, from which something has evidently fallen out. Mr. Cheyne supplies, \"I will punish;\" Gratz, \"I have seen.\" \"I know\" is supported by the Targums, the Syriac Version, several manuscripts of the Septuagint, and the authorities of Saadiya, Vitringa, and Gesenius. And their thoughts; i.e. I know, not only their works, but even the thoughts from which the works proceeded. It shall some; i.e. \"the time shall come.\" (For the full phrase, see Jeremiah 51:33; Ezekiel 7:7, 12.) All nations and tongues. This expression has been corn-pared with Daniel's \"kindreds and nations and languages\" (Daniel 3:4, 7, 29; Daniel 4:1; Daniel 5:19, etc.), and has been regarded as a sign of late authorship. But \"nations' and \"tongues\" are coupled together in Scripture as early as Genesis (Genesis 10:5, 20). They shall come, and see my glory; i.e. \"see the glory that I shall get me upon my enemies\" (vers. 15-17).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah66:19VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd I will set a sign among them, and I will send those that escape of them unto the nations, to Tarshish, Pul, and Lud, that draw the bow, to Tubal, and Javan, to the isles afar off, that have not heard my fame, neither have seen my glory; and they shall declare my glory among the Gentiles.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 19-24. - THE FINAL CONDITION OF THE CHURCH OF THE REDEEMED ON EARTH. When the enemies of God have been consumed, there shall go out from the Church missionaries, who shall convert the distant Gentiles, and unite them, and the Jews who dwell among them, into a single body of worshippers, which shall inhabit the new Jerusalem on equal terms, and join continually in a common worship of Jehovah. The awful destruction of the wicked, and their eternal sufferings, shall at the same time be held in remembrance. Verse 19. - I will set a sign among them. Dr. Kay suggests that the \"sign\" is the resurrection of our Lord, or possibly a miraculous manifestation of Christ which is to precede his coming in judgment. Mr. Cheyne, less venturesome, finds in the prophet's words merely a suggestion of \"some mysterious event, which he leaves his awestruck readers to imagine.\" Those that escape of them. Not, surely, those of God's enemies that survive the slaughter, but \"the remnant\" of Jews, that are not among God's enemies, and so \"escape.\" These shall be sent (as missionaries) to the distant nations; not literally to those enumerated, but to such as at the end of the world occupy a position which the nations mentioned occupied on Isaiah's horizon. Of these nations, Tarshish (Tartessus) was at the furthest limit westward, Pul and Lud, or rather Phut and Lud, at the furthest limit southward, Tubal and Javan at the furthest limit northward, Pul, which occurs nowhere else in Scripture as a geographic name, is almost certainly a wrong reading for Phut, which occurs in Genesis 10:6, and also three times (Jeremiah 46:9; Ezekiel 27:10; Ezekiel 30:5) in connection with Lud. Phut designates an African nation, probably the Nubians, whom the Egyptians called Pet, and who were noted as bowmen. Wetstein's conjecture of \"Pun\" (Punici, 'Phoenicians '), commended by Mr. Cheyne, is quite unsupported and highly improbable. Lud. It is tempting to connect \"Lud\" with the Lydians, who were certainly known as \"Lndi\" to the Assyrians of the time of Asshur-bani-pal (B.C. 669-626). But the other scriptural notices of \"Lud\" (Jeremiah 46:9; Ezekiel 27:10; Ezekiel 30:5), which uniformly connect it with Phut, point rather to an African people. See also Genesis 10:13, where the Ludim are a subdivision of the Egyptians. That draw the bow (comp. Jeremiah 46:9). To Tubal, and Javan. Tubal stands, no doubt, for the Tibareni, a people of the Asiatic highland west of the Upper Euphrates, called Tuplai or Tabali by the Assyrians. They would occupy Isaiah's northern and north-western horizon, in company with Javan, or the Ionians (Ἰάβονες), who were among the chief people of Asia Minor. Javan, Tubal, and Mesheeh (Μόσχοι, Muskai) are joined in Genesis 10:2 and Ezekiel 27:13. The isles afar off; i.e. the shores and islands of the Mediterranean.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah66:20VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd they shall bring all your brethren for an offering unto the LORD out of all nations upon horses, and in chariots, and in litters, and upon mules, and upon swift beasts, to my holy mountain Jerusalem, saith the LORD, as the children of Israel bring an offering in a clean vessel into the house of the LORD.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 20. - They shall bring all your brethren for an offering unto the Lord. When the distant Gentiles have been converted, they shall bring to Christ the Jews of the dispersion, who dwell with them in the remote parts of the earth (comp. Zephaniah 3:10). Upon horses. The \"new Jerusalem\" being localized, the converts from the distant regions are represented as journeying from their own lands to the \"holy mountain,\" and bringing the Jewish exiles with them by various methods of conveyance - upon horses, mules, and dromedaries, in chariots, and finally in palanquins or litters. \"Litters\" were used by the great men among the Egyptians from a very early date (see Rosellini, 'Monumenti Civili,' pl. 93, fig. 2; Wilkinson, ' Ancient Egyptians,' vol. 2. p. 208). They were also employed by the Persians (Herod., 3:146) and by the later Romans. As the children of Israel bring an offering; rather, bring the meat offering. The existence of the temple, and the continuance of the Levitical rites at the time of the delivery of this prophecy, are clearly implied.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah66:21VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd I will also take of them for priests and for Levites, saith the LORD.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 21. - And I will also take of them for priests and for Levites; literally, and I will also take of them unto the priests and unto the Levites; i.e. I will add to the existing body of priests and Levites, who are pro-sumably Jews, fresh members from the newly converted Gentiles. The existence of a sacerdotal order, with distinctions of ranks, in the Church of the redeemed, is implied, and the gracious declaration is made that the privilege of furnishing members to both ranks of the order shall be conferred upon the Gentile proselytes.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah66:22VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor as the new heavens and the new earth, which I will make, shall remain before me, saith the LORD, so shall your seed and your name remain.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 22. - As the new heavens and the new earth, which I will make, shall remain. The \"new heavens and the new earth,\" once created, continue for ever (comp. Revelation 21:1-27; Revelation 22:1-5). So shall your seed and your name remain. This statement is usually taken to be a promise of some special pre-eminence to the Jew over the Gentile in the final kingdom of the redeemed. But St. Paul speaks of all such privileges as already abolished in his day (Colossians 3:11); and, if the priesthood is to be common to both Gentile and Jew, the principle of equality would seem to be conceded. Perhaps no more is here meant than that, as the \"new heaven and new earth\" will always remain, so there will always remain a seed of true believers to worship God in them.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah66:23VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd it shall come to pass, that from one new moon to another, and from one sabbath to another, shall all flesh come to worship before me, saith the LORD.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 23. - From one new moon to another, and from one sabbath to another. Not that \"new moons\" and \"sabbaths\" will continue to be observed, for \"new moons\" have already lapsed, and \"sabbaths\" too will lapse when life is one perpetual sabbath passed in the worship of God. The phrase, used by the prophet is intended to express absolute continuance without an interval. Shall all flesh come to worship before me (comp. Psalm 65:2). The prophet still uses habitual modes of expression, though speaking of a time and circumstances to which they are no longer appropriate. \"The literal meaning,\" as Dr. Pusey says ('Prophecy of Jesus,' p. 39), \"was physically impossible.\" \"All flesh,\" in all regions of the \"new earth,\" could not worship in one spot, \"and so it was plain that Isaiah spoke of a worship other than that at any given place\" - of a worship such as that whereof our Lord spoke to the Samaritan woman, \"Woman, believe me, the hour cometh, when ye shall neither in this mountain, nor in Jerusalem, worship the Father\" (John 4:21).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah66:24VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd they shall go forth, and look upon the carcases of the men that have transgressed against me: for their worm shall not die, neither shall their fire be quenched; and they shall be an abhorring unto all flesh.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 24. - And they shall go forth, and look upon the carcases, etc. Here is more imagery, which it is impossible to understand literally. The carcases could not remain always to be looked at, nor while they remained could the sight of them be otherwise than loathsome to God's redeemed saints. Again, they could not be at the same time burnt with fire and eaten by worms. \"The prophet, by the very mode of description adopted by him, precludes the possibility of our conceiving of the thing set forth as realized in any material form in this present state. He is speaking of the future state, but in figures drawn from the present world\" (Delitzsch). Does he mean more than this - that the redeemed shall have in their thoughts, at any rate from time to time, the fact that, while they have by God's great mercy been saved and brought into His kingdom, there are those who have not been saved, but lie for ever under the awful sentence of God's wrath? This is a knowledge which the redeemed must have, and which may well produce a salutary effect on them, intensifying their gratitude and maintaining in them a spirit of reverent fear. Their worm shall not die, neither shall their fire be quenched (comp. Mark 9:44, 46, 48). It cannot be by chance that the evangelical prophet concludes his glorious prophecy with this terrible note of warning. Either he was divinely directed thus to terminate his teaching, or he felt the need that there was of his emphasizing all the many warnings dispersed throughout his \"book\" by a final, never-to-be-forgotten picture. The undying worm and the quenchless fire - images introduced by him - became appropriated thenceforth to the final condition of impenitent sinners (Jud. 16:17; Ecclus. 7:17), and were even adopted by our Lord himself in the same connection (Mark 9.). The incongruity of the two images shows that they are not to be understood literally; but both alike imply everlasting continuance, and are incompatible with either of the two modern heresies of universalism or annihilationism. They shall be an abhorring unto all flesh (comp. Daniel 12:2, where the word deraon is rendered \"contempt\"). The Jewish rabbis regarded it as anomalous that any portion of Scripture should conclude with words of ill omen. When, therefore, this chapter was read in the synagogue, or the last of Ecclesiastes, or Lamentations, or Malachi, they directed that after the reading of the last verse, the last verse but one should he repeated, to correct the sad impression that would otherwise have been left upon the mind. But Isaiah thought it salutary to leave this sad impression (comp. Isaiah 48:22; Isaiah 57:21).NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINE","Isa.6":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah6:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTIn the year that king Uzziah died I saw also the Lord sitting upon a throne, high and lifted up, and his train filled the temple.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 1-4. - THE VISION OF GOD SEEN BY ISAIAH. It is thought by some that this vision, and its sequel, constitute the original call of Isaiah to the prophetical office, and in order of time precede all the other contents of the book. But the position of the \"vision\" in the book is strongly against this view. Prophets who relate their original call naturally place it in the forefront of their narrative (Jeremiah 1:10; Ezekiel 1:1). It is quite possible, as Bishop Lowth says, that this was \"a new designation, to introduce more solemnly a general declaration of the whole course of God's dispensations in regard to his people, and the fates of the nations.\" The vision itself may profitably be compared with Ezekiel's first vision, which it much resembles (Ezekiel 1:4-28). Verse 1. - In the year that King Uzziah died. The year B.C. 759, probably. We cannot determine from the phrase used whether the vision was seen before or after Uzziah's death. I saw also; rather, then it was that I saw (comp. Exodus 16:6). The Lord. Not \"Jehovah,\" as in vers. 3 and 5, but \"Adonay,\" for greater reverence. Sitting upon a throne, high and lifted up. The imagery is, of course, taken from the practice of earthly kings. Elaborate thrones were affected by the great monarchs of Egypt and Assyria (Lepsius, 'Deutmaler,' pt. 3. pls. 2, 76, 100, 121; Layard, 'Nineveh and Babylon,' p. 150). Solomon's throne was perhaps even grander than any of these (see 1 Kings 10:18-20). It was placed at the summit of \"six steps,\" so that its occupant was \"high and lifted up\" above all his courtiers. His train. Not his train of attendants, but \"the skirts of his robe.\" Flowing robes were commonly worn by great monarchs. Filled the temple; or, the palace. The same word is used in Hebrew for both. Dr. Kay supposes the prophet to be \"in vision gazing on the actual temple - to see its veils drawn aside, and instead of the Shechinah enthroned on the cherubim, to behold the King of glory, enthroned on high, the fringes of his royal robe filling the temple, so that no human priest could minister there.\" But, as Mr. Cheyne observes, \"palace is more in harmony with the picture than temple.\" It is the heavenly palace of the King of kings into which the prophet's gaze is allowed to penetrate.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah6:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAbove it stood the seraphims: each one had six wings; with twain he covered his face, and with twain he covered his feet, and with twain he did fly.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 2. - Above it stood the seraphims; rather, above him were standing seraphim. The \"seraphim\" are introduced, not as well known, with the article, but without it, as unknown. The word means \"fiery ones,\" and is supposed to denote the burning love of the blessed spirits spoken cf. They appeared to the prophet as standing above the King as he sat upon his throne - \"standing\" to show their readiness to minister; but why \"above him\" is not so clear. Perhaps, simply, as those that stand are \"above\" those that sit; perhaps as ready to fly through infinite space at the bidding of him who was seated in his palace, as it were upon the ground. Their form, as seen by the prophet, appears to have been human, and only distinguished from ordinary humanity by the wings. Thus, though in name they resembled those other \"fiery ones,\" which had punished the Jews in the wilderness (Numbers 21:6-9), there is nothing to show that Isaiah in any way connected the two. Each one had six wings. Gesenius is mistaken in saying that there are at Persepolis any six-winged figures ('Thesaurus,' p. 1342). The Persians not infrequently represented their genii with four wings ('Ancient Monarchies,' vol. 3. pp. 353, 354); but no six-winged figures have been found, so far as I know, among the Persian remains. With twain he covered his face, etc. The general idea of the six wings was probably rapid flight, the carrying out of God's behests \"with speed swiftly.\" But, in the Divine presence, the wings were applied to a different use. One pair veiled the seraph's head from the intolerable effulgence of the Divine glory; another concealed the feet, soiled in their various ministrations, and unmeet for the all-pure presence; the third pair alone sustained the seraph in mid-air, as he hovered in readiness to depart on any errand on which Jehovah aright send him.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah6:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd one cried unto another, and said, Holy, holy, holy, is the LORD of hosts: the whole earth is full of his glory.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 3. - One cried; rather, kept crying (comp. Revelation 4:8, \"They rest not day and night, saying, Holy, holy, holy\"). But the prophet scarcely goes so far; he describes only his vision - they did not rest while the vision was vouchsafed him. Holy, holy, holy. The Church on earth has taken pattern by the Church above; and the \"Trisagion\" is ever being repeated in one part of the earth or another without ceasing: \"Thou continuest holy, O thou Worship of Israel.\" There is no attribute so essential to God as this. It is for his holiness, more than for anything else, that his creatures worship him. The triple repetition has been understood in all ages of the Church as connected with the doctrine of the Trinity. Holy is he who has created us, and bidden us worship him in the beauty of holiness Holy is he who has redeemed us, and washed away our sins, and made us by profession holy! Holy is he who day by day sanctifies us, and makes us in very deed and truth, so far as we will permit him, holy! The whole earth is full of his glory. Even in heaven the seraphic thoughts are turned to earth, and its relation to its Divine Creator is made the subject of angelic utterances (comp. 1 Corinthians 4:9; Hebrews 12:22). The lesson which they gather from their contemplation, even under all the miserable circumstances of the time, is a cheering one: \"The whole earth is full of God's glory.\" Men, whether they will it or not, are working out God's purposes, advancing his designs, accomplishing the ends that he desires (see Homiletics on Isaiah 5:25-29).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah6:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the posts of the door moved at the voice of him that cried, and the house was filled with smoke.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 4. - The posts of the door moved; rather, the bases of the thresholds shook (compare Revised Version). The shout of the seraphs shook the very foundations on which the thresholds of the gates of heaven rested - a testimony to the energy with which it was uttered. At the voice of him that cried; i.e. \"at the voice of each and all.\" The house was filled with smoke. \"Smoke\" is sometimes the mere sign of the presence of God, as in Isaiah 4:5; but more often it indicates his presence in anger or judgment (see Exodus 19:18; Exodus 20:18; Revelation 15:8). Here there had been no smoke at first, and we must suppose it, therefore, a sign of the anger which finds vent in ver. 9-12.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah6:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen said I, Woe is me! for I am undone; because I am a man of unclean lips, and I dwell in the midst of a people of unclean lips: for mine eyes have seen the King, the LORD of hosts.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 5-7. - THE SEQUEL OF THE VISION - THE PROPHET'S SENSE OF UNWORTHINESS. The vision of God in this life, whether natural or ecstatic, cannot but produce in the beholder a deep feeling of his unworthiness. God \"is of purer eyes than to behold iniquity;\" even \"the heavens are not clean in his sight\" (Job 15:15). Man, being never wholly purged from sin while on earth, cannot but shrink from contact with the absolutely Holy. Hence Isaiah's cry (ver. 5); and hence, to comfort him, the symbolic action of the seraph (ver. 6) and his encouraging words (ver. 7). Verse 5. - I am undone; literally, cut off, destroyed (comp. Isaiah 15:1; Jeremiah 47:5; Hosea 4:5, 6, etc.). God once said himself, \"There shall no man see me and live\" (Exodus 33:20). Men expected to die even when they had seen angels of God (Genesis 32:30; Judges 6:22, 23; Judges 13:22). How we are to reconcile Exodus 33:20 with this passage, Job 42:5, and Ezekiel 1:26-28, is uncertain. Perhaps the ecstatic sight was not included in the \"seeing\" of which God spoke to Moses. I am a man of unclean lips. A man must be indeed\" perfect\" never to offend in word (James 3:2). Isaiah felt that he had often so offended. His lips were not \"clean\" in God's sight, and if not his lips, then not his heart; for \"out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaketh\" (Matthew 12:34). I dwell in the midst of a people of unclean lips. Men catch up the phraseology of their time, and use wrong forms of speech, because they hear them daily. \"Evil communications corrupt good manners\" (1 Corinthians 15:33).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah6:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen flew one of the seraphims unto me, having a live coal in his hand, which he had taken with the tongs from off the altar:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 6. - A live coal; or, a glowing stone, as Gesenius, Rosenmüller, Knobel, and Mr. Cheyne understand (comp. 1 Kings 19:6, where a cognate word is used). The tongs... the altar. The presence of an altar in the heavenly dwelling, with the usual appurtenances, is assumed (comp. Revelation 6:9; Revelation 8:3). The altar is, no doubt, an altar of incense, and of gold, not of stone; but the incense is burnt upon stones heated to a glow, and it is one of these stones which the angel takes with the golden tongs of the sanctuary (Exodus 25:38).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah6:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he laid it upon my mouth, and said, Lo, this hath touched thy lips; and thine iniquity is taken away, and thy sin purged.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 7. - He laid it upon my mouth; literally, he caused it to touch my mouth; i.e. \"he touched my mouth with it.\" He brought it into contact with that part of him which the prophet had recognized (ver. 5) as the seat of impurity. Thine iniquity is taken away. By the contact the prophet's impurity is purged, and he is freed from it. The symbolical net showedNEWLINENEWLINE(1) that sin could be purged;NEWLINENEWLINE(2) that the highest angelic nature could not, alone and of its own force, purge it; andNEWLINENEWLINE(3) that the purging could come only from that fire which consumes the incense that is laid upon the altar of God. Dr. Kay suggests that this fire is \"the Divine love.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah6:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAlso I heard the voice of the Lord, saying, Whom shall I send, and who will go for us? Then said I, Here am I; send me.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 8-13. - THE PROPHET ENTRUSTED WITH A SPECIAL MISSON. We do not know what special call Isaiah had had previously. Perhaps he had been brought up in the \"schools of the prophets.\" Perhaps, when the \"word of the Lord\" came to him, he had accepted the fact as sufficient call. Now, however, he had, in vision, a clear and distinct call and mission (vers. 8, 9). He was told to \"go,\" and instructed as to what he was to say (vers. 9, 10). As before (Isaiah 1-5.), while in the main he was to denounce woe, he was still to proclaim the survival of a remnant (vers. 10-12). Verse 8. - Whom shall I send? (comp. 1 Kings 20:20). Such questions enable those who wait in the courts of heaven to show their zeal and readiness. Who will go for us? Some explain the plural pronoun as used of the Almighty and those with whom he is consulting. But he does not really \"consult\" his creatures (infra, Isaiah 40:14; Romans 11:34), nor do his messengers do his errands for them. The plural form is best explained by the light which ver. 3 throws on it, as indicative of the doctrine of the Trinity (comp. Genesis 1:26).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah6:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he said, Go, and tell this people, Hear ye indeed, but understand not; and see ye indeed, but perceive not.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 9. - Hear ye indeed... see ye indeed; literally, In hearing hear... in seeing see - with the force of \"Listen and bear; look and see;\" \"Attend, \"that is,\" with the outward souse, and catch all that sense can catch, but without perception of the inward meaning\" (see Matthew 13:14; Mark 4:12, etc.). This is what they would do. Isaiah is bidden to exhort them, in grave irony, to do it.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah6:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTMake the heart of this people fat, and make their ears heavy, and shut their eyes; lest they see with their eyes, and hear with their ears, and understand with their heart, and convert, and be healed.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 10. - Make the heart of this people fat. Isaiah is commanded to effect by his preaching that which his preaching would, in fact, effect. It would not awaken the people out of their apathy, it would not stir them to repentance; therefore it would only harden and deaden them. The words have a national, not an individual, application. Shut their eyes; literally, besmear their eyes; or, seal them up. Such sealing has been employed by Oriental monarchs as a punishment. And convert; i.e. \"turn to God.\" Our translators have used the word in an intransitive sense.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah6:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen said I, Lord, how long? And he answered, Until the cities be wasted without inhabitant, and the houses without man, and the land be utterly desolate,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 11. - Then said I, Lord, how long? Either, \"How long am I to continue this preaching?\" or, \"How long is this blindness and callousness of the people to continue?\" Isaiah assumes that he has not heard as yet God's final purpose; that there is some merciful intention kept in reserve, which is to take effect after the close of the period of judgment. The cities... the houses; rather, cities... houses. An entire desolation of the whole land, and extermination of its inhabitants, is not prophesied, and never took place. Nebuchadnezzar \"left of the poor of the land to be vinedressers and husbandmen\" (2 Kings 25:12; Jeremiah 39:10). Even when the great mass of these persons went into Egypt and perished there (Jeremiah 44:11-27), a certain number escaped and returned to Palestine (Jeremiah 44:14, 28). The land; rather, the ground, the soil.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah6:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the LORD have removed men far away, and there be a great forsaking in the midst of the land.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 12. - And the Lord have removed men far away. The Assyrian and Babylonian policy of deportation is pointed at. Pul had attacked the kingdom of Israel ten or twelve years before Uzziah's death, and had perhaps made the Assyrian policy known, though he had allowed himself to be bought off (2 Kings 15:19, 20). And there be a great forsaking; rather, and the desolation be great; i.e. till a great portion of Judah be depopulated.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah6:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut yet in it shall be a tenth, and it shall return, and shall be eaten: as a teil tree, and as an oak, whose substance is in them, when they cast their leaves: so the holy seed shall be the substance thereof.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 13. - But yet in it shall be a tenth, etc.; rather, and should there still be in it a tenth; i.e. should there still remain, after the great deportation, a tenth part of the inhabitants, \"this again shall be burned up,\" i.e. shall be destined to further judgment and destruction. The trials of the Jewish nation under the Persian, Egyptian, and Syrian monarchies may be intended. As a teil tree, and as an oak, etc.; rather, as the terebinth tree and as the oak - trees which shoot up again from the stock after being cut down; or, as the prophet expresses it, \"have a stem in their destruction.\" So to Judah shall remain, after all, a \"holy seed,\" which shall be its \"stem\" or \"stock, \"and from which it shall once more \"take root downward, and bear fruit upward\" (Isaiah 37:31).NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINE","Isa.7":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah7:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd it came to pass in the days of Ahaz the son of Jotham, the son of Uzziah, king of Judah, that Rezin the king of Syria, and Pekah the son of Remaliah, king of Israel, went up toward Jerusalem to war against it, but could not prevail against it.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 1-9. - THE PROPHECY GIVEN TO AHAZ AT THE TIME OF THE SYRO-ISRAELITISH WAR. The Syro-Israelitish war is touched on both in Kings and Chronicles. In Kings the alliance between Rezin and Pekah is distinctly declared, as also the fact that they conjointly besieged Jerusalem (2 Kings 16:5). From Chronicles we learn that, before the siege, Ahaz was twice defeated with great loss, once by the Syrians (2 Chronicles 28:5), and once by the Israelites (2 Chronicles 28:6). He was probably, therefore, reduced to great straits at the time when Isaiah received directions to seek an interview with him, and communicate to him a comforting message from Jehovah. Verse 1. - In the days of Ahaz. The reign of Ahaz covered, probably, the space between B.C. 743 and in B.C. 727. The march on Jerusalem appears to have fallen somewhat late in his reign (about B.C. 733). Rezin the King of Syria. Rezin is mentioned as King of Damascus by Tiglath-Pfieser II. in several of his inscriptions. In one, which seems to belong to B.C. 732 or 731, he states that he defeated Rezin and slew him. Pekah the son of Remaliah (see 2 Kings 15:25). Pekah had been an officer under Pekahiah, the son and successor of Menahem; but had revolted, put Pekahiah to death in his palace, and seized the crown. It is probable that he and Rezin were anxious to form a confederacy for the purpose of resisting the advance of the Assyrian power, and, distrusting Ahaz, desired to place on the throne of Judah a person on whom they could thoroughly depend (see ver. 6). It was not their design to conquer the Jewish kingdom, but only to change the sovereign. Toward Jerusalem; rather, to Jerusalem. The allies reached the city and commenced the siege (2 Kings 16:5). Could not prevail against it; literally, prevailed not in fighting against it.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah7:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd it was told the house of David, saying, Syria is confederate with Ephraim. And his heart was moved, and the heart of his people, as the trees of the wood are moved with the wind.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 2. - It was told the house of David. Before the actual siege began, news of the alliance reached Ahaz. It is said to have been\" told the house of David,\" because the design was to supersede the family of David by another - apparently a Syrian - house (see note on ver. 6). Syria is confederate with Ephraim; literally, rests upon Ephraim. Under ordinary circumstances the kingdoms of Syria and Israel were hostile the one to the other (see 1 Kings 15:20; 1 Kings 20:1-3; 1 Kings 22:3-36; 2 Kings 5:2; 2 Kings 6:8-24; 2 Kings 8:29; 2 Kings 10:32; 2 Kings 13:3, 22, 25). But occasionally, under the pressure of a great danger, the relations were changed, and a temporary league was formed. The inscriptions of Shalmaneser II. show such a league to have existed in the time of Benhadad II. and Ahab ('Ancient Monarchies,' vol. it. pp. 103, 104). The invasion of Pul, and the threatening attitude of Tiglath-Pileser. It had now once more drown the two countries together. On the use of the word \"Ephraim\" to designate the kingdom of Israel, see Hosea, passim. His heart was moved; or, shook. If the two kings had each been able separately to inflict on him such loss (see the introductory paragraph), what must he not expect, now that both were about to attack him together? It is not clear whether Ahuz had as yet applied to Assyria for help or not.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah7:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen said the LORD unto Isaiah, Go forth now to meet Ahaz, thou, and Shearjashub thy son, at the end of the conduit of the upper pool in the highway of the fuller's field;VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 3. - Thou, and Shear-Jashub thy son. The name Shear-Jashub, \"a remnant shall return,\" may have been given to Isaiah's son by revelation, as Ewald thinks it was; or Isaiah may have given it to testify his faith both in the threats and in the promises of which he had been made the mouth-piece. The command to take him with him on the present occasion was probably given on account of his name, that the attention of Ahaz might be called to it. The conduit of the upper pool is mentioned also in 2 Kings 18:17. It was probably a subterranean duct which brought water into the city from the high ground outside the Damascus gate. Ahaz may have visited it in order to see that it was made available for his own use, but not for the enemy's (comp. 2 Chronicles 32:3, 4, 30; Isaiah 22:9, 11).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah7:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd say unto him, Take heed, and be quiet; fear not, neither be fainthearted for the two tails of these smoking firebrands, for the fierce anger of Rezin with Syria, and of the son of Remaliah.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 4. - Take heed, and be quiet; or, see that thou keep quiet; i.e. \"be not disturbed; do not resort to strange and extreme measures; in quietness and confidence should be your strength\" (see Isaiah 30:15). The two tails of these smoking firebrands. Rezin and Pekah are called \"two tails,\" or \"two stumps of smoking firebrands,\" as persons who had been dangerous, but whose power of doing harm was on the polar of departing from them. They could not now kindle a flame; they could only \"smoke.\" The son of Remaliah. Pekah seems to be called \"Remaliah's son\" in contempt (comp. vers. 5, 9), Remaliah having been a man of no distinction (2 Kings 15:25).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah7:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBecause Syria, Ephraim, and the son of Remaliah, have taken evil counsel against thee, saying,VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah7:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTLet us go up against Judah, and vex it, and let us make a breach therein for us, and set a king in the midst of it, even the son of Tabeal:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 6. - Make a breach therein. The word employed means properly \"making a breach in a city wall\" (2 Kings 25:4; 2 Chronicles 32:1; Jeremiah 39:2; Ezekiel 26:10), but is used also in a metaphorical sense for injuring and ruining a country (see especially 2 Chronicles 21:17). The son of Tabeal; or, Tubal. \"Tab-ill\" appears to be a Syrian name, founded upon the same pattern as Tab-rimmon (1 Kings 15:18), rite one meaning \"God is good, \"the other \"Rimmon is good.\" We cannot, however, conclude from the name that the family of Tabeal was monotheistic (Kay), for El was one of the many Syrian gods as much as Rimmon (see Max Mailer, 'Science of Religion,' pp. 177, 178).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah7:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThus saith the Lord GOD, It shall not stand, neither shall it come to pass.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 7. - Thus saith the Lord God; literally, the Lord Jehovah, as in Isaiah 28:10; Isaiah 40:10; Isaiah 48:16, etc. It shall not stand; i.e. \"the design shall not hold good, it shall not be accomplished.\" Rezin and Pekah have planned to set aside the issue of David, to which God had promised his throne (2 Samuel 7:11-16; Psalm 89:27-37), and to act up a new line of kings unconnected with David. They think to frustrate the everlasting counsel of God. Such an attempt was of necessity futile.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah7:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor the head of Syria is Damascus, and the head of Damascus is Rezin; and within threescore and five years shall Ephraim be broken, that it be not a people.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 8. - For the head of Syria is Damascus, etc. Syria and Ephraim have merely human heads - the one Rezin, the other (ver. 9) Pekah; but Judah, it is implied, has a Divine Head, even Jehovah. How, then, should mere mortals think to oppose their will and their designs to God's? Of course, their designs must come to naught. Within threescore and five years shall Ephraim be broken, etc. If this prophecy was delivered, as we have supposed, in B.C. 733 (see note on ver. 1), sixty-five years later would bring us to B.C. 669. This was the year in which Esar-haddon, having made his son, Asshur-bani-pal, King of Assyria, transferred his own residence to Babylon, and probably the year in which he sent from Babylonia and the adjacent countries a number of colonists who occupied Samaria, and entirely destroyed the nationality, which, fifty-three years earlier, had received a rude blow from Sargon (comp. Ezra 4:2, 9, 10, with 2 Kings 17:6-24 and 2 Chronicles 33:11). It is questioned whether, under the circumstances, the prophet can have comforted Ahaz with this distant prospect, and suggested that in the present chapter prophecies pronounced at widely distant periods have been mixed up (Cheyne); but there is no such appearance of dislocation in Isaiah 7, in its present form, as necessitates any such theory; and, while it may be granted that the comfort of the promise given in ver. 8 would be slight, it cannot be said that it would be nil; it may, therefore, have been (as it seems to us) without impropriety added to the main promise, which is that of ver. 7. The entire clause, from \"and within\" to \"not a people,\" must be regarded as parenthetic.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah7:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the head of Ephraim is Samaria, and the head of Samaria is Remaliah's son. If ye will not believe, surely ye shall not be established.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 9. - If ye will not believe, etc. Translate, If ye will not hold this faith fast, surely ye will not stand fast. Full faith in the promise of ver. 7 would have enabled Ahaz to dispense with all plans of earthly policy, and to \"stand fast in the Lord,\" without calling in the aid of any \"arm of flesh.\" Distrust of the promise would lead him to take steps which would not tend to \"establish\" him, but would make his position more insecure (see 2 Kings 16:7-18; 2 Chronicles 28:16, 20).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah7:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTMoreover the LORD spake again unto Ahaz, saying,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 10-16. - THE SIGN OF IMMANUEL. The supposition that there was a considerable interval between ver. 9 and ver. 10 (Cheyne) is quite gratuitous. Nothing in the text marks any such interval. God had sent Ahaz one message by his prophet (vers. 4-9). It had apparently been received in silence, at any rate without acknowledgment. The faith had seemed to be lacking which should have embraced with gladness the promise given (see the last clause of ver. 9). God, however, will give the unhappy monarch another chance. And so he scuds him a second message, the offer of a sign which should make belief in the first message easier to him (ver. 11). Ahaz proudly rejects this offer (ver. 12). Then the sign of \"Immanuel\" is given - not to Ahaz individually, but to the whole \"house of David,\" and through them to the entire Jewish people. \"A virgin shall conceive, and bear a son, whose name shall be called Immanuel; and before this child shall have grown to the age of moral discernment, God's people will have been delivered, and their enemies made a desolation\" (vers. 14-16). The exact bearing of the \"sign\" will be best discussed in the comment upon ver. 14. Verse 10. - The Lord spake again unto Ahaz. As before (vers. 3, 4) by the mouth of his prophet.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah7:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAsk thee a sign of the LORD thy God; ask it either in the depth, or in the height above.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 11. - Ask thee a sign. Asking for a sign is right or wrong, praiseworthy or blamable, according to the spirit in which the request is made. The Pharisees in our Lord's time \"asked for a sign,\" but would not have believed any the more had they received the sign for which they asked. Gideon asked for a sign to strengthen his faith (Judges 6:37, 39), and received it, and in the strength of it went forth boldly against the Midianites. When God himself proposed to give a sign, and allowed his creature to choose what the sign should be, there could be no possible wrong-doing in a ready acceptance of the offer, which should have called forth gratitude and thanks. Ask it either in the depth, or in the height above; i.e. \"Ask any sign thou wilt, either in hell or in heaven\" - nothing shall be refused thee.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah7:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut Ahaz said, I will not ask, neither will I tempt the LORD.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 12. - I will not ask, neither will I tempt the Lord. Ahaz, who has no wish for a sign, because he has no wish to believe in any other salvation than flint which will follow from the realization of his own schemes, finds a plausible reason for declining to ask for one in those passages of the Law which forbade men to\" tempt God\" (Exodus 17:7; Deuteronomy 6:16). But it could not be \"tempt-tug God\" to comply with a Divine invitation; rather it was tempting him to refuse compliance.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah7:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he said, Hear ye now, O house of David; Is it a small thing for you to weary men, but will ye weary my God also?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 13. - O house of David (comp. ver. 2). It is not Ahaz alone, but the \"house of David,\" which is on its trial. Men are conspiring to remove it (ver. 6). If it will not be saved in God's way, it will have to be removed by God himself. Is it a small thing for you to weary men? i.e. \"Are you not content with wearying men; with disregarding all my warnings and so wearying me? Must you go further, and weary God\" (or, \"wear out his patience\") \"by rejecting his gracious offers?\" My God. In ver. 11 Isaiah had called Jehovah \"thy God;\" but as Ahaz, by rejecting God's offer, had rejected God, he speaks of him now as \"my God.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah7:14VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTTherefore the Lord himself shall give you a sign; Behold, a virgin shall conceive, and bear a son, and shall call his name Immanuel.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 14. - Therefore. To show that your perversity cannot change God's designs, which will be accomplished, whether you hear or whether you forbear. The Lord himself; i.e. \"the Lord himself, of his own free will, unasked.\" Will give you a sign. \"Signs\" were of various kinds. They might be actual miracles performed to attest a Divine commission (Exodus 4:3-9); or judgments of God, significative of his power and justice (Exodus 10:2); or memorials of something in the past (Exodus 13:9, 16); or pledges of something still future. Signs of this last-mentioned kind might be miracles (Judges 6:36-40; 2 Kings 20:8-11), or prophetic announcements (Exodus 3:12; 1 Samuel 2:34; 2 Kings 19:29). These last would only have the effect of signs on those who witnessed their accomplishment. Behold. \"A forewarning of a great event\" (Cheyne). A virgin shall conceive. It is questioned whether the word translated \"virgin,\" viz. 'almah, has necessarily that meaning; but it is admitted that the meaning is borne out by every other place in which the word occurs m the Old Testament (Genesis 24:43; Exodus 2:8; Psalm 68:25; Proverbs 30:19; Song of Solomon 1:3; Song of Solomon 6:8). The LXX., writing two centuries before the birth of Christ, translate by παρθένος. The rendering \"virgin\" has the support of the best modern Hebraists, as Lowth, Gesenins, Ewald, Delitzsch, Kay. It is observed with reason that unless 'almah is translated \"virgin,\" there is no announcement made worthy of the grand prelude: \"The Lord himself shall give you a sign - Behold!\" The Hebrew, however, has not \"a virgin,\" but \"the virgin\" (and so the Septuagint, ἡ παρθένος), which points to some special virgin, pro-eminent above all others. And shall call; better than the marginal rendering, thou shalt call. It was regarded as the privilege of a mother to determine her child's name (Genesis 4:25; Genesis 16:11; Genesis 29:32-35; Genesis 30:6-13, 18-21, 24; Genesis 35:18, etc.), although formally the father gave it (Genesis 16:15; 2 Samuel 12:24; Luke 1:62, 83). Immanuel. Translated for us by St. Matthew (Matthew 1:23) as \"God with us\" (μεθ ἡμῶν ὁ Θεός). (Comp. Isaiah 8:8, 10.)NEWLINENEWLINEIsaiah 7:15 Verse 15. - Butter and honey shall he eat. His fare shall be of the simplest kind (comp. ver. 22). That he may know; rather, till he shall know (Rosenmüller); i.e. till he come to years of discretion. (The rendering of the Revisers of 1885, \"when he knoweth,\" is less satisfactory.)NEWLINENEWLINE- Note on the general purport of the Immanuel prophecy. Few prophecies have been the subject of so much controversy, or called forth such a variety of exegesis, as this prophecy of Immanuel. Rosenmüller gives a list of twenty-eight authors who have written dissertations upon it, and himself adds a twenty-ninth. Yet the subject is far from being exhausted. It is still asked:NEWLINENEWLINE(1) Were the mother and son persons belonging to the time of Isaiah himself, and if so, what persons? Or,NEWLINENEWLINE(2) Were they the Virgin Mary and her Son Jesus? Or,NEWLINENEWLINE(3) Had the prophecy a double fulfillment, first in certain persons who lived in Isaiah's time, and secondly in Jesus and his mother?NEWLINENEWLINEI. The first theory is that of the Jewish commentators. Originally, they suggested that the mother was Abi, the wife of Ahaz (2 Kings 18:2), and the son Hezekiah, who delivered Judah from the Assyrian power (see Justin, 'Dial. cum Tryphon.,' p. 262). But this was early disproved by showing that, according to the numbers of Kings (2 Kings 16:2; 2 Kings 18:2), Hezekiah was at least nine years old in the first year of Ahaz, before which this prophecy could not have been delivered (Isaiah 7:1). The second suggestion made identified the mother with Isaiah's wife, the \"prophetess\" of Isaiah 8:3, and made the son a child of his, called actually Immanuel, or else his son Maher-shalal-hash-baz (Isaiah 8:1) under a symbolical designation. But ha-'almah, \"the virgin,\" would be a very strange title for Isaiah to have given his wife, and the rank assigned to Immanuel in Isaiah 8:8 would not suit any son of Isaiah's. It remains to regard the 'almah as \"some young woman actually present,\" name, rank, and position unknown, and Immanuel as her son, also otherwise unknown (Cheyne). But the grand exordium, \"The Lord himself shall give you a sign - Behold!\" and the rank of Immanuel (Isaiah 8:8), are alike against this.NEWLINENEWLINEII. The purely Messianic theory is maintained by Rosenmüller and Dr. Kay, but without any consideration of its difficulties. The birth of Christ was an event more than seven hundred years distant. In what sense and to what persons could it be a \"sign\" of the coming deliverance of the land from Rezin and Pekah? And, upon the purely Messianic theory, what is the meaning of ver. 16? Syria and Samaria were, in fact, crushed within a few years of the delivery of the prophecy. Why is their desolation put off, apparently, till the coming of the Messiah, and even till he has reached a certain age? Mr. Cheyne meets these difficulties by the startling statement that Isaiah expected the advent of the Messiah to synchronize with the Assyrian invasion, and consequently thought that before Rezin and Pekah were crushed he would have reached the age of discernment. But he does not seem to see that in this case the sigma was altogether disappointing and illusory. Time is an essential element of a prophecy which turns upon the word \"before\" (ver. 16). If this faith of Isaiah's disciples was aroused and their hopes raised by the announcement that Immanuel was just about to be born (Mr. Cheyne translates, \"A virgin is with child\"), what would be the revulsion of feeling when no Immanuel appeared?NEWLINENEWLINEIII. May not the true account of the matter be that suggested by Bishop Lowth - that the prophecy had a double bearing and a double fulfillment? \"The obvious and literal meaning of the prophecy is this,\" he says: \"that within the time that a young woman, now a virgin, should conceive and bring forth a child, and that child should arrive at such an age as to distinguish between good and evil, that is, within a few years, the enemies of Judah should be destroyed.\" But the prophecy was so worded, he adds, as to have a further meaning, which wan even \"the original design and principal intention of the prophet,\" viz. the Messianic one. All the expressions of the prophecy do not suit both its intentions - some are selected with reference to the first, others with reference to the second fulfillment - but all suit one or the other, and some suit both. The first child may have received the name Immanuel (comp. Ittiel) from a faithful Jewish mother, who believed that God was with his people, whatever dangers threatened, and may have reached years of discretion about the time that Samaria was carried away captive. The second child is the true \"Immanuel,\" \"God with us,\" the king of Isaiah 8:8; it is his mother who is pointed at in the expression, \"the virgin,\" and on his account is the grand preamble; through him the people of God, the true Israel, is delivered from its spiritual enemies, sin and Satan - two kings who continually threaten it.NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah7:15VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTButter and honey shall he eat, that he may know to refuse the evil, and choose the good.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah7:16VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor before the child shall know to refuse the evil, and choose the good, the land that thou abhorrest shall be forsaken of both her kings.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 16. - The land, etc. Translate, The land shall be desolate, before whose two kings thou art afraid. The \"land\" must certainly be that of the two confederate kings, Rezin and Pekah, the Syro-Ephraim-itic land, or Syria and Samaria. \"Desolate\" may be used physically or politically. A land is \"desolate\" politically when it loses the last vestige of independence.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah7:17VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe LORD shall bring upon thee, and upon thy people, and upon thy father's house, days that have not come, from the day that Ephraim departed from Judah; even the king of Assyria.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 17-25. - THE DANGER TO JUDAH FROM ASSYRIA. The perversity of Ahaz, already rebuked in ver. 13, is further punished by a threat, that upon him, and upon his people, and upon his father's house, shall come shortly a dire calamity. The very power whose aid he is himself bent on invoking shall be the scourge to chastise both king and people (vers. 17-20). The land shall be made bare as by a razor (ver. 20). Cultivation shall cease; its scant inhabitants will support themselves by keeping a few cows and sheep (ver. 21), and will nourish themselves on dairy produce, and the honey that the wild bees produce (ver. 22). Briers and thorns will come up everywhere; wild beasts will increase; cattle will browse on the hills that were once carefully cultivated to their summits (vers. 23-25). Verse 17. - The Lord shall bring upon thee, etc. The transition from promises to threatenings is abrupt, and calculated to impress any one who was to any extent impressible. But Ahaz seems not to have had \"ears to hear.\" From the day that Ephraim departed from Judah; i.e. from the time of the revolt under Jeroboam (1 Kings 12:16-24) - an evil day, which rankled in the mind of all true Judaeans. Even the King of Assyria. The construction is awkward, since \"the King of Assyria' cannot well stand in apposition with \"days.\" Hence many take the words for a gloss that has been accidentally intruded into the text (Lowth, Gesenius, Hitzig, Knobel, Cheyne). Others, however, see in the grammatical anomaly a grace of composition.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah7:18VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd it shall come to pass in that day, that the LORD shall hiss for the fly that is in the uttermost part of the rivers of Egypt, and for the bee that is in the land of Assyria.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 18. - The Lord shall hiss (see Isaiah 5:26, and note ad loc.). For the fly that is in the uttermost part of the rivers of Egypt. The \"fly of Egypt,\" like the \"bee of Assyria,\" represents the military force of the nation, which God summons to take part in the coming affliction of Judaea. The prophetic glance may be extended over the entire period of Judah's decadence, and the \"flies\" summoned may include those which clustered about Neco at Megiddo, and carried off Jehoahaz from Jerusalem (2 Kings 23:29-34). There may be allusion also to Egyptian ravages in the reigns of Sargon, Sennacherib, and Esar-haddon. In any general review of the period we shall find it stated that, from the time of Sargon to that of Cyrus, Judaea was the battle-ground upon which the forces of Assyria (or Assyro-Babylonia) and Egypt contended for the empire of western Asia. The desolation of the land during this period was produced almost as much by the Egyptian \"fly as by the Assyrian bee.\" The \"rivers of Egypt\" are the Nile, its branches, and perhaps the great canals by which its waters were distributed. The bee that is in the land of Assyria. The choice of the terms \"bee\" and \"fly,\" to represent respectively the hosts of Assyria and Egypt, is not without significance. Egyptian armies were swarms, hastily levied, and very imperfectly disciplined. Assyrian were bodies of trained troops accustomed to war, and almost as well disciplined as the Romans.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah7:19VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd they shall come, and shall rest all of them in the desolate valleys, and in the holes of the rocks, and upon all thorns, and upon all bushes.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 19. - And rest; or, settle. In the desolate valleys. Gesenius and Vance Smith translate \"the precipitous valleys;\" Mr. Cheyne, \"the steeply walled valleys.\" But the cognate word used in Isaiah 5:6 can only mean \"waste,\" which supports the rendering of the Authorized Version. The exact word used does not occur elsewhere. Upon all bushes; rather, upon all pastures.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah7:20VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTIn the same day shall the Lord shave with a rasor that is hired, namely, by them beyond the river, by the king of Assyria, the head, and the hair of the feet: and it shall also consume the beard.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 20. - Shall the Lord shave with a razor that is hired; rather, with the hired razor; i.e. the razor that Ahaz will have hired (2 Kings 16:8). The metaphor well expresses the stripping of the land bare by plunder and exaction (comp. Ezekiel 5:1, 12, and 2 Chronicles 28:19-21). God would use Tiglath-Pileser as his instrument to distress Ahaz. By them beyond the river; or, in the parts beyond the river (comp. 1 Chronicles 19:16). \"The river\" is undoubtedly the Euphrates, and they who dwell beyond it the Assyrians. By the King of Assyria. Once more a gloss is suspected, as in ver. 17. The meaning would certainly be sufficiently plain without the clause. The head... the hair of the feet... the beard. These three represent all the hair on any part of the body. Judah is to be completely stripped.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah7:21VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd it shall come to pass in that day, that a man shall nourish a young cow, and two sheep;VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 21. - A man shall nourish a young cow, and two sheep; literally, two ewes. A stop having been put to cultivation, men shall return to the pastoral life, but shall not possess more than two or three head of cattle apiece, the Assyrians having swept off most of the beasts. Tiglath-Pileser, in his inscriptions, mentions his carrying off homed cattle and sheep to the amount of many thousands from the countries which he overran or conquered ('Records of the Past,' vol. 5. pp. 49, 52).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah7:22VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd it shall come to pass, for the abundance of milk that they shall give he shall eat butter: for butter and honey shall every one eat that is left in the land.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 22. - For the abundance of milk that they shall give. The small number of the cattle will allow of each having abundant pasture. Hence they will give an abundance of milk. He shall eat butter; rather, curds - the solid food most readily obtained from milk (comp. above, ver. 15). Curdled milk and wild honey should form the simple diet of the remnant left in the land. It is, of course, possible to understand this in a spiritual sense, of simple doctrine and gospel honey out of the flinty rock of the Law; but there is no reason to think that the prophet intended his words in any but the most literal sense.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah7:23VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd it shall come to pass in that day, that every place shall be, where there were a thousand vines at a thousand silverlings, it shall even be for briers and thorns.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 23. - A thousand vines at a thousand silverlings. By \"silverlings\" our translators mean \"pieces of silver,\" probably shekels. \"A thousand vines at a thousand shekels\" may mean either a thousand vines worth that amount, or a thousand vines rented at that sum annually (comp. Song of Solomon 8:11). The latter would point to vineyards of unusual goodness, since the shekel is at least eighteen pence, and the present rent of a vineyard in Palestine is at the rate of a piastre for each vine, or 2½d. The general meaning would seem to be that not even the best vineyards would be cultivated, but would lie waste, and grow only \"briers and thorns.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah7:24VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWith arrows and with bows shall men come thither; because all the land shall become briers and thorns.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 24. - With arrows and with bows. Only the hunter will go there, armed with his weapons of chase, to kill the wild animals that will haunt the thickets.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah7:25VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd on all hills that shall be digged with the mattock, there shall not come thither the fear of briers and thorns: but it shall be for the sending forth of oxen, and for the treading of lesser cattle.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 25. - On all hills that shall be digged; rather, that shall have been digged in former times, whether for corn cultivation or for any other. There shall not come thither the fear of briers (so Ewald and Kay). But almost all other commentators translate, \"Thou shalt not come thither for fear of briers,\" etc. The briers and thorns of the East tear the clothes and the flesh. It shall be; i.e. \"each such place shall be.\" For the sending forth of oxen; rather, for the sending in of oxen. Men shall send their cattle into them, as alone able to penetrate the jungle without hurt. SUPPLEMENTARY NOTE.NEWLINE","Isa.8":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah8:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTMoreover the LORD said unto me, Take thee a great roll, and write in it with a man's pen concerning Mahershalalhashbaz.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 1-4. - THE SIGN OF MAHER-SHALAL-HASH-BAZ. The sign of Immanuel was recondite. In its more spiritual sense it appealed to faith in an event far distant. Even in its literal import, it was not calculated to cheer and encourage more than a few, since neither the maiden nor the child was pointed out with any distinctness. A fresh sign was therefore given by God's goodness to reassure the mass of the people - a sign about which there was nothing obscure or difficult. Isaiah himself should have a son born to him almost immediately, to whom he should give a name indicating the rapid approach of the spoiler, and before this child should be able to utter the first words which childhood ordinarily pronounces, \"Father,\" \"Mother,\" Damascus and Samaria should be despoiled. Verse 1. - Take thee a great roll; rather, a large tablet. The word is the same as that used for \"mirror\" in Isaiah 3:23. Write in it with a man's pen; i.e. \"write upon it with the pen used by ordinary men\" - in opposition to the implements of an engraver. The tablet was probably to be hung up to view in a public place (comp. Isaiah 30:8), so that all might read, and the writing was therefore to be such as was in ordinary use. Concerning Maher-shalal-hash-baz. These were the words which were to be written on the tablet, which was to be otherwise left blank. They would naturally excite curiosity, like the strange names placarded in modern streets. The name is literally, \"Plunder speeds, spoil hastens.\" It has been imitated by Goethe in his \"Habebald-Eilebeute\" ('Faust,' act 4. sc. 3).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah8:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd I took unto me faithful witnesses to record, Uriah the priest, and Zechariah the son of Jeberechiah.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 2. - And I took unto me; rather, and I will have taken for me. It is still God who is speaking. Uriah the priest. Probably the high priest of the time, mentioned in 2 Kings 16:10-16, as the ready tool of Ahaz at a later date. Though a bad man, he may have been a trustworthy witness to a fact. Zechariah. Perhaps the father of Abi or Abijah, Ahaz's queen (2 Kings 18:2; 2 Chronicles 29:1). It would serve to call public attention still more to the tablet, if it bore the names of two such eminent persons as witnesses.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah8:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd I went unto the prophetess; and she conceived, and bare a son. Then said the LORD to me, Call his name Mahershalalhashbaz.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 3. - The prophetess. It is not necessary to suppose that the wife of Isaiah must have uttered prophecies because she is called \"the prophetess.\" Titles were given in the East to the wives, daughters, etc., of officials, which merely reflected the dignity of their husbands, fathers, etc. Even Miriam seems to be called a \"prophetess\" (Exodus 15:20) from her close relationship to Moses, rather than from any supernatural power that she had. In the Mishna, a priest's wife or daughter is called \"priestess\" (Cheyne). Call his name. There is no reason for doubting that the name was actually given. Other Israelites had such names as Jushab-hosed (1 Chronicles 3:20), Haah-ashtari (1 Chronicles 4:6), Romamti-ezer (1 Chronicles 25:4), Machnadebai (Ezra 10:40), and the like. Assyrian names were even longer; e.g., As-shur-bel-nisi-su, Asshur-kinat-ili-kain, etc. In ordinary parlance, names of this type were commonly shortened, \"Shalman-eser' becoming \"Shalmau\" (Hosea 10:14), \"Sennacherib Jareb\" (Hosea 10:6), and the like.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah8:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor before the child shall have knowledge to cry, My father, and my mother, the riches of Damascus and the spoil of Samaria shall be taken away before the king of Assyria.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 4. - My father... my mother. \"Abi,\" \"Immi,\" would have been among the first utterances of childhood - simple sounds, combinations of primary vowels with labials, corresponding in easiness of utterance to \"Pappy,\" \"Mammy,\" rather than to the expressions of the text. A child commonly utters such sounds when it is about a year old. The riches of Damascus. The position of Damascus lay in the direct path of the main trade that was carried on between the West and East, which was conducted by the merchants of Tyro chiefly, and passed from the Syrian coast by way of Damascus and Tadmor to Nineveh and Babylon. This commerce greatly enriched the cities lying upon its route. \"Damascus,\" says Ezekiel, addressing Tyre, \"was thy merchant in the multitude of the wares of thy making, for the multitude of all riches; in the wine of Helbon, and white wool\" (Ezekiel 27:18). The \"palaces of Benhadad\" seem to have been noted for their magnificence (Jeremiah 49:27; Amos 1:4). The spoil of Samaria shall be taken away before the King of Assyria. Scripture does not record the fulfillment of this prophecy, which makes the same Assyrian king carry off the spoil of Samaria and the spoil of Damascus, fixing also the time of the carrying off as within a few years of the time when the prophecy was given. But the inscriptions of Tiglath-Pileser himself supply the deficiency. They state that this monarch \"sent the population, the goods of the people of Beth-Omri, and their furniture to the land of Assyria;\" after which he \"appointed Husih (Hoshea) to the dominion ever them,\" and fixed their annual tribute at two talents of gold and a thousand talents of silver (see 'Records of the Past,' vol. 5. p. 52).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah8:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe LORD spake also unto me again, saying,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 5-10. - THE FLOOD OF ASSYRIAN INVASION WILL PASS FROM SYRIA AND SAMARIA INTO JUDAEA, BUT WILL THERE BE ARRESTED. Syria and Samaria were barriers, breakwaters, so placed as to stem the tide of invasion, and be a defense to Judaea against Assyrian attack. When once they were overwhelmed, the waters would have free course, and the submersion of Judaea was certain. It might be delayed by the Divine favor, and would be, so long as the people, or even a remnant of them, remained faithful, but only through the might of the name Immanuel, \"God with us.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah8:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTForasmuch as this people refuseth the waters of Shiloah that go softly, and rejoice in Rezin and Remaliah's son;VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 6. - Forasmuch as this people. It is a question which people is intended, Judah or Israel. Ewald supposes Judah, and draws the conclusion that there was a strong party in Jerusalem which favored \"the son of Tabeal.\" Dr. Kay does the same, but understands the charge against Judah to be, not that it sympathized with Rezin, but that it fell into the same sins. Other commentators suggest that Israel is the people intended (as in Isaiah 9:16), the sense being carried on from ver. 4, where the word \"Samaria\" is suggestive of the Israelite people. Refuseth the waters of Shiloah. The \"pool of Siloah\" (Nehemiah 3:15) was the tank or reservoir at the southwestern foot of Ophel, which is supplied with water by a narrow conduit cut through the limestone rock for a distance of 1750 feet from the \"Pool of the Virgin\" on the opposite side of Ophel, in the Kedron valley. This pool itself is fed from reservoirs under the temple area, which have not yet been fully explored. It is probable that Isaiah uses the expression \"waters of Shiloah\" in a general sense for the streams, springs, reservoirs, conduits, which supplied the temple, and were connected with its service. \"Refusing the waters of Shiloah\" would then be, without any violent metaphor, refusing the temple service and worship, which was exactly what the Israelites had done from the time of Jeroboam. That go softly. In contrast with the \"waters of the river, strong and many,\" of the next verse. They who refused the mild and gentle government of Jehovah should experience the impetuous and torrent-like rush of the Assyrian armies. Rejoice in Rezin; rather, rejoice with Rezin; i.e. sympathize with him, rejoice when he rejoices.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah8:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTNow therefore, behold, the Lord bringeth up upon them the waters of the river, strong and many, even the king of Assyria, and all his glory: and he shall come up over all his channels, and go over all his banks:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 7. - The waters of the river, strong and many. \"The river\" is, of course, the Euphrates, as in Isaiah 7:20. In its lower course the Euphrates often overflows its banks, and inundates the adjacent districts, causing vast damage to crops, and some-limes threatening to break down the walls of cities (Loftus, 'Chaldea and Susiana,' p. 7). It is scarcely likely, however, that Isaiah had any acquaintance with this fact. His experience would probably have been limited to the \"swellings of Jordan\" (Jeremiah 12:5; comp. Joshua 3:15). All his glory (comp. Isaiah 10:12, 16, 18, etc.). He shall come up over all his channels. A graphic description of the swelling of rivers in the East. These, when they are low, contract their waters from the many channels, in which they ordinarily flow, into some one or two, leaving the others dry. The first effect of a flood is to fill all the channels, after which it may proceed further and overflow the banks.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah8:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he shall pass through Judah; he shall overflow and go over, he shall reach even to the neck; and the stretching out of his wings shall fill the breadth of thy land, O Immanuel.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 8. - And he shall pass through Judah; rather, he shall pass on into Judah (\"He shall sweep onward into Judah,\" Revised Version). The Assyrians will not be content with invading Syria and Samaria; they will \"pass on into Judaea.\" It is not clear whether this is to be done immediately by Tiglath-Pileser, or by one of his successors at a later date. There is reason to believe from Tiglath-Pileser's inscriptions that he used the territory of Ahaz for the passage of his armies as those of a vassal king, but did not ravage them. He shall reach even to the neck. The Assyrian attacks on Judaea shall stop short of destroying it. The flood shall not submerge the head, but only rise as high as the neck. This prophecy was fulfilled, since it was not Assyria, but Babylon, which destroyed the Jewish kingdom. The stretching out of his wings shall fill the breadth of thy land. The Assyrian armies shall visit every part of the land. The sudden change of metaphor is in the manner of Isaiah (see Isaiah 1:30, 31; Isaiah 5:24, 30, etc.). O Immanuel. On the importance of this address, as indicating the kingly, and so (probably) the Divine character of Immanuel, see the notes on Isaiah 7:14. Isaiah could not speak of the land as belonging to his own infant son.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah8:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAssociate yourselves, O ye people, and ye shall be broken in pieces; and give ear, all ye of far countries: gird yourselves, and ye shall be broken in pieces; gird yourselves, and ye shall be broken in pieces.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 9. - Associate yourselves. It is impossible to obtain this meaning from the existing Hebrew text, which must be translated, \"Be ahoy,\" or \"Rage\" (\"Make an uproar,\" Revised Version). The prophet passes from the consideration of the opposition offered to Jehovah by Israel, Syria, and Assyria, to a general consideration of all the nations of the earth. He challenges them to the combat against Jehovah, and confidently predicts their defeat. O ye people; rather, O ye peoples (compare the corresponding expression in the next clause, \"All ye of far countries\").NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah8:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTTake counsel together, and it shall come to nought; speak the word, and it shall not stand: for God is with us.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 10. - Take counsel together; literally, devise a device; i.e. form some plan, even the cleverest possible, against God's people, and the result will be utter failure. It shall not stand (comp. Isaiah 7:7). For God is with us. In the Hebrew, ki 'immanu-El, \"for with us (is) God\" words declarative of the true meaning of the name which God had made a sign to his people (Isaiah 7:14). It was his being \"with them\" that could alone save them from their enemies.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah8:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor the LORD spake thus to me with a strong hand, and instructed me that I should not walk in the way of this people, saying,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 11-16. - THE GROUNDS OF ISAIAH'S CONFIDENCE. Having declared his absolute confidence, not only that the attack of Pekah and Rezin will fail (vers. 1-4), but that Assyria also (ver. 8), nay, that all the nations of the earth (ver. 9) will fail, and bring destruction upon themselves, if they \"devise devices\" against God's true people, the prophet explains the ground of his confidence by relating a special \"instruction\" which he had received from God some time previously, he had been bidden to separate himself from the mass of his countrymen in thought and feeling, and to cling only to Jehovah, who would \"be for a Sanctuary\" (ver. 14) to his own, but \"for a Stone of stumbling and a Rock of offence\" to all others. Verse 11. - For the Lord. Mr. Cheyne regards this passage as \"a short oracle, complete in itself,\" and entirely unconnected with what has preceded. But the initial ki, \"for,\" is in that case inexplicable. Spake thus to me with a strong hand; literally, with strength of hand - i.e. laying a strong grasp upon him; and, as it were, constraining him to attend (comp. Ezekiel 1:3; Ezekiel 3:14, 22, etc.). That I should not walk in the way of this people. Isaiah was bidden not to \"follow a multitude to evil\" (Exodus 23:2). It was not merely idolatry against which he was warned, but the whole spirit and tone of the society of his day. He was not to entertain their suspicions, or to hope their hopes, or to fear their fears. He was to take a line of his own, to fear God and him only; then God would be \"for a Sanctuary\" to him.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah8:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTSay ye not, A confederacy, to all them to whom this people shall say, A confederacy; neither fear ye their fear, nor be afraid.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 12. - Say ye not. The transition from the singular to the plural is noticeable. It implies that Isaiah did not stand alone, but had followers - a \"little flock,\" it may be - but still enough to give him the support of sympathy (comp. ver. 16). A confederacy; rather, treason, or conspiracy (see 2 Samuel 15:12; 1 Kings 16:20; 2 Kings 11:12; 2 Kings 12:20; Jeremiah 11:9; Ezekiel 22:25, etc.). The command is, not to call a course of conduct treasonable simply because the people generally so call it. Jeremiah was charged with treason for preaching the hopelessness of offering resistance to Nebuchadnezzar (Jeremiah 20:1; Jeremiah 26:8-11). Those who opposed an Assyrian alliance were probably now taxed with treason. To all them to whom; rather, everything which. Translate the entire clause thus: Call ye not conspiracy everything which this people shall call conspiracy. Neither fear ye their fear. They feared man (Isaiah 7:2).

Ezekiel 11:16, \"Yet will I be to them as a little Sanctuary\"). A sanctuary is \"a refuge\" (Psalm 90:1; Psalm 91:9), and something more. It is a holy refuge, a place which is a refuge because of its holiness. Its material counterpart in the Mosaic system is, not \"the city of refuge,\" but the altar (1 Kings 1:50; 1 Kings 2:28). Both the houses of Israel; i.e. \"the two reigning houses of Samaria and Judaea,\" both of which were Israelite. Both the \"houses\" would ultimately forsake Jehovah, and find in him a \"Snare\" and a \"Rock of offense.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah8:15VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd many among them shall stumble, and fall, and be broken, and be snared, and be taken.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 15. - Many among them (so the Vulgate, Ewald, Delitzsch, and Knobel).

The effect of stumbling against a stone (Matthew 21:44; Luke 20:18). Be snared, and be taken. The effect of being caught in a gin (Psalm 9:15, 16).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah8:16VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBind up the testimony, seal the law among my disciples.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 16. - Bind up the testimony, etc. The words are still those of Jehovah, addressed to his servant Isaiah. God commands that the prophecy shall be written in a roll, which is then to be carefully tied with a string and sealed, for future use. Seal the Law; rather, the instruction - the advice given in vers. 12-15 (comp. Daniel 12:4).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah8:17VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd I will wait upon the LORD, that hideth his face from the house of Jacob, and I will look for him.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 17, 18. - ISAIAH DEFINES HIS OWN ATTITUDE AND THAT OF HIS CHILDREN. It is questioned whether something has not fallen out between vers. 16 and 17. The transition is exceedingly abrupt, undoubtedly; but perhaps not more abrupt than elsewhere in Isaiah and the prophets contemporary with him. The Divine \"instruction\" comes to an end in ver. 16; and Isaiah might have been expected to comment on it, or enforce its teaching; but he does neither. He simply states what his own attitude will be under the coming calamity (ver. 8). He will \"wait for the Lord and look to him\" (ver. 17), and consider himself and his children as doing a work for God in being \"signs\" (ver. 18) - signs to which the rest of Israel may look, and from which they may derive sufficient hope and confidence to carry them through the dark time which is approaching. Verse 17. - I will wait upon the Lord; rather, I will wait for the Lord; i.e. \"await the time of his relenting\" (see Isaiah 30:18; Isaiah 64:4, etc.). That hideth his face from the house of Jacob (compare the threats in Deuteronomy 31:17; Deuteronomy 32:20). The light of God's countenance is to the spiritual what that of the sun is to the material world. All life, health, joy, happiness, proceed from it. This light was now to be withdrawn for a time on account of the people's sins. But Isaiah would \"wait\" for its reappearance.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah8:18VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBehold, I and the children whom the LORD hath given me are for signs and for wonders in Israel from the LORD of hosts, which dwelleth in mount Zion.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 18. - I and the children... are for signs. Isaiah's children seem to have been \"for signs,\" especially in respect of their names. Shear-Jashub meant \"A remnant shall return\" (Isaiah 10:21), and thus held out two hopes; one that a remnant of Israel would return to God and become his true servants, another that a remnant would return from the captivity that had been prophesied (Isaiah 5:13). Maher-shalal-hash-baz - \"Plunder speeds, spoil hastens\" - was a \"sign\" of a different kind. Primarily, his name referred to the spoiling of Damascus and Samaria (vers. 3, 4); but it may further have indicated a time of general disturbance, plunder, and ravage. It is not quite clear in what respects Isaiah was a \"sign.\" Perhaps he, too, in his name, which meant \"(Our) salvation is Jehovah\" - certainly also in his symbolical acts (Isaiah 20:3), and possibly in the firmness of his faith, which never wavered. From the Lord of hosts; literally, from by the Lord of hosts - an expression like the French de chez. God had supernaturally appointed the sign in one case (vers. 1-4), but in the other two had merely brought them about by the secret working of his providence. But the prophet treats all three as coming equally from him. Which dwelleth in Mount Zion. Hero, again, is encouragement. God has not quitted Zion. The Shechinah still rests between the cherubim in the holy of holies. While this is so, God is still with his people (Immanuel).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah8:19VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd when they shall say unto you, Seek unto them that have familiar spirits, and unto wizards that peep, and that mutter: should not a people seek unto their God? for the living to the dead?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 19-22. - ISAIAH RECOMMENDS LOOKING TO GOD AND THE REVEALED WORD RATHER THAN TO NECROMANCY. AFFLICTION WILL BRING ISRAEL TO GOD. Isaiah returns, in ver. 19, to the consideration of his disciples. In the terrible times impending, they will be recommended to have recourse to necromancy; he urges that they should look to God and the Law. He then further suggests that, in the coming affliction which he describes (vers. 21, 22), men will generally turn for relief to the same quarter (ver. 20). Verse 19. - Seek unto them that have familiar spirits. In times of great distress the Israelites seem always to have been tempted to consult those among them who pretended to magic and divination. So Saul in the Philistine war resorted to the witch of Endor (1 Samuel 28:7-20); Manasseh, threatened by Esar-haddon, \"used enchantments, and dealt with familiar spirits and wizards\" (2 Kings 21:6). Israel generally, oppressed by Syria and Assyria, \"used divination and enchantments\" (2 Kings 17:17). There was the same inclination now on the part of many Jews. The vexed question of the actual powers possessed by such persons cannot be discussed within the limits of a footnote. It has, moreover, already been treated in the present Commentary, in connection with Leviticus 19:31. Wizards that peep, and that mutter; rather, that chirp and mutter. Tricks of the ventriloquists, probably, who disguised their voices, and represented that they were the voices of ghosts (comp. Isaiah 29:4). The natural speech of some tribes has been compared to the \"chirping of birds\" (Herod., 4:183; Hornemann, 'Travels,' p. 119). Should not a people, etc.? Very abrupt and elliptical Isaiah means to say, \"Do not attend to them; but answer, Should not a people,\" etc.? For the living. This may either mean \"instead of the living,\" or \"on behalf of the living seek to the dead?\" or, Would not that be plainly preposterous?NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah8:20VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTTo the law and to the testimony: if they speak not according to this word, it is because there is no light in them.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 20. - To the Law and to the testimony. A sort of watchword or battle-cry, to be used by the faithful when God's enemies assailed them. Compare Gideon's cry (Judges 7:18), \"For the Lord and for Gideon.\" If they speak not according to this word, it is because there is no light in them; rather, Surely they will speak according to this word, when there is no dawn for them; i.e. when they are plunged in darkness (ver. 22) and distress, and see no prospect of better days, surely they - the people generally - will rally to this cry, and repeat it, \"For the Law and for the testimony.\" They will not always trust in necromancy.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah8:21VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd they shall pass through it, hardly bestead and hungry: and it shall come to pass, that when they shall be hungry, they shall fret themselves, and curse their king and their God, and look upward.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 21, 22 are supposed by some to be cut of place, and to belong properly to the description of the Assyrian invasion, given in vers. 7, 8. But this bold solution of a difficulty is scarcely to be commended, there being no limit to its use. An order followed in all the manuscripts should not be disturbed, if it gives any tolerable sense. Such a sense can, it is thought, be found here by regarding the two verses as exegetical of the last clause of ver. 20 - \"when there is no dawn for them.\" Verse 21. - They shall pass through it. \"It,\" which is feminine, must mean \"the land.\" The Jews left in it shall wander about it (comp. Isaiah 7:21-25), seeking pasture for the remnant of their cattle. They shall fret themselves; rather, they shall be deeply angered (Cheyne). And curse their king and their God. As the causes of their sufferings. And look upward. Not in hope, but in rage and defiance.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah8:22VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd they shall look unto the earth; and behold trouble and darkness, dimness of anguish; and they shall be driven to darkness.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 22. - They shall look unto the earth. For necessary nutriment, or simply as the place to which downcast and despairing eyes are turned naturally. They shall be driven to darkness. So Kay, who thinks the Captivity is meant; but it seems better to render the whole passage, with Mr. Cheyne, \"They shall look to earth, and behold, distress and darkness, gloom of affliction, and thick darkness driven (upon them).\" The darkness is spoken of as if it were a thing palpable, like rain or snow (comp. Exodus 10:21).NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINE","Isa.9":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah9:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTNevertheless the dimness shall not be such as was in her vexation, when at the first he lightly afflicted the land of Zebulun and the land of Naphtali, and afterward did more grievously afflict her by the way of the sea, beyond Jordan, in Galilee of the nations.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 1-7 - THE TROUBLES OF ISRAEL SHALL END THROUGH THE BIRTH OF A MARVELOUS CHILD. The section of the prophecy commencing with Isaiah 7:1 terminates in this glorious burst of glad and gracious promise. The gist of the whole section is: \"Israel shall not suffer from Pekah and Rezin; her oppressors shall be Assyria and Egypt, more especially the former; Assyria shall overwhelm her, crush her, lay her low; she shall remain awhile in gloom and darkness; but at length the darkness shall be dispelled; a 'great light' shall shine forth, first in the north, then over all the land; 'the rod of the oppressor' shall be broken; a Child shall be born, who shall bear marvelous names, and shall rule over the full kingdom of David in justice and righteousness forever.\" God has spoken, and God will perform this. Verse 1. - Nevertheless the dimness shall not be such as was in her vexation, when, etc. Our translators have misconceived the construction, and consequently missed the sense. The first two clauses, which they run together, are entirely separate and distinct. Translate, Nevertheless there shall be no (more) darkness to her who was in affliction. As at the former time he brought contempt upon the land of Zebulon, etc. Contempt was brought on the more northern part of the Holy Land, first when it was overrun and ravaged by the Syrians (1 Kings 15:20) under Ben-hadad, and more recently when it bore the brunt of the Assyrian attack (2 Kings 15:29) under Tiglath-Pileser. At the first... and afterward; rather, at the former time... in the latter time. The contrast is between two periods of Israel's history, the existing period and the Messianic. And afterward did more grievously afflict her. This is altogether wrong. Translate, So in the latter time he hath brought honor on the way of the sea. The perfect is a \"prophetic perfect,\" and the reference is to the honor that would be done to the northern districts, \"the land of Zebulon and the land of Naphtali,\" by the Messiah dwelling there (comp. Matthew 4:14-16). The way of the sea; i.e. the district about the sea of Tiberias, called \"the sea of Kinnereth\" (equivalent to \"Gennesareth\") in Numbers 34:11, and \"the sea of Galilee\" in John 6:1. Beyond Jordan; i.e. the tract east of the sea and of the upper Jordan, where the five thousand were fed, and where our Lord was transfigured. Galilee of the nations. The name \"Galilee\" seems to have been given to the outlying circuit, or zone, on the north, which was debatable ground between the Israelites and their neighbors (see 1 Kings 9:11; Joshua 20:7; Joshua 21:32). The word means \"circuit,\" or \"ring.\" Though claimed as theirs by the Israelites, it was largely peopled by \"Gentiles.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah9:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe people that walked in darkness have seen a great light: they that dwell in the land of the shadow of death, upon them hath the light shined.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 2. - The people that walked in darkness (comp. Isaiah 8:22). All the world was \"in darkness\" when Christ came; but here the Jews especially seem to be intended. It was truly a dark time with them when Christ came (see Dollinger's 'Judenthum and Heidenthum,' vol. 2. pp. 301-335). Have seen; rather, saw. The \"prophetic\" preterit is used throughout the whole passage. A great light. \"The Light of the world,\" \"the Sun of righteousness,\" \"the true Light, which lighteth every man that cometh into the world, \"first broke on man in that northern tract\" by the way of the sea, \"when Jesus came forward to teach and to preach in \"Galilee of the Gentiles.\" For thirty years he had dwelt at Nazareth, in Zebulon. There he had first come forward to teach in a synagogue (Luke 4:16-21); in Galilee he had done his first miracles (John 2:11; John 4:54); at Capernaum. \"Upon the sea coast, in the borders of Zabulon and Nephthalim,\" he commenced his preaching of repentance (Matthew 4:13-17). The \"light\" first streamed forth in this quarter, glorifying the region on which contempt had long been poured.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah9:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThou hast multiplied the nation, and not increased the joy: they joy before thee according to the joy in harvest, and as men rejoice when they divide the spoil.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 3. - Thou hast multiplied the nation, and not increased the joy. Dr. Kay defends this reading, and supposes a contrast of time between this clause and the next; he renders, \"Thou didst multiply the nation\" (i.e. in the days of Solomon and again in those of Uzziah) \"and not increase the joy; but now,\" etc. The objection is that the verbs are all in the same tense, the simple preterit, and that there is nothing in the original corresponding to \"but now.\" Almost all other recent commentators accept the solution offered by the Masoretic reading (לו for לא), which makes the passage simple and easy: \"Thou hast multiplied the nation; its joy thou hast increased; they joy before thee,\" etc. (So many Hebrew manuscripts, the Alexandrine Septuagint, the Syriac, Gesenius, Knobel, Cheyne, etc.) According to the joy in harvest. \"The joy in harvest\" was to the Jews the joy of the Feast of Tabernacles, or in gathering (Exodus 23:16), held when the last fruits were brought in. But the prophet is perhaps taking a wider view, and thinking of the many harvest festivals prevailing throughout Western Asia, all of them originating in gratitude to the Giver of all good, and many of them comprising manifestations of joy more jubilant than those habitual to his sedater countrymen.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah9:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor thou hast broken the yoke of his burden, and the staff of his shoulder, the rod of his oppressor, as in the day of Midian.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 4. - Thou hast broken the yoke of his burden, etc. The coming of the Messiah sets the Israelites free, removes the yoke from off their neck, breaks the rod wherewith their shoulders were beaten, delivers them from bondage into the \"glorious liberty of the children of God.\" Not, however, in an earthly sense, since the Messiah's kingdom was not of this world. The \"yoke\" is that of sin, the \"oppressor\" is that prince of darkness, who had well-nigh brought all mankind under his dominion when Christ came. His oppressor; literally, his task-master - the same word which is used of the Egyptian taskmasters in Exodus 5:6. As in the day of Midian. The \"day of Midian\" is probably the time of Israel's deliverance from the Midianite oppression by Gideon (Judges 7:19-25). The special characteristic of the deliverance was, as Dr. Kay well observes, \"that it was accomplished without military prowess by a small body of men selected out of Israel, selected expressly in order that Israel might not vaunt itself against the Lord, saying, My own hand hath saved me (Judges 7:2).\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah9:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor every battle of the warrior is with confused noise, and garments rolled in blood; but this shall be with burning and fuel of fire.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 5. - For every battle of the warrior is with confused noise; rather, for all the armor of him that armeth noisily (Knobel, Vance Smith); or, perhaps, \"every hoof of him that trampeth noisily\" (Gesenius, Cheyne). The noun and participle, which are cognate words, occur only in this passage. And garments, etc. Translate, And every garment that is rolled in blood, shall be for burning, even fuel for fire. All military accoutrements shall be committed to the flames, that the reign of peace and justice may commence (comp. Isaiah 2:4; Psalm 46:9).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah9:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor unto us a child is born, unto us a son is given: and the government shall be upon his shoulder: and his name shall be called Wonderful, Counseller, The mighty God, The everlasting Father, The Prince of Peace.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 6. - Unto us a child is born (comp. Isaiah 7:14-16, where the promise of \"a child,\" \"a son,\" is first made - a child who was, like this Child, to be \"God with us\"). The government shall be upon his shoulder. The word translated \"government\" (misrah) occurs only here and in ver. 7. It is probably to be connected with sat, \"prince,\" and Israel. Government was regarded as a burden, to be born on the back or shoulders, and was sometimes symbolized by a key laid upon the shoulder (Isaiah 22:22). Vizier means \"burdened.\" The Latin writers often speak of the civil power as borne on the shoulders of magistrates (Cic., 'Orat. pro Flacc,' § 95; Plin., 'Paneg.,' § 10). As God, our Lord governed all things from the beginning; as man, he set up a \"kingdom\" which he still governs - upon the earth. His name shall be called. It is perhaps not very important whether we view what follows as one name or several. Isaiah does not really mean that the \"Child\" should bear as a name, or names, any of the expressions, but only that they should be truly applicable to him. Wonderful, Counselor. It has been proposed to unite these two expressions and translate, \"Wondrous Counselor\" (compare \"wonderful in counsel,\" Isaiah 28:29). But Dr. Kay is probably right in saying that, if this had been the meaning, it would have been expressed differently. Gesenius, Rosenmüller, Delitzsch, and Vance Smith agree with Dr. Kay in taking the words separately. Wonderful. The Messiah would be \"wonderful\" in his nature as God-Man; in his teaching, which \"astonished\" those who heard it (Matthew 7:28); in his doings (Isaiah 25:1); in the circumstances of his birth and death; in his resurrection, and in his ascension. \"Wonder\" would be the first sentiment which his manifestation would provoke, and hence this descriptive epithet is placed first. As the Word, as Wisdom itself, as he who says, \"Counsel is mine, and sound wisdom: I am Understanding\" (Proverbs 8:14), he is well named \"Counselor.\" None will ever seek his counsel in vain, much less repent of following it. The mighty God; rather, perhaps, Mighty God; but the difference is not great, since El, God, contains within itself the notion of singularity, which is given to ordinary nouns by the article. The term El, God, had been previously applied to the Messiah only in Psalm 45:6. It denotes in Isaiah always (as Mr. Cheyne observes) \"divinity in an absolute sense; it is never used hyperbolically or metaphorically.\" The Everlasting Father; rather, Everlasting or Eternal Father. But here, again, there is a singularity in the idea, which makes the omission of the article unimportant; for how could there be more than one Everlasting Father, one Creator, Preserver, Protector of mankind who was absolutely eternal? If the term \"Father,\" applied to our Lord, grates on our ears, we must remember that the distinction of Persons in the Godhead had not yet been revealed. The Prince of Peace; literally, Prince of Peace. A \"Prince of Peace\" had been long shadowed forth, as in Melchizedek, \"King of Salem,\" i.e. \"of Peace;\" and again in Solomon, \"the peaceful one;\" and Isaiah himself had already prophesied the peacefulness of the Messiah's kingdom (Isaiah 2:4). Compare the song of the angels at our Lord's birth (Luke 2:14). If the peacefulness has not vet very clearly shown itself, the reason would seem to be that our Lord's kingdom has yet to come into the hearts of most men.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah9:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTOf the increase of his government and peace there shall be no end, upon the throne of David, and upon his kingdom, to order it, and to establish it with judgment and with justice from henceforth even for ever.

The Messiah's kingdom shall ever increase more and more; there shall be no limits to it; ultimately it shall fill the world (comp. Matthew 28:18, 19). The continual spread of Christianity tends to the accomplishment of this prophecy. Upon the throne of David, and upon his kingdom. That the Messiah is to sit on the throne of David, suggests, but does not absolutely imply, his Davidic descent. That descent is, however, announced with sufficient clearness in Isaiah 11:1, 10. To order it, and to establish it. A gradual establishment of the kingdom would seem to be implied, such as is taught also in the parables of the mustard seed and the leaven. From henceforth even forever. The kingdom is to be both universal in respect of extent (see the first note on the verse), and in respect of duration eternal. The zeal; or, jealousy. God's jealousy of his own honor, which is bound up with the prosperity and final triumph of his people over all their enemies, will assure the performance of all that is here prophesied.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah9:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe Lord sent a word into Jacob, and it hath lighted upon Israel.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 8-21. - THE PROPHET RETURNS TO THREATS AND WARNINGS, ADDRESSED CHIEFLY TO THE KINGDOM OF ISRAEL. The remainder of this chapter, together with the first four verses of the next, seems to have formed originally a distinct and separate prophecy. The passage is a poem in four stanzas, with the same refrain at the end of each: \"For all this his anger is not turned away, but his hand is stretched out still.\" A somewhat early date has been assigned to the prophecy, as; for instance, \"some period in the reign of Jotham\" (Cheyne); but the internal evidence only proves that it was written before the destruction of Samaria by the Assyrians. Verse 8. - Jacob... Israel. These words do not show that the prophecy is directed against the kingdom of Israel only. \"Jacob\" designates Judah rather than Israel in Isaiah 2:3, 5, 6; and the expression, \"both the houses of Israel,\" in Isaiah 8:14, shows that the term \"Israel\" embraces both kingdoms. Tim distinctive names by which Isaiah ordinarily designates the northern kingdom are \"Ephraim\" and \"Samaria.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah9:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd all the people shall know, even Ephraim and the inhabitant of Samaria, that say in the pride and stoutness of heart,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 9. - Even Ephraim; rather, especially Ephraim.

Bricks were the ordinary material for the poorer class of houses in Palestine; stone was reserved for the dwellings of the rich and great (Amos 5:11). Sycamore wood was the commonest sort of timber, cedar the scarcest and most precious, having to be imported from Phoenicia (1 Kings 5:6; 2 Chronicles 2:3; Ezra 3:7). (On the contrast between cedar and sycamore wood, comp. 2 Chronicles 1:15.) Cut down. The Israelites probably alluded to damage done by Tiglath-Pileser in his first invasion. The Assyrians were in the habit of actually cutting down trees in foreign countries, in order to injure and weaken them; but the present passage is, perhaps, rather intended to be figurative.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah9:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTTherefore the LORD shall set up the adversaries of Rezin against him, and join his enemies together;VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 11. - Therefore the Lord shall set up the adversaries of Rezin against him. \"Against him\" means \"against Ephraim,\" or the kingdom of Israel. \"The adversaries of Rezin\" could only be the Assyrians; but these seem precluded by the next verse, which mentions only \"Syrians\" and Philistines.\" Hence many critics accept the variant reading of several manuscripts sarey for tsarey - which gives the sense of \"the princes of Rezin\" (so Lowth, Ewald, Houbigant, Weir, Cheyne).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah9:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe Syrians before, and the Philistines behind; and they shall devour Israel with open mouth. For all this his anger is not turned away, but his hand is stretched out still.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 12. - The Syrians before, and the Philistines behind; or, the Syrians from the east, and the Philistines from the west. The Semitic races regarded the world as looking to the rising sun, and used for the east the preposition signifying \"in front,\" for the west that signifying \"behind.\" Syria seems to have been hostile to Samaria until the league was formed between Rezin and Pekah, and may have become hostile again after Pekah's death (2 Chronicles 28:23). We read of a Philistine invasion of Judah in Chronicles (2 Chronicles 28:18), but not of their attacking Israel. Still, it was as easy for them to attack the one as the other. They abutted on the territory of Israel towards the southwest, as Syria did towards the north-east. For all this his anger is not turned away; since Israel continued impenitent. It would have ceased had they repented and turned to God (see ver. 13). His hand is stretched out; not to save, but to smite.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah9:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor the people turneth not unto him that smiteth them, neither do they seek the LORD of hosts.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 13. - The people. The people of Israel, as distinct from the people of Judah. The particular judgment announced in vers. 11, 12 is clearly to fall on them. Neither do they seek the Lord of hosts. Israel had set itself to seek after Baal from the time of Ahab (1 Kings 16:31). The reform of Jehu (2 Kings 10:28) had gone but skin-deep. Baal was still \"sought to,\" rather than Jehovah, when the final judgment came (2 Kings 17:16; Hosea 2:13).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah9:14VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTTherefore the LORD will cut off from Israel head and tail, branch and rush, in one day.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 14. - Head and tail, branch and rush; i.e. the whole nation, from the highest to the lowest. The \"branch\" intended is the \"palm branch,\" at once lofty in position and the most glorious form of vegetable life (Psalm 92:12; Song of Solomon 7:7, 8, etc.); the \"rush\" is the simple \"sedge\" that grows, not only low on the ground, but in the \"mire\" (Job 8:11).

There is no reason to doubt its being Isaiah's. Having spoken of \"the tail,\" he takes the opportunity of lashing the false prophet, who claimed to be among the \"honorable,\" but was really the lowest of the low, worse than his dupes, the true \"tail\" (comp. Isaiah 28:7; Isaiah 29:10; Isaiah 30:10).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah9:16VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor the leaders of this people cause them to err; and they that are led of them are destroyed.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 16. - The leaders of this people cause them to err (comp.

Jeroboam, the first king, introduced the calf-worship, and his successors from first to last persisted in his sin. Ahab added the still grosset idolatry of Baal. Those who held high position under the kings were equally bad examples to the people (see above, Isaiah 1:2:3). Are destroyed. First, morally corrupted and debased, then physically given over to destruction - slaughtered by Philistines, Syrians, and Assyrians.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah9:17VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTTherefore the Lord shall have no joy in their young men, neither shall have mercy on their fatherless and widows: for every one is an hypocrite and an evildoer, and every mouth speaketh folly. For all this his anger is not turned away, but his hand is stretched out still.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 17. - The Lord shall have no joy in their young men. \"The Lord taketh pleasure in them that fear him, in those that hope in his mercy\" (Psalm 147:11). He can have no joy or delight in evil-doers, or idolaters, or in those whose speech is profanity. Neither shall have mercy on their fatherless and widows. The widow and the orphan are objects of God's tenderest love and compassion (Exodus 22:22; Deuteronomy 10:18; Deuteronomy 14:29; Isaiah 1:17, etc.); but when the wickedness of a land provokes him to send any one of his \"four sore judgments\" upon it, the widow and the fatherless must suffer with the other inhabitants. God pities them, doubtless, but his justice and his righteous anger force him to restrain his pity, and carry out his judgment in spite of it. Every one is an hypocrite; or, corrupt; compare, \"They are all gone aside, they are all together become filthy; there is none that doeth good, no, not one\" (Psalm 14:3). A certain allowance must be made for the natural hyperbole of strong feeling. Every mouth speaketh folly. The word translated here (and generally) \"folly\" is rendered \"villany\" in Isaiah 32:6 and Jeremiah 29:23. Its proper meaning seems to be \"lewdness or \"profligacy.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah9:18VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor wickedness burneth as the fire: it shall devour the briers and thorns, and shall kindle in the thickets of the forest, and they shall mount up like the lifting up of smoke.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 18. - Wickedness burneth as the fire; i.e. the contagion of wickedness overspreads a whole nation in the same rapid way that fire spreads over a field of stubble or a forest. They shall mount up like the lifting up of smoke; rather, they - i.e., the forest thickets - shall be whirled upward with the uplifting of smoke. The burning thickets shall mount up with the volumes of smoke into the air, and hang there as a murky but lurid pall. The flames of wickedness give no light to a land, but lunge it in heavy, hopeless gloom.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah9:19VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThrough the wrath of the LORD of hosts is the land darkened, and the people shall be as the fuel of the fire: no man shall spare his brother.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 19. - Is the land darkened; rather, burst up (συγκέκαυται, LXX.). The root used occurs in Arabic in this sense. It is not used elsewhere in Scripture. The people shall be as the fuel of the fire. Though the general ravage, devastation, and desolation of the laud, with its buildings, its trees, and its other vegetable products, is included in the image of the fire devouring the thorny brakes and tangled thickets of a dense forest, yet the threat is intended still more against the Israelite people, who were the true \"fuel of the fire,\" since the ravage would go on until the land should be depopulated. No man shall spare his brother. We have here a new feature. Not only shall foreign enemies - Syrians and Philistines - dew, up Israel, but the plague of civil war will also be let loose upon them (comp. ver. 21, and see 2 Kings 15:30, where we find that Pekah fell a victim to a conspiracy headed by Hoshea).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah9:20VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he shall snatch on the right hand, and be hungry; and he shall eat on the left hand, and they shall not be satisfied: they shall eat every man the flesh of his own arm:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 20. - He shall snatch; rather, one shall devour. A man, i.e., shall plunder and ravage in one quarter, and yet not be satisfied; then he shall do the same in another, and still desire more. \"Increase of appetite shall grow by what it feeds on.\" There shall be no sense of satiety anywhere. The flesh of his own arm. In a civil war, or a time of anarchy, each man is always \"eating the flesh of his own arm\" - i.e. injuring his neighbor, who is his own natural protector and defender.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTIsaiah9:21VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTManasseh, Ephraim; and Ephraim, Manasseh: and they together shall be against Judah. For all this his anger is not turned away, but his hand is stretched out still.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 21. - Manasseh, Ephraim. These two are mentioned as the two principal tribes of the northern kingdom (comp. 1 Chronicles 9:3; 2 Chronicles 30:1, 10, 18; 2 Chronicles 31:1; 2 Chronicles 34:9). It is not to be supposed that civil discord was confined to them. Probably there was a general disorganization. Still, all the tribes would at any time willingly unite \"together against Judah\" (see 2 Kings 15:37; 2 Chronicles 28:6-8).NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINE",
