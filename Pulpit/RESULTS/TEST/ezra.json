"Ezra.10":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzra10:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTNow when Ezra had prayed, and when he had confessed, weeping and casting himself down before the house of God, there assembled unto him out of Israel a very great congregation of men and women and children: for the people wept very sore.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 1. - When Ezra had prayed, and when he had confessed. Rather, \"As Ezra prayed, and as he confessed.\" (Vulg.: \"Orante Esdra et implorante.\" LXX.: Ως προσηύξατο Ασδρας καὶ ὡς ἐξηγόρευσε Weeping and casting himself down. Ezra had knelt at first (Ezra 9:5); but as he proceeded, and felt more and more the heinousness of the people's transgression, he threw himself forward upon the ground, in the attitude of extremest humiliation. Before the house of God. So far as can be gathered from the context, Ezra was in the great court of the temple when the princes came to him with their information (Ezra 9:1). He at once \"sat down astonied\" (ver. 8). So he remained until preparations began to be made for the evening sacrifice, when he arose, and took up a position directly in front of the altar and the holy place, towards which he proceeded to pray. Doubtless he had in his mind the words of Solomon, assented to by God (1 Kings 9:3), and pleaded by Jehoshaphat (2 Chronicles 20:9): \"What prayer and supplication be made by any man, or by all thy people Israel, which shall know every man the plague of his own heart, and spread forth his hands towards this place: then hear thou in heaven thy dwelling-place, and forgive, and do,\" etc. (1 Kings 8:38, 39).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzra10:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Shechaniah the son of Jehiel, one of the sons of Elam, answered and said unto Ezra, We have trespassed against our God, and have taken strange wives of the people of the land: yet now there is hope in Israel concerning this thing.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 2. - Jehiel. Probably the \"Jehiel\" mentioned again in ver. 26, who was \"of the sons of Elam,\" and had married an idolatrous wife. Yet now there is hope. The penitence of the people, evidenced by their \"sore weeping, gave hope that they might be brought to amend their ways and return to God.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzra10:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTNow therefore let us make a covenant with our God to put away all the wives, and such as are born of them, according to the counsel of my lord, and of those that tremble at the commandment of our God; and let it be done according to the law.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 3. - Now therefore let us make a covenant. Shechaniah had probably in his thoughts the (comparatively) recent covenant which the people had made in the reign of Zedekiah (Jeremiah 34:15) on the subject of releasing their Hebrew slaves after six years of servitude. That covenant was entered into before God, in the temple, by the princes and all the people (ibid. ver. 10). To put away all the wives. Shechaniah probably held that marriages made contrary to the law were not merely wrongful, but invalid. At any rate, since the law of Moses, as interpreted by the Rabbis, allowed divorce \"for every cause\" (Matthew 19:3), the remedy suggested was feasible, though scarcely one which the civil power could enforce. And such as are born of them. \"Filii matrem sequuntur\" was a maxim of Roman, and, apparently, also of Jewish law. Young children require especially a mother's care. Older ones might be already tainted with idolatry. It was best, Shechaniah thought, to make a clean sweep, and dismiss the children as well as the mothers. According to the counsel of my lord. Ezra had not yet advised any course; but Shechaniah gathers from the horror which he has expressed what his wishes must be. Let it be done according to the law. Either, \"Let the law, which forbids these marriages, be in this way satisfied\" (Dathe); or, \"Let the repudiation of the wives take place in the mode prescribed by the law\" (see Deuteronomy 24:1).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzra10:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTArise; for this matter belongeth unto thee: we also will be with thee: be of good courage, and do it.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 4. - This matter belongeth unto thee. Ezra's commission was to \"let judgment be executed on those who would not do the law of God\" (Ezra 7:26), and so to constrain them to obedience. It was therefore his place to inquire into the serious matter brought before him, and set it right. We will be with thee. We, the \"very great congregation\" which had gathered around Ezra, and of whom Shechaniah was the spokesman, undertake to be with thee, and support thee, in the steps which thou takest in this matter. Only be of good courage, and act.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzra10:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen arose Ezra, and made the chief priests, the Levites, and all Israel, to swear that they should do according to this word. And they sware.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 5. - Then arose Ezra, and made the chief priests... to swear. Rather, \"made the princes, the priests, etc. to swear\" LXX.). That they would do according to this word. That they would act in the matter as Shechaniah had recommended, and put away the idolatrous wives. EZRA'S FAST (ver. 6). Matters having reached this point, the covenant having been made, and the only question remaining for consideration being how the decision come to should be carried out, Ezra \"rose up,\" and withdrew himself for a time from the people, entering into one of the side chambers of the temple, and secluding himself there. The guilt of his brethren still pressed heavily on his spirit, and he continued the mourning which he had commenced as soon as it came to his ears. To this mourning he now joined a fast of the strictest kind, an entire abstinence both from eating and drinking, like that of Moses on Mount Sinai (Exodus 34:28). Natural piety seems to have taught men generally (Jonah 3:5-7), and the Jews among them, that such abstinence was a fitting accompaniment of penitential prayer, and might be counted on to lend it additional force with Almighty God. Compare the private and personal fasts of David (2 Samuel 12:16), Ahab (1 Kings 21:27), Daniel (Daniel 9:3), and Nehemiah (Nehemiah 1:4).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzra10:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen Ezra rose up from before the house of God, and went into the chamber of Johanan the son of Eliashib: and when he came thither, he did eat no bread, nor drink water: for he mourned because of the transgression of them that had been carried away.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 6. - The chamber of Johanan. On the temple chambers see comment on Ezra 8:29. Johanan appears by Nehemiah 12:22, 23, compared with vers. 10-11, to have been really the grandson of Eliashib, who, as high priest, would have the right of assigning him a chamber in the temple (compare Nehemiah 13:4, 5). I did eat no bread nor drink water. Strict fasts of this kind had been observed by Moses twice (Exodus 34:28, and Deuteronomy 9:18), and by the Ninevites (Jonah 3:7), but they were very uncommon. Usually it was considered enough to abstain from eating (1 Samuel 1:7; 1 Samuel 20:34; 2 Samuel 3:35). Sometimes the person who fasted merely abstained from \"meat and wine, and pleasant bread (Daniel 10:3). Ezra's great earnestness appears in the severity of his fast, which (it is to be remembered) was not for his own sins, but for those of his brethren. PROCLAMATION MADE, SUMMONING ALL THE JEWS TO JERUSALEM (vers. 7- 9). After due deliberation between Ezra, the princes, and the elders (ver. 8), it was resolved, as a first step, to summon all Jews - or, rather, all those who had returned from the captivity, whether they were Jews or Israelites - to Jerusalem, in order that the decision come to with respect to the mixed marriages might be communicated to them. The limit of three days was fixed as the latest date at which any one might make his appearance, and absentees were threatened with the heavy penalties of excommunication and forfeiture of all their possessions. Proclamation having been made to this effect \"throughout Judah\" (ver. 7), there was a gathering of all the males of full age to Jerusalem within the prescribed time. The place of meeting was the great court of the temple (ver. 9). According to Hecataeus of Abdera (Fr. 14), this was \"a stone-walled enclosure, about 500 feet long and 150 feet wide,\" which might perhaps afford sitting room for 20,000 men. Deducting the aged and infirm, the sick, and those between twelve and twenty years of age, the country Jews would scarcely have reached this number.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzra10:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd they made proclamation throughout Judah and Jerusalem unto all the children of the captivity, that they should gather themselves together unto Jerusalem;VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 7. - They made proclamation. Literally, \"they made to pass a voice\" (παρήνεγ καν φωνήν - LXX.). They sent criers to make the matter known. To all the children of the captivity. i.e. to all those who, having returned from the captivity, were now in the land. The expression is a favourite one with Ezra (see Ezra 2:1; Ezra 4:1; Ezra 6:16, 19; Ezra 8:35, etc.).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzra10:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd that whosoever would not come within three days, according to the counsel of the princes and the elders, all his substance should be forfeited, and himself separated from the congregation of those that had been carried away.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 8. - Within three days. The limits of Judaea at this time appear to have been Bethel on the north, Beersheba on the south, Jericho on the east, and the Mediterranean upon the west. As the frontier was nowhere much more than forty miles from Jerusalem, three days from the day that they heard the proclamation would be sufficient time to allow all the able-bodied men to reach the capital. Forfeited. Literally, \"devoted,\" i.e. confiscated to the temple treasury. Separated from the congregation. i.e. excommunicated.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzra10:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen all the men of Judah and Benjamin gathered themselves together unto Jerusalem within three days. It was the ninth month, on the twentieth day of the month; and all the people sat in the street of the house of God, trembling because of this matter, and for the great rain.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 9. - All the men of Judah and Benjamin gathered themselves together unto Jerusalem. This is of course to be understood with certain necessary or natural exceptions, as of the sick, the aged and infirm, and the youths under full age. Still it would be a vast gathering, doubling probably for the time the population of the city. It was the ninth month. The month Chisleu, corresponding nearly to our December. All the people sat in the street of the house of God. The word translated \"street\" means any broad open space, and is probably used here to designate the great court of the temple (Patrick). By \"all the people\" we must understand as many as the court would conveniently hold. If the court had the dimensions given it by Hecataeus of Abdera, it may have accommodated the whole body of the country Jews. The great rain. December is a rainy month in Palestine; and the incidental mention of \"the great rain\" is one of those small touches which stamp the writer as an eyewitness. ADDRESS OF EZRA, AND CONSENT OF THE PEOPLE TO PUT AWAY THE STRANGE WIVES (vers. 10- 14). Hitherto Ezra seems to have allowed the leading part in the matter to be taken by the civil authorities, whom he had found established in Jerusalem on his arrival (Ezra 9:1-8). Now he came forward boldly, denouncing the sin committed, and as supreme governor commanding the repudiation of the strange wives. The assembled multitude consented, but urged that the matter required time; that the season was unsuitable for a prolonged stay of the whole body of country Jews at Jerusalem, and that the business would be most conveniently carried through by a standing commission consisting of the chief authorities of the city of Jerusalem, who should take the case of each country town separately, and, in conjunction with the elders and judges of each town, investigate the alleged mixed marriages of each locality, and adjudicate upon them. By this arrangement the bulk of the country Jews would be allowed at once to return home; and the case of each locality being taken separately, only a small number would at any given time be suffering the inconvenience of a compulsory absence from their residences, and the expense of a stay of some duration in the capital. The proposal was reasonable, and it appears to have approved itself to Ezra and his advisers, and to have been at once adopted.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzra10:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Ezra the priest stood up, and said unto them, Ye have transgressed, and have taken strange wives, to increase the trespass of Israel.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 10. - Ezra the priest stood up. Now that the time had come for action, Ezra was not wanting to his duties. The chief authority had been put into his hands by the Persian king (Ezra 7:25, 26), and he was bound to exercise it. Accordingly, the great bulk of the nation being assembled in obedience to the proclamation, Ezra came forward in person, and declared that the \"strange wives\" must be put away. Ye have taken strange wives. Literally, \"have caused to dwell,\" i.e. have made them come and live with you in the holy land.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzra10:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTNow therefore make confession unto the LORD God of your fathers, and do his pleasure: and separate yourselves from the people of the land, and from the strange wives.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 11. - Make confession. This is undoubtedly the true meaning of t'nu thodah in this place, and not \"give praise\" (δότε αἴνεσιν), as the LXX. render. Separate yourselves from the people of the land. The marriages naturally led on to familiar intercourse with the relatives and friends of the women, and so tended to break down the barrier between Jew and Gentile which it had been the special object of the Mosaic legislation to erect.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzra10:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen all the congregation answered and said with a loud voice, As thou hast said, so must we do.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzra10:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut the people are many, and it is a time of much rain, and we are not able to stand without, neither is this a work of one day or two: for we are many that have transgressed in this thing.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 13. - We are many that have transgressed. The marginal rendering, \"we have greatly offended in this thing,\" is nearer to the original. No doubt, however, the greatness of the offence consisted partly in the large number that had offended.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzra10:14VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTLet now our rulers of all the congregation stand, and let all them which have taken strange wives in our cities come at appointed times, and with them the elders of every city, and the judges thereof, until the fierce wrath of our God for this matter be turned from us.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 14. - Let now our rulers of the congregation stand. Let Ezra, together with the princes and the elders at Jerusalem (ver. 8), form a standing body to act with the elders and judges of the provincial towns in this matter, and let the case of each town be taken separately, and the inhabitants of each attend at Jerusalem in their turn. Until the fierce wrath of our God for this matter be turned from us. This is probably the true meaning of the writer, but it is not to be obtained from the ordinary text. To produce it we must read by עַל for עַד and haddabar for laddabar hazzeh. As the text stands, it is unintelligible. OPPOSITION OF JONATHAN AND OTHERS (ver. 15). It was natural that some opposition should manifest itself when so trenchant a measure was announced as that which Ezra had declared to be necessary. To compel men to divorce their wives was to touch many in the tenderest place. Nor was it difficult to bring forward very plausible arguments to show that the marriages - or at any rate some of them - were allowable. Joseph had married an Egyptian (Genesis 41:45), Moses a Midianite (Exodus 2:21). True, these marriages had taken place before the law was given; but subsequently, also, Boaz had married Ruth the Moabitess (Ruth 4:13); David had taken to wife Maacah, a Geshurite (2 Samuel 3:3); and Solomon had without blame married the daughter of a Pharaoh (1 Kings 3:1). These examples might be pleaded in proof that the Law admitted of exceptions, and individuals might argue that their cases were of an exceptional character. Again, in some instances the foreign wives may have become proselytes, and the children may have been circumcised, and so accepted into the congregation; which would give them a claim to remain, which would extend in some degree to the mothers. We therefore cannot be surprised that an opposition was made. Rather, it is remarkable that it was so slight, only extending (so far as appears) to four persons, and so easily quelled.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzra10:15VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTOnly Jonathan the son of Asahel and Jahaziah the son of Tikvah were employed about this matter: and Meshullam and Shabbethai the Levite helped them.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 15. - Only Jonathan... and Jaha-ziah... were employed about this matter. If this were the true meaning of the passage it would contradict the next verse, by which it appears that Ezra himself, together with several \"chiefs of the fathers\" - probably identical with the \"rulers and elders\" of ver. 14 - took the matter in hand, and were occupied with it for three months. The true meaning of the clause, however, is almost certainly that which was assumed in the preceding paragraph: \"Only Jonathan and Jahaziah stood up against this matter,\" or \"opposed\" it (see 1 Chronicles 21:1; Daniel 8:25; Daniel 11:14, where the same expression has the sense of \"oppose, resist\"). Meshullam and Shabbethai the Levite helped them. The \"Meshullam\" intended is perhaps the person of the name mentioned in ver. 29 as having married an idolatrous wife. The others seem not to have had any personal interest in thwarting Ezra and preventing the reform. SETTLEMENT OF THE WHOLE MATTER BY THE REPUDIATION OF THE STRANGE WIVES (vers. 16, 17). The opposition made did not delay the business more than a few days. The great assembly had been held on the twentieth day of the ninth month. On the first day of the tenth month, little more than a week later, the commission for examining into the matter met under the presidency of Ezra, and commenced proceedings. The method of proceeding suggested at the great meeting was no doubt followed. The case of each city was taken separately. Its male inhabitants of full age attended, and its \"elders\" and \"judges\" sat on the commission as assessors while the conjugal position of their townsfolk was being investigated. Where a \"mixed marriage\" was proved the wife was repudiated. In 112 cases the necessity of repudiation was made out to the satisfaction of the commission, and this number of wives was put away. Probably the entire number of cases adjudicated upon was very much greater, since the commission continued at work for three months, and probably sat on seventy-five different days, judging (we may presume) three or four cases a day. On the whole, the small extent to which the evil had prevailed is remarkable; for 112 mixed marriages in a population where the adult males were about 40,000 would give only one such marriage to three hundred or three hundred and fifty legitimate ones. Nevertheless, evils in a community are not to be judged simply by their prevalence. Great evils must be checked at once, even though they have not extended far, lest, if they spread at all widely, they become irremediable. Ezra is to be commended for having perceived the greatness of the peril, and for having taken prompt and decided measures to check it, without waiting till it had got to a head, and so become uncontrollable.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzra10:16VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the children of the captivity did so. And Ezra the priest, with certain chief of the fathers, after the house of their fathers, and all of them by their names, were separated, and sat down in the first day of the tenth month to examine the matter.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 16. - The children of the captivity did so. The people generally, notwithstanding the opposition of Jonathan, acquiesced in Ezra's decision, and acted accordingly. Ezra the priest, with certain chief of the fathers. There is no \"with,\" or other connective, in the original; but our translators did right in supplying one, since the conjunction ו, \"and,\" has almost certainly fallen out of the text by the mistake of a copyist. After the house of their fathers. Rather, \"for each father's house\" - i.e. \"for each family.\" It would seem from this clause that each recognised family was represented on the commission by its head. The number of such families appears by Ezra 2:3-61 to have been ninety-eight. And all of them by their names. Compare with this Ezra 8:20. In both places Ezra probably means that a list of the names was made out, and was in his possession, though he does not think it necessary to give them. Were separated. i.e. \"set apart for the business.\" And they sat down, i.e. \"began their sittings,\" on the first day of the tenth month, the month Tebeth, corresponding nearly to our January.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzra10:17VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd they made an end with all the men that had taken strange wives by the first day of the first month.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 17. - They made an end with all the men. They ran through the whole list of those who were accused of having taken strange wives, and adjudicated on every case, by the first day of the first month, Nisan, corresponding nearly with our April. Deducting Sabbaths, the number of days in the three months would be seventy-five or seventy-six; but it is of course possible that the court did not sit continuously. THE NAMES OF THOSE WHO HAD MARRIED THE STRANGE WIVES (vers. 18-44). Aware of the danger that the nation might relapse into the sin which he was seeking to root out, Ezra punishes the wrong-doers by placing their names on record, that others might fear to do the like. He assigns the first place in his catalogue of offenders to the priests, doubtless because in them the sin was greatest; they, as the special custodians of the Law, were most bound to have observed the Law. Next to the priests he puts the Levites, on the same principle, because of their semi-sacerdotal character. He then concludes with the laymen, arranged under their several families. By the list of laymen it appears that ten only out of some thirty-six lay families were implicated in the sin. Three of the four priestly families, on the other hand, and even the near-kindred of the high priest, were among the guilty. It is remarkable that it is Ezra, a priest, and one by many accused of over-sacerdotalism, who gives this testimony against his own order.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzra10:18VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd among the sons of the priests there were found that had taken strange wives: namely, of the sons of Jeshua the son of Jozadak, and his brethren; Maaseiah, and Eliezer, and Jarib, and Gedaliah.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 18. - Joshua the son of Jozadak is, undoubtedly, the high priest of chs. 3. and 5. Four members of his family had committed the sin (compare Nehemiah 13:28).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzra10:19VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd they gave their hands that they would put away their wives; and being guilty, they offered a ram of the flock for their trespass.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 19. - They gave their hands that they would put away their wives. It is not clear whether this is intended to be said of Maaseiah, Eliezer, Jarib, and Gedaliah only, or of the entire body of persons found guilty of having married strange wives. Most probably the court made out the divorces in the generality of cases, but were content to take a solemn pledge from members of the high priest's family.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzra10:20VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd of the sons of Immer; Hanani, and Zebadiah.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 20-22. - On the priestly families of Immer, Harim, and Pashur see above, Ezra 2:37-39.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzra10:21VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd of the sons of Harim; Maaseiah, and Elijah, and Shemaiah, and Jehiel, and Uzziah.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzra10:22VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd of the sons of Pashur; Elioenai, Maaseiah, Ishmael, Nethaneel, Jozabad, and Elasah.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzra10:23VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAlso of the Levites; Jozabad, and Shimei, and Kelaiah, (the same is Kelita,) Pethahiah, Judah, and Eliezer.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzra10:24VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTOf the singers also; Eliashib: and of the porters; Shallum, and Telem, and Uri.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 24. - The singers and porters.

The context shows that it is the first year of Cyrus at Babylon which is intended. Cyrus the Great became King of Persia by his final defeat and capture of Astyages, in B.C. 559 probably. His conquest of Babylon was, comparatively speaking, late in his reign (Herod., Xenoph.), and is fixed by the Canon of Ptolemy to B.C. 538. He took the city on the night of Belshazzar's feast (Daniel 5:30), when Daniel had just been appointed to the third place in the kingdom (ibid. ver. 29), and was practically at the head of affairs. Thus the great king and the great prophet of the time were brought into contact, and naturally conferred together, as may be gathered from Josephus ('Ant. Jud.,' 11:1). That the word of the Lord by the mouth of Jeremiah might be fulfilled. The reference is to Jeremiah 25:11, 12, and Jeremiah 29:10. Jeremiah had prophesied not only the fact, but the date of the return, by assigning to the captivity a duration of \"seventy years.\" There might be some doubt when exactly this term would run out, since the year of 360 was in prophetic use no less than the year of 365 days ('Dict. of the Bible,' s.v. YEAR), and, moreover, the exact date of the commencement of the captivity admitted of question; but Daniel appears to have calculated in B.C. 538 that the term was approaching its termination (see Daniel 9:2-19). If the captivity were regarded as commencing in the third year of Jehoiakim (Daniel 1:1, 2), which was B.C. 606-605, and if years of 360 days were regarded as intended, this would clearly be so, since 360 x 70 = 25,200, and 365 × 68 = 24,820, so that in B.C. 538 only another year was wanting. For the prophecy to be fulfilled, it was requisite that the first steps towards bringing about the return and the cessation of desolation should not be delayed beyond the close of B.C. 538. The Lord, accordingly, in this year stirred up the spirit of Cyrus, king of Persia. As God in earlier times had worked on the minds of Abimelech (Genesis 20:3) and Balaam (Numbers 23:5, 16), and more recently of Nebuchadnezzar (Daniel 2:28), so now, it would seem, he directly influenced the heart and will of Cyrus. This is the less surprising, as Cyrus was, in the Divine counsels, fore-ordained to do this work, and had been raised to his high station for the purpose (Isaiah 44:28; Isaiah 45:1-4). Cyrus was thus induced to make a proclamation (literally, \"to make to pass a voice\") throughout the whole kingdom, which reached from the AEgean Sea to the borders of India, and from the Caucasus to the Persian Gulf, and even to put it in writing, b miktab, that so it might be sure to become generally known. Writing was probably of recent introduction into Persia; but there is positive evidence in the native remains of its use by Cyrus. His proclamation was probably issued in at least two languages, Persian and Chaldee.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzra1:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThus saith Cyrus king of Persia, The LORD God of heaven hath given me all the kingdoms of the earth; and he hath charged me to build him an house at Jerusalem, which is in Judah.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 2. - Thus saith Cyrus. Persian inscriptions do not ordinarily commence in this way; but the formula \"says Darius the king,\" \"says Xerxes the king\" is frequent in them. King of Persia. So the Behistun inscription: \"I am Darius, the great king, the king of kings, the king of Persia.\" The Lord God of heaven, Yehovah Elohey hashshamayim. \"God of heaven\" seems to have been a usual title of the Supreme Being among the Persians (see below, Ezra 6:9, 10; Ezra 7:12, 23), and perhaps designated Ormuzd in contradistinction to Ahriman, who was lord of the infernal regions. The use of the term \"Jehovah,\" instead of Ormuzd, is remarkable, and was probably limited to the Hebrew transcript of the proclamation. Hath given me all the kingdoms of the earth. An acknowledgment that they have received and hold their royal power from Ormuzd is universal on the part of all the Persian kings who have left inscriptions of any length; but they do not often indulge in such a hyperbole as this of Cyrus. Artaxerxes Ochus, however, calls himself \"king of this world\" (Rawlinson, 'Cuneiform Inser.,' vol. 1. p. 341). The mention of the \"kingdoms of the earth\" is appropriate, since Cyrus had not inherited his empire, but built it up by the conquest of a vast number of independent states ('Herod.' 1. passim). His earn feeling that God had in all cases given him the victory harmonizes with the statement of Isaiah in Isaiah 45:1. He hath charged me to build him a house at Jerusalem. The he is emphatic, and is expressed by αὐτὸς in the Septuagint and ipse in the Vulgate. He himself, Jehovah-Elohim, has given it me in charge to build him a house. Most critics rightly explain by referring to Isaiah 44:28, and accepting the statement of Josephus ('Ant. Jud.,' 11:1) that the passage was shown to Cyrus shortly after his capture of Babylon. He understood the prophecy as a command, and proceeded to obey it. Which is in Judah. The addition of this clause marks strongly the oblivion into which the ruined city had fallen. Apparently, it was necessary, to recall its situation to men's minds by an express mention of the province whereof it had been the capital. Note the repetition of the clause in the next verse.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzra1:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWho is there among you of all his people? his God be with him, and let him go up to Jerusalem, which is in Judah, and build the house of the LORD God of Israel, (he is the God,) which is in Jerusalem.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 3. - Who (is there) among you of all his people? Cyrus does not limit his address to the Jews, or even to Judah and Benjamin, but extends it to the whole people of Jehovah, i.e. to all the tribes equally. Gozan and Media, to which the ten tribes had been transported by the Assyrian monarchs, were within his dominions no less than Babylonia. That many non-Jewish Israelites did return appears from 1 Chronicles 9:3. His God be with him. A pious wish, almost a blessing, indicative of the deep religious feeling and great goodness of heart which characterized Cyrus alone of Persian monarchs. Among the Greeks, AEschylus, who first speaks of him, calls him kindly\" or \"gracious\" (εὔφραιν); Herodotus says he ruled his subjects like a father; Xenophon makes him a model prince; Plutarch observes that \"in wisdom and virtue and greatness of soul he excelled all other kings;\" Diodorus ascribes to him a remarkable power of self-command, together with good feeling and gentleness. The Latin writers, Cicero and others, add their meed of praise; and altogether it may be said that, so far as the evidence reaches, no nobler character appears in ancient history. The Scriptural notices, whether in this book or in Isaiah, are in remarkable accord. Let him go up. Jerusalem was on a much higher level than Babylon, and the travellers would consequently have to ascend considerably. And build the house. The \"charge\" to Cyrus did not require him to take a personal share in the building. He was simply to \"say to Jerusalem, Thou shalt be built; and to the temple, Thy foundation shall be laid\" (Isaiah 44:28). He is therefore content to assign the actual work to others. He is the God. The Septuagint and the Vulgate attach the last clause of the verse to these words, and render \"He is the God who is in Jerusalem,\" which greatly weakens the force of the expression. According to this punctuation, Cyrus makes Jehovah a mere local Deity; according to the far preferable arrangement of the A. V., he declares emphatically that Jehovah is the one true God, beside whom there is no other. Compare the very similar confession of Nebuchadnezzar (Daniel 6:26).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzra1:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd whosoever remaineth in any place where he sojourneth, let the men of his place help him with silver, and with gold, and with goods, and with beasts, beside the freewill offering for the house of God that is in Jerusalem.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 4. - Whosoever remaineth in any place where he sojourneth. Literally correct; but the meaning is, \"And with regard to all those who remain (of the captive people) in any part of the country where they have their temporary abode, let the men of his district help him with silver,\" etc. Cyrus finishes his decree by calling upon his heathen subjects to come to the aid of the poorer Israelites, and assist them with money, cattle, and other commodities, in order that none may be hindered by poverty, or by the want of beasts of burthen, from joining the band of emigrants, and setting out on their return to Jerusalem. Again, the kindliness of his disposition is apparent. Beside the freewill offering. So the Septuagint; but the Vulgate has, \"Except the freewill offering,\" etc. The Septuagint and the A. V. are right. Cyrus means that money, cattle, and goods are to be made over to the poorer Israelites, in addition to any offering that might be intrusted to them for conveyance to Jerusalem, either by himself or by his subjects. Individually, he was about to send \"a freewill offering,\" consisting of a number of gold and silver vessels for the service of the temple. His words suggest that his subjects might follow this good example.NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzra1:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen rose up the chief of the fathers of Judah and Benjamin, and the priests, and the Levites, with all them whose spirit God had raised, to go up to build the house of the LORD which is in Jerusalem.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 5. - Then rose up the chief of the fathers.

Besides all that was willingly offered (comp. ver. 4). The gold, silver, precious things, etc. previously mentioned were free gifts to individual Jews, and were additional to certain offerings which were intrusted to them for conveyance to Jerusalem.

Which Nebuchadnezzar had brought forth. The carrying off of sacred vessels, as well as images, from temples is often represented in the Assyrian sculptures. It was a practice even of the Romans, and is commemorated on the Pillar of Titus, where the seven-branched candlestick of the Jewish temple is represented as borne in triumph by Roman soldiers. And had put them in the house of his gods. Elohayv, which is the form used in the text, can only mean \"his god,\" not his gods. Nebuchadnezzar represents himself, in his inscriptions generally, as a special devotee of a single Babylonian god, Merodach, whose temple, called by the Greeks that of Bel, is no doubt here intended (comp. Daniel 1:2).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzra1:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTEven those did Cyrus king of Persia bring forth by the hand of Mithredath the treasurer, and numbered them unto Sheshbazzar, the prince of Judah.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 8. - Mithredath the treasurer. Not \"Mithridates, the son of Gazabar,\" as the Vulgate renders. The Hebrew gizbar represents a Persian word, gazabara or ganzabara, which had no doubt the meaning of \"treasurer,\" literally \"treasure-bearer. We have here the first occurrence of the famous name, borne by so many great kings, of Mithridates. The name is thoroughly Persian, and is excellently rendered by the Hebrew מִתְיְדָת. It means either \"given by Mithra\" or \"dedicated to Mithra,\" and is distinct evidence of the worship of Mithra by the Persians as early as the time of Cyrus. Mithra was the sun, and was venerated as Mitra by the early Vedic Indians. His worship in later Persia is clearly established; but, except for the name of Mithredath in this place, it would have been doubtful whether he was as yet an object of religious veneration to the Iranians. Sheshbazzar. It is generally allowed that this was the Chaldaean or court name of Zerubbabel. (The chief evidence of this is to be found in Ezra 5:16 compared with Ezra 3:8.) What the name signified is uncertain. The prince of Judah. Zerubbabel was the son of Pedaiah, brother of Salathiel, who was the legal heir of Jehoiachin, king of Judah. He appears to have been adopted by Salathiel as his son, and to have been recognized as the legitimate heir to the throne of David. Thus he did not owe his appointment to the mere favour of Cyrus, but was the natural leader of the people.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzra1:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd this is the number of them: thirty chargers of gold, a thousand chargers of silver, nine and twenty knives,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 9. - Chargers.

Machaldaphim, another rare word of doubtful sense. The LXX. render παρηλλαγμένα, \"changes,\" regarding the word as derived from חלã, \"to exchange.\" The apocryphal Esdras has θυίσκαι \"censers.\" But the most usual translation is that of the A.

The twelve are reasonably regarded as either the actual heads of the twelve tribes, or at any rate as representing them. Notwithstanding the small number among the returned exiles who belonged to other tribes than those of Judah, Benjamin, and Levi, there was a manifest wish on the part of the chiefs to regard the return as in some sort that of all the tribes (see Ezra 2:70; Ezra 6:17; Ezra 8:35, etc.).

The lists in Nehemiah and the apocryphal Esdras differ in many details, and furnish strong evidence of the corruption to which numbers are liable from the mistakes of copyists, and the facility of error when there is no check from the context.

The other places here mentioned are unknown to us, but probably belonged to the same tract of country. Tel-Harsa means \"Hill of the Wood.\" They could not show their father's house. It is more surprising that so many of the returning exiles had preserved their genealogies than that a certain number had omitted to do so.

Haggai calls Zerubbabel uniformly pechah, \"governor (Haggai 1:1, 14; Haggai 2:2, 21). They should not eat of the most holy things. The priests' portion of the offerings, called \"most holy\" in Leviticus 2:2, 10, is intended. Of this no \"stranger\" might eat (ibid. 22:10). Till there stood up a priest with Urim and Thummim. Zerubbabel evidently expected that the power of obtaining direct answers from God by means of the Urim and Thummim, whatever they were (see note on Exodus 28:30), which had existed in the pre-captivity Church, would be restored when the Church was re-established in its ancient home. The doubt whether the families of Habaiah and Coz (or Haccoz) belonged to the priestly class or no might then be resolved. But Zerubbabel's expectation was disappointed. The gift of Urim and Thum-mira, forfeited by disobedience, was never recovered.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzra2:64VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe whole congregation together was forty and two thousand three hundred and threescore,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 64. - The whole congregation together was forty and two thousand three hundred and threescore. Ezra's numbers, as given in detail (vers. 3-60), produce when added together a total of only 29,818; Nehemiah's items (Nehemiah 7:8-62) give a total of 31,089; those of the apocryphal Esdras a total of 33,950. The three authorities agree, however, in their summation, all alike declaring that the actual number of those who returned with Zerubbabel was 42,360. Esdras adds that children under twelve years of age are not included. If this were so, the entire number must have exceeded 50,000 - an enormous body of persons to transport a distance of above a thousand miles, according to Western experience, but one which will not surprise those acquainted with the East. In the East caravans of from ten to twenty thousand souls often traverse huge distances without serious mishap, and migrations frequently take place on a much grander scale. In the year 1771, 50,000 families of Torgouths, reckoned to number 300,000 souls, arrived on the frontiers of China, after a journey of 10,000 leagues through a most difficult country, and were given lands in the Chinese empire. They were followed in the next year by 180,000 Eleuths and others, who had accomplished a similar distance (see De Hell, 'Travels,' pp. 228, 229). Jenghis Khan is said to have forced 100,000 artisans and craftsmen to emigrate in a body from Khiva into Mongolia (Howarth's 'History of the Mongols,' p. 85). The transplantation of entire nations was an established practice among the Assyrians, Babylonians, and Persians. THE NUMBER OF THE SLAVES, HORSES, MULES, CAMELS, AND ASSES OF THOSE WHO RETURNED (vers, 65-67). It may seem strange that matters of this trivial character should be recorded with such exactness in Holy Writ; but enumerations similar in character are not unfrequent (see Genesis 23:14, 15; 2 Chronicles 17:11; Job 42:12). They may perhaps be viewed as teaching the lesson that with God nothing is too trivial for exact knowledge, even \"all the hairs of our head\" being \"numbered\" (Matthew 10:30). In the present passage the enumeration is not altogether without a further historical value, since it is indicative of the general poverty and low estate of the returning exiles, who had but one slave and one ass to every six of their number, one horse to every sixty, one camel to every hundred, and one mule to every one hundred and seventy-five.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzra2:65VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBeside their servants and their maids, of whom there were seven thousand three hundred thirty and seven: and there were among them two hundred singing men and singing women.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 65. - Two hundred singing men and singing women. Nehemiah says two hundred and forty-five, and so the apocryphal Esdras. Perhaps, in the great default of Levites, the services of these persons may have been used to swell the sacred choruses of the time (Ezra 3:10). Hence, it may be, the mention of this otherwise unimportant fact.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzra2:66VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTTheir horses were seven hundred thirty and six; their mules, two hundred forty and five;VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzra2:67VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTTheir camels, four hundred thirty and five; their asses, six thousand seven hundred and twenty.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 67. - Their asses. The ass (we see) is still, as in the earlier times, the chief beast of burden employed by the Israelites. Horses are rare, camels and mules still rarer; but most emigrant families had, it would seem, one ass (comp. 1 Samuel 8:16; 1 Chronicles 27:30; Isaiah 30:6).NEWLINENEWLINECHAPTER 2:68-70 THE OFFERINGS MADE BY THE RETURNED EXILES ON THEIR ARRIVAL AT JERUSALEM (vers. 68-70). It has been customary among the pious of all ages and countries to make thank-offerings to the Almighty on the accomplishment of any important or dangerous work. The long journey of the exiles from Babylonia to Jerusalem involved considerable risk (see Ezra 8:22, 31), and its successful termination naturally called forth their gratitude. The character of the offerings made is indicative of the fact, otherwise probable, that the exiles had turned all that they possessed into money, and had brought to Jerusalem a considerable amount of coin.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzra2:68VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd some of the chief of the fathers, when they came to the house of the LORD which is at Jerusalem, offered freely for the house of God to set it up in his place:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 68. - Some of the chief of the fathers. That is, \"Some of the heads of families.\" Each family went up under a recognized head or chief, the number of such heads being, as it would seem, nearly a hundred (vers. 3-61). When they came to the house of the Lord. No doubt considerable ruins of Solomon's temple existed when the exiles returned, and were easily to be recognized, both by their situation and by the size of the stones employed (1 Kings 5:17). The place occupied by these rums was that whereto the emigrants flocked, and about which they, in the first instance, located themselves. Offered freely for the house of God, to set it up in its place. The first object of the returned exiles was the rebuilding of the temple, and their offerings were consequently given expressly towards the expenses of this costly work.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzra2:69VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThey gave after their ability unto the treasure of the work threescore and one thousand drams of gold, and five thousand pound of silver, and one hundred priests' garments.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 69. - After their ability. As each was able; the richer more, the poorer less. Threescore and one thousand drams of gold. The word translated \"dram\" is darkemon, which appears to be the Hebrew representative of the Persian word which the Greeks rendered by dareikos, or \"daric.\" This was a gold coin, stamped with the figure of a Persian king, wearing his crown, and armed with a bow and arrow. According to the most exact computation, each such coin contained somewhat more pure gold than an English guinea, and was worth £1 1s. 10.5d. of our money. The 61,000 darics would therefore have been equal to £66,718 15s. Five thousand pounds of silver. The word translated \"pound\" is maneh, an equivalent of the Greek tuna and the Latin mind. In Greece the silver mind was worth a little more than £4 of our money. The value of the Hebrew silver munch is uncertain, but probably was not very different from the Greek. Thus the sum contributed in silver may be estimated at above £20,000, and the entire contribution at nearly £90,000. It must be noted, however, that Nehemiah's estimate (Nehemiah 7:71, 72) is less. One hundred priests' garments. Nehemiah says ninety-seven (ibid. vers. 70, 72), whence we may conclude that Ezra uses a round number.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzra2:70VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTSo the priests, and the Levites, and some of the people, and the singers, and the porters, and the Nethinims, dwelt in their cities, and all Israel in their cities.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 70. - In their cities. Not in Jerusalem only, but in the neighboring towns also, e.g. Bethlehem, Anathoth, Ramah, Gaba, Michmash, Bethel, Ai, Nebo, and Jericho (see above, comment on ver. 1). All Israel. Ezra very determinately puts forward this aspect of the return - that it was participated in by all the tribes (see 2:2; 3:1; 6:16, 17; 7:13; 8:29, 35, etc.). He does not, however, exclude the other aspect, that it was especially a return of Judah, or \"Judah and Benjamin\" (see Ezra 5:1; Ezra 10:9).NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINE","Ezra.3":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzra3:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd when the seventh month was come, and the children of Israel were in the cities, the people gathered themselves together as one man to Jerusalem.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 1. - When the seventh month was come. The seventh month was Tisri, and corresponded nearly to our October. It was the most sacred month of the Jewish year, commencing with a blowing of trumpets and a holy convocation on the first day (Leviticus 23:24), which was followed on the tenth day by the solemn day of atonement (ibid. ver. 27; comp. Leviticus 16:29-34), and on the fifteenth day by the feast of tabernacles or \"ingathering,\" one of the three great annual festivals, which lasted to the twenty-second day. Zerubbabel and Joshua determined to risk a disturbance rather than defer the restoration of the altar beyond the commencement of this sacred month. The people gathered themselves together. The people were bound to attend the feast of tabernacles (Exodus 23:14-16); but something more than this seems to be intended. The restoration of the altar and the re-establishment of the daily sacrifice having been announced, there was a general influx of the country Israelites into Jerusalem to witness the proceedings. As one man. Very emphatic (comp. Judges 20:1, 8; 2 Samuel 19:14).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzra3:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen stood up Jeshua the son of Jozadak, and his brethren the priests, and Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, and his brethren, and builded the altar of the God of Israel, to offer burnt offerings thereon, as it is written in the law of Moses the man of God.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 2. - Jeshua the son of Jozadak. The position of Jeshua, both here and in vers. 8, 9, sufficiently marks him as the high priest, though Ezra does not give him the title. Haggai, however (Ezra 1:1, 14; 2:2), and Zechariah (Ezra 3:1, 8; Ezra 6:11) distinctly assign him the office. His father, Jozadak, or Josedech, was the son of Seraiah, high priest at the destruction of Jerusalem (1 Chronicles 6:14). The name Jeshua is a mere variant of Joshua, and so corresponds to Jesus, of whom Jeshua may be regarded as a type. His brethren the priests. As being all of them equally descended from Aaron, the priests were \"brethren.\" Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel. See note on Ezra 2:2, where Zerubbabel's actual descent is given. And his brethren. Such other members of the royal house as had returned with him. As it is written in the law. See Leviticus 17:2-6; Deuteronomy 12:5-11. It was an express command of God to the Israelites that sacrifice should be offered only at Jerusalem in the place which he should appoint. Moses the man of God. That is, \"the Prophet;\" but the phrase is emphatic, and characteristic of Ezra (comp. 1 Chronicles 23:14 and 2 Chronicles 30:16).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzra3:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd they set the altar upon his bases; for fear was upon them because of the people of those countries: and they offered burnt offerings thereon unto the LORD, even burnt offerings morning and evening.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 3. - They set the altar upon his bases. They built the new altar upon the foundations of the old one, making it exactly conform to them. This was done, no doubt, to indicate that the religion which the exiles brought back from Babylon was in every respect identical with that which they had possessed before they were carried thither. Many moderns hold the contrary; but it has not yet been proved that the sojourn at Babylon modified the religious ideas of the Jews in any important particular. For fear was upon them. Or, \"though fear was upon them.\" Notwithstanding their fear of the surrounding nations, they set up the altar. We must remember that their neighbours were not Persians, but descendants of various idolatrous nations - Hamathites, Babylonians, Susianians, Elamites, Cuthaeans, etc. - bitterly opposed to anything like a pure spiritual religion (see 2 Kings 17:24; Ezra 4:9, 10). Though the exiles had permission from Cyrus to raise up not only their altar, but their temple, it was not at all certain that his nominal subjects would passively submit. It was as if a modern Turkish Sultan should decree the erection of a Christian altar and a grand Christian cathedral at Kerbela or Bussorah, towards the verge of his empire. There would be great danger in acting on such a decree. Burnt offerings morning and evening. So the law required (see Exodus 29:38, 39; Numbers 28:3, 4). CELEBRATION OF THE FEAST OF TABERNACLES (ver. 4). Emboldened by their successful restoration of the altar of burnt sacrifice, Zerubbabel and Jeshua allowed the people to gather themselves together and celebrate the autumnal festival, though they can scarcely have made it on this occasion a \"feast of ingathering.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzra3:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThey kept also the feast of tabernacles, as it is written, and offered the daily burnt offerings by number, according to the custom, as the duty of every day required;VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 4. - As it is written. According to the mode of celebration prescribed in the law; i.e. for seven consecutive days, from the fifteenth to the twenty-second of Tisri, with burnt offerings every day, and a holy convocation on the first day and the last, and a \"dwelling in tents\" during the whole period (see Leviticus 23:31-42). The daily burnt offerings by number, according to the custom. The offerings for each day of the festival are carefully laid down in Numbers 29:13-38. We must understand that all the particulars there enjoined were carefully observed. PERMANENT ESTABLISHMENT OF THE DAILY SACRIFICE, THE SET FEASTS, AND THE OFFERING OF FREE-WILL OFFERINGS (vers. 5, 6). Having set up the altar, and celebrated the particular festival which the revolving year happened to have brought round, and which it would have been wrong to neglect, the exiles re-established permanently three things: -NEWLINENEWLINE1. The daily sacrifice;NEWLINENEWLINE2. The celebration of the new moons and other regular feasts; andNEWLINENEWLINE3. The practice of allowing the people to bring offerings whenever they pleased, to be offered on the great altar by the priest or priests in attendance.NEWLINENEWLINEThe first of these was for atonement; the second for public thanksgiving and acknowledgment of God's mercies; the third for private devotion, the payment of vows, and the like.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzra3:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd afterward offered the continual burnt offering, both of the new moons, and of all the set feasts of the LORD that were consecrated, and of every one that willingly offered a freewill offering unto the LORD.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 5. - The continual burnt offering. This is beyond a doubt the daily morning and evening sacrifice, called \"the continual burnt offering\" in Exodus 29:42 and Numbers 28:3-6. The clause is not modified by the succeeding words, which are additional, not exegetical, and which should not be translated, as in the A. V., both of the new moons, but, \"and those of the new moons.\" The returned exiles kept henceforth regularly both the daily morning and evening sacrifice, and also that appointed for the new moons (Numbers 28:11-15), and those appointed for the other \"set feasts,\"such as the passover and the feast of Pentecost. And of every one that willingly offered. Nor was this all. The practice was resumed of sacrificing on the great altar at any time any free-will offerings that individual Israelites might bring (see Leviticus 1, 2, 3, etc.). Thus provision was made for all that was most essential in the ritual of religion, while the temple itself still remained unbuilt (see ver. 6). PREPARATION OF MATERIALS FOR THE REBUILDING OF THE TEMPLE (ver. 7). When the restoration of religion had pro-greased thus far, the civil and ecclesiastical rulers turned their attention to that object which had been specially mentioned in the \"decree of Cyrus\" (Ezra 1:2, 3), the rebuilding of the temple. And, first of all, it was necessary to collect building materials, wood and stone, which were the chief materials of the first temple, and which Cyrus had particularized in a supplementary decree (Ezra 6:4) as those to be employed in the construction of the second.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzra3:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFrom the first day of the seventh month began they to offer burnt offerings unto the LORD. But the foundation of the temple of the LORD was not yet laid.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzra3:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThey gave money also unto the masons, and to the carpenters; and meat, and drink, and oil, unto them of Zidon, and to them of Tyre, to bring cedar trees from Lebanon to the sea of Joppa, according to the grant that they had of Cyrus king of Persia.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 7. - They gave money also unto the masons. The exiles had no doubt been employed by the Babylonian monarchs to a large extent in building, as their ancestors had been during their sojourn in Egypt (Exodus 1:2). Consequently, among those who returned there were many masons and carpenters. These were now set to work by Zerubbabel, and received their wages in money. And meat, and drink, and oil, unto them of Zidon, and to them of Tyre. The Phoenicians, on the other hand, received their wages in kind. As Phoenicia was a narrow strip of country, and grew but little corn, it had always to depend mainly for its supplies of food on its neighbours, and generally drew the greater part from Palestine (see Acts 12:20). Hiram had furnished materials to Solomon for the first temple on condition of receiving wheat, barley, wine, and oil (2 Chronicles 2:15). Zerubbabel made a similar arrangement at the present time with the Tyrians and Sidonians. To bring cedar trees from Lebanon to the sea of Joppa. Having cut the timber in the mountains, the Phoenicians conveyed it to the coast, perhaps sometimes letting it pass down the rivers, and, collecting it on the coast into large rafts or \"flotes\" (2 Chronicles 2:16), took these by sea to the roadstead of Joppa (Jaffa). Hence it was conveyed by land a distance of thirty-five miles to Jerusalem. Lebanon cedar was in great request in the East, and appears to have been cut and carried off both by the Egyptians and the Assyrians. The forests must in the ancient times have been far more extensive than at present. According to the grant that they had of Cyrus. A special grant of Phoenician timber, made by Cyrus, seems to be intended. Though Cyrus had not conquered Phoenicia ('Herod.,' 3:34), he might regard his conquest of Babylon as involving the submission of what had for some time been a Babylonian dependency.NEWLINENEWLINECHAPTER 3:8-13NEWLINENEWLINE§ 3. REBUILDING OF THE TEMPLE AND OPPOSITION MADE TO IT. LAYING OF THE FOUNDATION OF THE TEMPLE AND CEREMONIAL ON THE OCCASION (vers. 8-13). Seven months were occupied with preparations. The winter was past, and the spring had arrived. It was the second month, Zif, the month of \"blossom,\" corresponding to our May - the same month in which Solomon had laid the foundation of the first temple (1 Kings 6:1) - when Zerubbabel judged that the time had come for commencing the foundation of the second. The correspondence of the month was no doubt intentional, like the correspondence of the foundations of the altar (ver. 3), and was to mark that all was to be as before, that nothing was to be wantonly changed. Zerubbabel and Jeshua presided; but to Zerubbabel is assigned the chief part in the work. \"The hands of Zerubbabel have laid the foundation of this house\" are the words of God himself to Zechariah (Zechariah 4:9). It was arranged that the work should commence with a religious ceremonial, natural piety here suggesting what was not recorded of the \"first house,\" though it may have occurred and not have been put on record. The ceremonial consisted chiefly of praise, and was accompanied with sacred music, according to the pattern set by David and Solomon in their sacred processions and ceremonies (1 Chronicles 15:19, 24; 1 Chronicles 16:5; 2 Chronicles 5:12, etc.). Their special parts in it were assigned beforehand to the priests, the Levites, and the people.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzra3:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTNow in the second year of their coming unto the house of God at Jerusalem, in the second month, began Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, and Jeshua the son of Jozadak, and the remnant of their brethren the priests and the Levites, and all they that were come out of the captivity unto Jerusalem; and appointed the Levites, from twenty years old and upward, to set forward the work of the house of the LORD.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 8. - In the second year. In B.C. 537, the second year of Cyrus in Babylon, which was also the second year of their coming (i.e. after their coming) to the (ruined) house of God (Ezra 2:68), began Zerubbabel, and the others, and appointed the Levites. Small as the number of the Levites who returned with Zerubbabel was, to them especially was intrusted the work of the house of the Lord, i.e. the superintendence of the workmen employed to rebuild it (see ver. 9).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzra3:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen stood Jeshua with his sons and his brethren, Kadmiel and his sons, the sons of Judah, together, to set forward the workmen in the house of God: the sons of Henadad, with their sons and their brethren the Levites.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 9. - Jeshua here is the head of the Levitical family mentioned in ch. 2:40 as \"the children of Jeshua,\" and Kadmiel is the head of the other family. Judah represents the \"Hodaviah\" of that place, and is probably a corrupt reading, as Nehemiah (Nehemiah 7:43) has \"Hodevah.\" The sons of Henadad, who are here united with the Jeshuites and Kadmielites, constitute a third Levitical family, which (as the text stands) was also engaged in superintending the work. But there is some reason to suspect that the passage is an unauthorized addition to the true text.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzra3:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd when the builders laid the foundation of the temple of the LORD, they set the priests in their apparel with trumpets, and the Levites the sons of Asaph with cymbals, to praise the LORD, after the ordinance of David king of Israel.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 10. - When the builders (Zerubbabel and Jeshua) laid the foundation of the temple, they set the priests in their apparel - the rich apparel, designed \"for glory and for beauty,\" which the law required (Exodus 28:40; Exodus 40:27-29), and which the people had recently provided (Ezra 2:69). With trumpets. To blow with trumpets was always the duty of the priests (Numbers 10:8; Numbers 31:6; Joshua 6:4; 1 Chronicles 15:24; 1 Chronicles 16:6; 2 Chronicles 5:12), to praise God with cymbals the task of the Levites (1 Chronicles 15:16, 19; 1 Chronicles 16:5; 2 Chronicles 5:12, 13; 2 Chronicles 29:25, etc.), perhaps because the trumpet was regarded as the instrument of greater dignity. After the ordinance of David. David's ordinance on the subject is first expressed briefly in 1 Chronicles 15:16; afterwards, more fully, in vers. 17-21 of the same chapter. The musical service of Zerubbabel fell short of the \"ordinance of David,\" since it comprised neither psalteries nor harps, which were an essential part of David's system. Apparently, the musical skill of the Levites had declined under the depressing circumstances of the captivity (see Psalm 137:2).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzra3:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd they sang together by course in praising and giving thanks unto the LORD; because he is good, for his mercy endureth for ever toward Israel. And all the people shouted with a great shout, when they praised the LORD, because the foundation of the house of the LORD was laid.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 11. - They sang together by course. Literally, \"They replied (to each other),\" or sang antiphonically; the burthen of their song being, that God was good, and his mercy towards Israel everlasting (comp. 2 Chronicles 5:13; 2 Chronicles 7:3, where the Levites of Solomon's time are reported to have praised God similarly). All the people shouted with a great shout. Shouting on occasions of secular joy and triumph has been practised by most nations, both in ancient and modern times. But religious shouting is less common. Still we hear of such shouting when the ark of the covenant was taken into the Israelite camp near Aphek (1 Samuel 4:5), and again when David solemnly brought it up from Kirjathjearim to Jerusalem (2 Samuel 6:15). Shouting appears also in the Psalms (Psalm 47:5) and in Zechariah (Zechariah 4:7) in connection with religion. It is always indicative of religious joy.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzra3:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut many of the priests and Levites and chief of the fathers, who were ancient men, that had seen the first house, when the foundation of this house was laid before their eyes, wept with a loud voice; and many shouted aloud for joy:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 12. - Many... who were ancient men, that had seen the first house. The old temple had not been destroyed so much as fifty years. Consequently, there would be many who could remember its grandeur and glory. These persons, when the foundation of the (new) house was laid before their eyes, wept with a loud voice. It was \"the day of small things\" (Zechariah 4:10). The new house, in comparison with the old one, was \"as nothing\" (Haggai 2:3). The difference was perhaps not so much in the dimensions (see note on Ezra 6:3) as in the size and quality of the foundation-stones (1 Kings 5:17), the excellence of the masonry, and the like. Solomon had employed the best workmen of one of the greatest of the Tyrian kings; Zerubbabel had only the arms of his own subjects to depend upon.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzra3:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTSo that the people could not discern the noise of the shout of joy from the noise of the weeping of the people: for the people shouted with a loud shout, and the noise was heard afar off.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 13. - The people could not discern the noise of the shout of joy from the noise of the weeping. One, it would seem, was as loud as the other; neither predominated. This, which would scarcely be possible among ourselves, was not unnatural in the East, where those who lament utter shrill cries, instead of weeping silently. Herodotus describes the lament of the Persians for a lost general as \"resounding throughout all Boeotia\" (Ezra 9:24).NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINE","Ezra.4":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzra4:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTNow when the adversaries of Judah and Benjamin heard that the children of the captivity builded the temple unto the LORD God of Israel;VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 1. - The adversaries. Notwithstanding the friendly guise in which they came, the historian sees from the first that the Samaritans are in reality \"adversaries,\" or \"persecutors\" (tsazey), identical in spirit with Sanballat and his followers, whom Nehemiah designates by the same word (Ezra 4:11).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzra4:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen they came to Zerubbabel, and to the chief of the fathers, and said unto them, Let us build with you: for we seek your God, as ye do; and we do sacrifice unto him since the days of Esarhaddon king of Assur, which brought us up hither.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 2. - We seek your God, as ye do. \"We seek your God\" was true; \"as ye do\" was not true. The Samaritans worshipped Jehovah, but not, as the Jews did, exclusively. \"They feared the Lord, and worshipped their own gods\" (2 Kings 17:33). Such worship dishonours Jehovah almost more than total neglect of him. Since the days of Esar-haddon. There was more than one colonisation of Central Palestine by the Assyrians. Sargon relates that he placed Arabians in the country; the writer of Kings tells us that it was occupied by Babylonians, Cuthaeans, Avites, Hamathites, and Sepharrites (2 Kings 17:24); the Samaritans themselves said that they were \"Dinaites, Apharsathchites, Tarpelites, Apharsites, Archevites, Babylonians, Susanchites, Debarites, and Elamites\" (infra, ver. 9). They attributed this last colonization to Esar-haddon. We may suspect that the second colonisation was by Sennacherib, who appears to have taken Babylon, Hamath, Sepharvaim, and Ivah or Avah (2 Kings 18:34). The result was that the Samaritans were a very mixed race.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzra4:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut Zerubbabel, and Jeshua, and the rest of the chief of the fathers of Israel, said unto them, Ye have nothing to do with us to build an house unto our God; but we ourselves together will build unto the LORD God of Israel, as king Cyrus the king of Persia hath commanded us.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 3. - Ye have nothing to do with us to build a house unto our God.

It is always possible at an Oriental court to bribe some of the royal favourites, and induce them to use their influence with the monarch for the furtherance, or hindrance, of any work that is being proceeded with in any part of the country. The Samaritans now had recourse to this system, and employed it with great success for a considerable period. All the days of Cyrus. i.e. \"all the remaining days,\" from B.C. 537 to B.C. 529, when Cyrus died, and was succeeded by his son Cambyses. Even until the reign of Darius. It is implied that the reign of Darius did not immediately follow on that of Cyrus. Profane history tells us of two intermediate kings, via, Cambyses, son of Cyrus, who reigned from B.C. 529 to B.C. 522, and Smerdis, or Bardes, a usurper, who occupied the throne for about ten months in the years B.C. 522, 521. Darius became king in this last-named year, but seems to have counted his reign from the date of the decease of Cambyses.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzra4:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd in the reign of Ahasuerus, in the beginning of his reign, wrote they unto him an accusation against the inhabitants of Judah and Jerusalem.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 6. - And in the reign of Ahasuerus. Some critics regard this Ahasuerus as identical with the Ahasuerus of Esther, who is generally allowed to be Xerxes, the son and successor of Darius Hystaspis, and the invader of Greece. In this case the Artaxerxes of the next verse is taken to be Artaxerxes Longimanus, and the entire passage, from ver. 6 to ver. 23 inclusively, is regarded as parenthetic, having reference to events which happened later than any of those recorded in ch. 6. But the evident nexus of vers. 23, 24 is fatal to this view, which has nothing in its favour beyond the sequence of the royal names, an uncertain argument in this instance, since we know that Persian kings had often more than one name. If on these grounds we reject the proposed identification, and regard the chapter as chronologically consecutive, Ahasuerus here must be explained as Cambyses, and the Artaxerxes of ver. 7 as Smerdis. This is the view most usually taken, and it seems to the present writer to present fewer difficulties than any other. In the beginning of his reign. As soon as ever a new king mounted the throne, fresh representations were made to him by the \"adversaries,\" lest the work should be recommenced. Wrote they an accusation. Comp. vers. 12-16, by which we see the sort of \"accusation that could be plausibly brought.NEWLINENEWLINECHAPTER 4:7-116.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzra4:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd in the days of Artaxerxes wrote Bishlam, Mithredath, Tabeel, and the rest of their companions, unto Artaxerxes king of Persia; and the writing of the letter was written in the Syrian tongue, and interpreted in the Syrian tongue.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 7. - And in the days of Artaxerxes. See the comment on ver. 6. If Artaxerxes be the Pseudo-Smerdis, we can readily understand why an application was not made to him at once, and how it came about that the Jews recommenced their building, as they appear from vers. 12, 13 to have done. The Pseudo-Smerdis was a usurper; his reign was a time of partial anarchy; in a distant part of the empire it would not be known for a while who was king. Men would be thrown on themselves, and would do as it seemed good in their own eyes. Later, there may have been some doubt whether a king, who was known to be a religious reformer, would follow the policy of his predecessor with respect to the Jews, or reverse it. Hence a delay, and then a more formal application than before for a positive decree to stop the building (see ver. 21). The rest of their companions. Literally, of their companies - the abstract for the concrete. The writing of the letter was written in the Syrian tongue. Rather, \"in the Syrian fashion,\" i.e. in Syriac characters. And interpreted in the Syrian tongue. Or \"translated into the Syriac language.\" The character and the words were alike Syriac (comp. 2 Kings 18:26). Ezra gives the letter in Chaldee.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzra4:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTRehum the chancellor and Shimshai the scribe wrote a letter against Jerusalem to Artaxerxes the king in this sort:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 8. - Rehum the chancellor. Literally, \"the lord of judgment.\" It may be conjectured that Rehum was the sub-satrap (ὑποσατράπης, Xen.), of the province of Samaria. And Shimshai the scribe. Or \"secretary.\" Herodotus tells us that in every Persian province the governor had a secretary attached to him, who was appointed by the crown, and acted as a check upon his nominal master (Herod., 3:128). The position assigned to Shim-shai in this chapter (see especially vers. 9, 17, 23) is such as might be expected under these circumstances.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzra4:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen wrote Rehum the chancellor, and Shimshai the scribe, and the rest of their companions; the Dinaites, the Apharsathchites, the Tarpelites, the Apharsites, the Archevites, the Babylonians, the Susanchites, the Dehavites, and the Elamites,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 9. - The Dinaites, etc. It is curious that the Samaritans, instead of using a general appellation, describe themselves under the names of the various nations and cities which had furnished the colonists of whom they were the descendants. It would seem that they were not yet, in the time of the Pseudo-Smerdis, amalgamated into a single people. From the list of names we may gather that the colonists of Esar-haddon's time had been derived chiefly from Southern Babylonia and the adjacent regions of Susiana, Persia, and Elymais. The Babylonians, Susanchites, and Elamites speak for themselves, and require no explanation. The Archevites are the people of Ereeh or Orchoe (now Warka), a city to the south-east of Babylon. The Apharsites are no doubt Persians; the Dehavites, Dai or Dahae, a tribe located in Persia Proper ('Herod.,' 1:125). If uncertainty attaches to any of the names, it is to two only - the Dinaites and the Tarpelites. Of these, the Dinaites are probably the people of Dayan, a country bordering on Cilicia, whose inhabitants are often mentioned by the Assyrian monarchs. The Tarpelites have been regarded as the people of Tripolis; but it is improbable that that city had as yet received its Greek name. Perhaps they are the Tuplai, or people of Tubal, mentioned in Scripture and the Assyrian inscriptions, the letter r being a euphonic addition, as in Darmesek for Dammesek sharbith for shebeth, and the like.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzra4:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the rest of the nations whom the great and noble Asnappar brought over, and set in the cities of Samaria, and the rest that are on this side the river, and at such a time.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 10. - The rest of the nations whom the great and noble Asnapper brought over. Nothing more is known of \"the great and noble Asnapper,\" who is here mentioned as bringing the colonists and setting them in the cities of Samaria. We must suppose him to have been an officer employed by Esar-haddon on this service. The name is Assyrian in form, and may have meant \"Asshur pursues.\" The rest that are on this side the river. Rather, \"across the river.\" As Romans in North Italy, writing to Rome, would have spoken of themselves as \"Transpadani,\" so Persian subjects, writing to Susa from the west of the Jordan, speak of theft country as \"across the Jordan.\" And at such a time. Rather, \"and so forth.\" This and the preceding verse set forth the address of Rehum's letter. The whole address not being given, the writer ends with the phrase uk'eneth, which means \"and so forth,\" or \"et cetera\" (comp. Ezra 7:12).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzra4:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThis is the copy of the letter that they sent unto him, even unto Artaxerxes the king; Thy servants the men on this side the river, and at such a time.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 11. - This is the copy of the letter. The address having been given, the writer now proceeds to the contents of the letter. Thy servants the men on this side the river, etc. This was a sort of heading inside the letter - a repetition in brief of the address.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzra4:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBe it known unto the king, that the Jews which came up from thee to us are come unto Jerusalem, building the rebellious and the bad city, and have set up the walls thereof, and joined the foundations.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 12. - The Jews which came up from thee. i.e. from the central provinces - from that part of the empire where thou dwellest. To us. To our part of the world - to Palestine. Are... building the rebellious and the bad city. The ground of this accusation must be sought in the various revolts of the Jews from the Babylonians recorded in 2 Kings 24, 25. There had been one, or perhaps two, previous revolts from Assyria (2 Kings 18:7; 2 Chronicles 33:11); but of these the Samaritans probably knew nothing. They would, however, be likely to know that before Nebuchadnezzar took the extreme measure of removing the Jews from their own land to Babylon, they had rebelled against him three several times - once under Jehoiakim (2 Kings 24:1), once under his son Jehoiachin (ibid. vers. 9, 10), and once under Zedekiah, the last king (ibid. ver. 20). Thus they had a basis of truth on which to ground their charge that Jerusalem was \"the rebellious and the bad city.\" And have set up the walls thereof. It appears very clearly from the book of Nehemiah that the walls of Jerusalem were not restored till his time, seventy-five years after this. The Samaritans, however, would naturally exaggerate, and call the rebuilding of the temple, and of a certain number of dwelling-houses, a fortifying of the place. The exaggeration, however, is not so great in the Chaldee text as in the Authorized Version. What is said seems to be, that \"they are setting up the walls and joining the foundations.\" That the work was far from complete is admitted in the next verse. We may doubt whether it was really begun.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzra4:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBe it known now unto the king, that, if this city be builded, and the walls set up again, then will they not pay toll, tribute, and custom, and so thou shalt endamage the revenue of the kings.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 13. - Then will they not pay toll, tribute, and custom. This was plausible reasoning. In Greece, if a subject city set to work to fortify itself, rebellion was immediately anticipated, not unfairly. But the circumstances of the Persian empire were different. In the remoter parts of that empire the central government was weak, and disorders frequently occurred. A city might need fortifications to protect it against its immediate neighbours, when it had not the slightest intention of asserting independence. Judging from the later history, which shows no revolt of the Jews against Persia, we may say that the accusation now alleged was unfounded, though perhaps it was not made in bad faith. Toll, tribute, and custom represent the chief heads of Persian taxation, which, however, did not include \"custom\" in our sense of the word. The three terms used by the Samaritans really represent, respectively, \"tribute,\" or the money payment required from each province, \"provision,\" or the payment in kind equally required (Herod., 1:192; 3:91), and \"toll,\" or contributions from those who made use of the Persian highways. According to the Samaritans, none of these would be paid by the Jews if Jerusalem was once fortified. And so thou shalt endamage the revenue. The general meaning is given correctly enough by this rendering, but \"revenue\" is not expressly mentioned. Aphthom, the word so translated, means really \"at length,\" \"at last.\" Translate, \"And so at last thou shalt endamage the kings.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzra4:14VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTNow because we have maintenance from the king's palace, and it was not meet for us to see the king's dishonour, therefore have we sent and certified the king;VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 14. - We have maintenance from the king's palace. The marginal rendering is better, and shows the true sense. \"Eating a man's salt\" in the East is deriving one's subsistence from him. The man who eats another's salt is bound to look after his interests. It was not meet for us to see the king's dishonour. Rather, \"the king's detriment or loss\" - it was not meet for us to stand by tamely and see the king stript of his due.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzra4:15VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThat search may be made in the book of the records of thy fathers: so shalt thou find in the book of the records, and know that this city is a rebellious city, and hurtful unto kings and provinces, and that they have moved sedition within the same of old time: for which cause was this city destroyed.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 15. - That search may be made in the book of the records of thy fathers. It was the practice at the Persian court to register all important events in a book, which from time to time was read to the kings (Esther 2:23; Esther 6:1). The Samaritans suggest a consultation of this book, which would at any rate contain their own previous accusations against Jerusalem (supra, vers. 5, 6), and might make some mention of the revolts from Babylon (see the comment on ver. 12). For which cause was this city destroyed. This was the great fact on which the Samaritans relied. Nebuchadnezzar had only destroyed Jerusalem in consequence of repeated rebellions. True; but no sufficient indication that there would be revolt from Persia, which was anti-idolatrous, and had proved herself so true a friend to the Jews.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzra4:16VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWe certify the king that, if this city be builded again, and the walls thereof set up, by this means thou shalt have no portion on this side the river.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 16. - Thou shalt have no portion on this side the river. It is not quite clear whether the river intended here and in ver. 10 is the Euphrates or the Jordan. Generally in the Old Testament hannahar means the Euphrates, but the exaggeration is gross if that river was intended here. Only twice in their history had the Israelites advanced their frontier as far as that stream - under Solomon (1 Kings 4:21) and under Menahem (2 Kings 15:16); in their present depressed condition it was absurd to imagine that they could rival those early glories. But jealousy does not stop to weigh the reasonableness of its accusations.NEWLINENEWLINECHAPTER 4:17-24.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzra4:17VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen sent the king an answer unto Rehum the chancellor, and to Shimshai the scribe, and to the rest of their companions that dwell in Samaria, and unto the rest beyond the river, Peace, and at such a time.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 17. - Then sent the king an answer. The complaint made was of such importance that an answer was returned without delay. It was addressed both to Rehum and Shimshai, since they were independent authorities.. Peace, and at such a time. \"Peace\" (sheldm) is the ordinary Oriental salutation. The other word, uk'eth, is taken by our translators to refer to the date; but it really means, like uk'eneth (ver. 10), \"and so forth,\" or \"et cetera.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzra4:18VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe letter which ye sent unto us hath been plainly read before me.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 18. - The letter hath been plainly read before me.

(Compare Esther 6:1.)NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzra4:19VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd I commanded, and search hath been made, and it is found that this city of old time hath made insurrection against kings, and that rebellion and sedition have been made therein.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 19. - I commanded, and search has been made. The Pseudo-Smerdis, who was a fanatical adherent of Magism, which disallowed temples altogether (Herod., 1:130), and who had already destroyed the temples of Ormuzd in Persia ('Behistun Ins.,' col. 1. par. 14, 5), was naturally willing enough to do as the Samaritans desired, and stop the restoration of the Jewish temple. Accordingly, he had a search made among the state records, and found, as they had expected he would, evidence of insurrections on the part of the Jews against the foreign countries to which they had been subject, as Assyria (2 Kings 18:7) and Babylon (ibid. 24:1; Jeremiah 52:3), and also proof of the formidable power possessed by certain Jewish or Israelite kings; upon which he thought himself justified in complying with the Samaritan request, and ordering the work that was going on at Jerusalem to cease (see ver. 21).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzra4:20VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThere have been mighty kings also over Jerusalem, which have ruled over all countries beyond the river; and toll, tribute, and custom, was paid unto them.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 20. - Mighty kings. David and Solomon best answer to this description, possessing as they did a kingdom which extended from the Euphrates to the borders of Egypt (1 Kings 4:21, 24), and drawing tribute from the various petty princes or chiefs of the nations dwelling within those limits (2 Samuel 8:6-12; 1 Kings 10:14, 25). Josiah had perhaps, more recently, possessed an almost equally extensive sway.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzra4:21VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTGive ye now commandment to cause these men to cease, and that this city be not builded, until another commandment shall be given from me.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 21. - Until another commandment shall be given. It can scarcely be supposed that the Pseudo-Smerdis had any intention of issuing \"another commandment;\" but, since \"the laws of the Medes and Persians,\" as a general rule, \"altered not\" (Esther 1:19; Daniel 6:15), it may well be that the clause before us was one inserted as a matter of form in most decrees, to prevent them from being irrevocable.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzra4:22VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTTake heed now that ye fail not to do this: why should damage grow to the hurt of the kings?VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzra4:23VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTNow when the copy of king Artaxerxes' letter was read before Rehum, and Shimshai the scribe, and their companions, they went up in haste to Jerusalem unto the Jews, and made them to cease by force and power.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 23. - They went up in haste. The \"adversaries\" lost no time. Having obtained the decree which forbad further building, they proceeded with it to Jerusalem, and by a display of force compelled the Jews to submission. No doubt resistance might have been made, but resistance would have been rebellion.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzra4:24VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen ceased the work of the house of God which is at Jerusalem. So it ceased unto the second year of the reign of Darius king of Persia.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 24. - Then ceased the work... until the second year of the reign of Darius. The interval of compelled inaction was not long. The Pseudo-Smerdis reigned, at the utmost, ten months; after which a revolution occurred, and the throne was occupied by Darius, the son of Hystaspes. If the work was resumed early in this monarch's second year, the entire period of suspension cannot have much exceeded a year and a half. King of Persia. There is probably no intention of distinguishing the Darius of this book from \"Darius the Mede\" (Daniel 5:31; Daniel 6:1). \"King of Persia\" is appended to his name merely out of respect and honor, as it is to the names of Cyrus (Daniel 1:1, 2, 8), Artaxerxes I. (Daniel 4:7), and Artaxerxes II. (Daniel 6:14). Such a superfluous attachment to his name of the style and title of a monarch is common throughout the Old Testament, and generally marks a distinct intention to do the individual honour (see Genesis 41:46; 1 Kings 3:1; 1 Kings 9:11, 16; 1 Kings 11:18; 2 Chronicles 36:22, etc.).NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINE","Ezra.5":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzra5:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen the prophets, Haggai the prophet, and Zechariah the son of Iddo, prophesied unto the Jews that were in Judah and Jerusalem in the name of the God of Israel, even unto them.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 1. - Zechariah the son of Iddo. Really the grandson (Zechariah 1:1). But Bere-chiah, his father, probably died while he was a child, and, being brought up by Iddo, he was called \"the son of Iddo. Prophesied unto the Jews. The addresses of Haggai and Zechariah were only occasionally \"prophetic,\" as we now commonly understand the word. But in the language of the Biblical writers all religious teaching is \"prophesying,\" and Ezra here refers mainly to the exhortations addressed to the Jews by Zechariah and Haggai.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzra5:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen rose up Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, and Jeshua the son of Jozadak, and began to build the house of God which is at Jerusalem: and with them were the prophets of God helping them.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 2. - Then rose up Zerubbabel... and Jeshua. Haggai's preaching was especially addressed to these two leaders (Haggai 1:1), and their spirit was especially \"stirred up\" (ibid. ver. 14) by his preaching. The prophets of God - Haggai and Zechariah - were with them, throughout their work, helping them; and that in various ways.NEWLINENEWLINE1.

By these and similar means the two prophets aroused a spirit of enthusiasm, which caused the work to make rapid progress, and was an invaluable assistance.NEWLINENEWLINECHAPTER 5:3-17 RENEWAL OF OPPOSITION ON THE PART OF THE NEIGHBOURING HEATHEN. LETTER WRITTEN BY THEM AND SENT TO DARIUS (vers. 3-17). Once more opposition showed itself. Tatnai, a high officer, called \"governor on this side the river\" (ver. 3), perhaps satrap of Syria, and Shethar-boznai, or Sitrabarzanes, a Persian noble probably, at this time took the lead, and learning that the building was making progress, came in person to Jerusalem, and demanded to know by what authority the temple and city were being restored. Zerubbabel seems to have answered, \"By the authority of a decree of Cyrus, issued in the year that he became king of Babylon\" (ver. 13); whereupon a second question was asked, \"What are the names of the men responsible for carrying on the work?\" Zerubbabel answered that he was alone responsible, giving his name as Sheshbazzar, and declaring himself to be acting under a commission received from Cyrus (ver. 15), and never revoked. Thereupon Tatnai and Shethar-boznai seem to have proposed a cessation of the building until reference could be made to Darius and his pleasure learnt (ver. 5); but Zerubbabel declined to agree to this, and the work proceeded without intermission (ibid.). Meanwhile, a letter was written to Darius, not unfairly stating the case, and suggesting that the state archives should be searched for the decree ascribed to Cyrus, that it might be seen what exactly it was that the decree sanctioned, and further that the king should expressly declare what his own pleasure was in the matter (ver. 17). This letter Tatnai, in his capacity of satrap, despatched to the court by special messenger, and so left the business to the decision of Darius and his counsellors, without further seeking to influence him. Remark the strong contrast between this despatch and that of the Samaritans. In the Samaritan letter private pique and enmity show themselves - Jerusalem is \"the rebellious and the bad city\" (Ezra 4:12), \"hurtful unto kings and provinces\" (ibid. ver. 15); its intention to revolt is assumed (ver. 13); the king is warned that his dominion and revenue are in danger (ver. 16); no hint is given of there having ever been any such document as the decree of Cyrus; no reference is made to Sheshbazzar or the royal commission that he had received; altogether, the case is stated as strongly as possible against the Jews, with great and manifest unfairness. Here, on the contrary, where the person who takes up the matter is the Persian governor, a dispassionate tone prevails; no charges are made; no abuse uttered; the letter is confined to a statement of facts and an inquiry; the Jews are allowed to give their own account of their proceedings, nearly half the letter being their statement of their own case (vers. 11-15); the decree of Cyrus is brought into prominence, asserted on the one hand, not denied on the other; that it should be searched for is suggested; and finally there is a simple request that the king will declare his will in respect of the building.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzra5:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAt the same time came to them Tatnai, governor on this side the river, and Shetharboznai, and their companions, and said thus unto them, Who hath commanded you to build this house, and to make up this wall?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 3. - Tatnai, governor on this side the river. The title given to Tatnai is the same which is assigned to Zerubbabel, both in Ezra 6:7 and in Haggai (Haggai 1:1, 14, etc.), viz., pechah, which is a somewhat vague term of authority, translated sometimes \"captain\" (1 Kings 20:24; Daniel 3:2, 3, etc.), sometimes \"deputy (Esther 8:9; Esther 9:3), but generally, as here, \"governor.\" The etymology is uncertain, but seems not to be Semitic (see Pusey's 'Daniel,' pp. 570-572). The respective rank of Tatnai and Zerub-babel is indicated, not by this term, but by what follows it. Tatnai was pechah \"beyond the river,\" i.e. governor of the whole tract west of the Euphrates; Zerubbabel was pechah of Judah only. A Greek writer would have called the one \"satrap of Syria,\" the other \"sub-satrap of Judaea.\" It was the duty of Tatuai to watch the proceedings of his sub-satraps.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzra5:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen said we unto them after this manner, What are the names of the men that make this building?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 4. - Then said we unto them. It is impossible that the existing text can be sound here. Ezra must have written, \"Then said they to them.\" Tatnai and Shethar-boznai followed up their first question by a second, \"What are the names of the men that make this building?\" (comp. below, vers. 9, 10).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzra5:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut the eye of their God was upon the elders of the Jews, that they could not cause them to cease, till the matter came to Darius: and then they returned answer by letter concerning this matter.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 5. - The eye of their God was upon the elders. \"The eyes of the Lord are upon the righteous\" (Psalm 34:15) with a jealous watchfulness, which never for a moment slackens. \"He withdraweth not his eyes from them\" (Job 36:7). Nothing happens to them that he does not know and allow. At this time the elders, who pre-aided over the workmen employed in the restoration, were a special subject of God's watchful care, so that those who would fain have hindered them could not. The work of rebuilding went on uninterruptedly during the whole time that the messengers were away.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzra5:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe copy of the letter that Tatnai, governor on this side the river, and Shetharboznai, and his companions the Apharsachites, which were on this side the river, sent unto Darius the king:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 6. - The Apharsachites recall the \"Apharsites\" and the \"Apharsathchites\" of Ezra 4:9. Possibly all the three forms are provincial variants of the more correct Parsaya, which appears in Daniel (Daniel 6:28) as the Chaldaean equivalent of \"Persian.\" Here the Apharsachite \"companions\" of Tatnai and Shethar-boznai are perhaps the actual Persians who formed their body-guard and their train.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzra5:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThey sent a letter unto him, wherein was written thus; Unto Darius the king, all peace.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzra5:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBe it known unto the king, that we went into the province of Judea, to the house of the great God, which is builded with great stones, and timber is laid in the walls, and this work goeth fast on, and prospereth in their hands.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 8. - We went into the province of Judaea. It has been supposed (Pusey's 'Daniel,' p. 571), on the strength of a doubtful passage in Nehemiah (Nehemiah 3:7), that Tatnai ordinarily resided at Jernsalem. But this expression indicates the contrary. Most probably the satrap of Syria held his court at Damascus. The house of the great God is a remarkable expression in the mouth of a heathen. It has some parallels, e.g. the expressions of Cyrus in Ezra 1:2, 3, and of Nebuchadnezzar in Daniel 2:47 and Daniel 3:29; but they were persons who had been brought to the knowledge that Jehovah was the one true God, under very peculiar and miraculous circumstances. Tatnai, on the other hand, represents the mere ordinary Persian official; and his acknowledgment of the God of the Jews as \"the great God\" must be held to indicate the general belief of the Persians on the subject (see the comment on Ezra 1:2). Which is builded. Rather, \"being builded.\" With great stones. Literally, \"stones of rolling,\" which is commonly explained as stones so large that they had to be rolled along the ground. But the squared stones used in building neither were, nor could be, rolled; they are always represented as dragged, generally on a rough sledge. And it is not at all probable that in the \"day of small things\" (Zechariah 4:10) the Jews were building with very large stones. The LXX. translate \"choice stones;\" the Vulgate \"unpolished\" or \"rough stone.\" Some of the Jewish expositors suggest \"marble.\" And timber is laid. A good deal of timber had been employed in the old temple, but chiefly for the floors of chambers (1 Kings 6:10), for the internal lining of the walls (ibid. vers. 9, 15), and probably for the roofing. In the new temple, timber seems to have been employed also as the main material of the party-walls. Here again we have a trace of the economy necessary in the \"day of small things.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzra5:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen asked we those elders, and said unto them thus, Who commanded you to build this house, and to make up these walls?VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzra5:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWe asked their names also, to certify thee, that we might write the names of the men that were the chief of them.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzra5:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd thus they returned us answer, saying, We are the servants of the God of heaven and earth, and build the house that was builded these many years ago, which a great king of Israel builded and set up.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 11. - We are the servants of the God of heaven and earth. Instead of doing as they were requested, and giving in a long list of names and titles of office, the elders merge their individuality in this general phrase; as though they would say, \"As individuals, we are nothing; as men of mark in our nation, we are nothing; what we do, we do simply as servants of God, directed by him (Haggai 1:8), bound to obey him, answerable only to him for our conduct.\" They speak of God as \"the God of heaven and earth\" - a very rare title - partly in humble acknowledgment of his universal and absolute dominion, as Christians speak when they call God \"the Maker of heaven and earth;\" partly to impress favourably those to whom they speak, persons accustomed to regard God primarily as the Being who \"gave mankind earth and heaven\" (Rawlinson's 'Cuneiform Inscriptions of Persia,' vol. 1. pp. 285, 291, 319, 324, etc.). And build. That is \"rebuild.\" The house that was builded these many years ago. The old house, begun more than 400, finished nearly 400 years previously, and only just beginning to rise again from its ruins, after lying waste for nearly seventy years. Which a great king of Israel builded and set up. Solomon, the greatest of the Jewish monarchs, if we consider the extent and prosperity of his kingdom, and the position that it occupied among the other kingdoms of the earth - a \"great king\" under whatever aspect we view him, though one who sowed the seeds of that corruption which ultimately sapped the national life, and provoked God to bring the monarchy to an end.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzra5:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut after that our fathers had provoked the God of heaven unto wrath, he gave them into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon, the Chaldean, who destroyed this house, and carried the people away into Babylon.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 12. - Our fathers provoked the God of heaven unto wrath. Mainly by their long series of idolatries, with the moral abominations that those idolatries involved - the sacrifice of children by their own parents, the licentious rites belonging to the worship of Baal, and the unmentionable horrors practised by the devotees of the Dea Syra. For centuries, with only short and rare intervals, \"the chief of the priests, and the people, had transgressed very much after all the abominations of the heathen,\" and had even \"polluted the house of the Lord which he had hallowed in Jerusalem\" (2 Chronicles 36:14). Therefore, he gave them into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon. He punished, as he always does, national apostasy with national destruction. Making an idolatrous people, but a less guilty one, his sword, he cut off Judah, as he had previously cut off Israel, causing the national life to cease, and even removing the bulk of the people into a distant country. Not by his own power or might did Nebuchadnezzar prevail. God could have delivered the Jews from him as easily as he had delivered them in former days from Jabin (Judges 4:2-24), and from Zerah (2 Chronicles 14:11-15), and from Sennacherib (2 Kings 19:20-36). But he was otherwise minded; he \"gave them into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar\" (comp. 2 Chronicles 36:17). He divided their counsels, paralysed their resistance, caused Pharaoh Hophra to desert their cause (2 Kings 24:7), and left them helpless and unprotected. Nebuchadnczzar was his instrument to chastise his guilty people, and in pursuing his own ends merely worked out the purposes of the Almighty.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzra5:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut in the first year of Cyrus the king of Babylon the same king Cyrus made a decree to build this house of God.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 13. - In the first year of Cyrus the king of Babylon. Recent discoveries of contract tablets have shown that at Babylon Cyrus bore the title of \"king of Babylon\" from the date of his conquest of the city. The same title was passed on to his successors, Cambyses, Darius, etc. Hence we find Artaxerxes Longimanus called \"king of Babylon\" by Nehemiah (Nehemiah 13:6).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzra5:14VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the vessels also of gold and silver of the house of God, which Nebuchadnezzar took out of the temple that was in Jerusalem, and brought them into the temple of Babylon, those did Cyrus the king take out of the temple of Babylon, and they were delivered unto one, whose name was Sheshbazzar, whom he had made governor;VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 14. - The vessels also of gold and silver. See Ezra 1:7-11. On the great importance attached to these vessels, see the comment on Ezra 1:7. So long as they remained at Babylon they were a tangible evidence of the conquest, a glory to the Babylonians, and a disgrace to the Jews. Their retention was a perpetual desecration. Their restoration by Cyrus was an act at once of piety and of kindliness. On the temple of Babylon, out of which Cyrus took them, see the comment on Ezra 1:7.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzra5:15VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd said unto him, Take these vessels, go, carry them into the temple that is in Jerusalem, and let the house of God be builded in his place.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 15. - Let the house of God be builded in his place. i.e. upon the old holy site - the place where Abraham offered his son Isaac, in a figure (Hebrews 11:17-19), where the angel stood and stayed the pestilence in David s time (2 Samuel 24:16-18), and where \"the glory of the Lord descended and filled the house\" under Solomon (2 Chronicles 7:1).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzra5:16VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen came the same Sheshbazzar, and laid the foundation of the house of God which is in Jerusalem: and since that time even until now hath it been in building, and yet it is not finished.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 16. - Since that time even until now hath it been in building. It is not quite clear whether these words are part of the answer given by the Jews to Tatnai, which he reports to Darius (see ver. 11), or Tatnai's own statement of what he believes to have been the fact. Perhaps the latter view is the more probable; and we may suppose Tatnai not to have been aware that from the second year of Cyrus to the commencement of the reign of Smerdis, and again during the latter part of this reign and the first eighteen months of the reign of Darius, the work had been suspended.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzra5:17VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTNow therefore, if it seem good to the king, let there be search made in the king's treasure house, which is there at Babylon, whether it be so, that a decree was made of Cyrus the king to build this house of God at Jerusalem, and let the king send his pleasure to us concerning this matter.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 17. - Let there be search made in the king's treasure house. The Vulgate has \"in the king's library;\" and this, though not the literal rendering, is probably what was intended by Tatuai. Libraries or record chambers were attached to the royal residences under the old Assyrian and Babylonian kings; and the practice was no doubt continued by the Persians. Some of these record offices have been recently found, and their stores recovered. In the year 1850 Mr. Layard came upon the royal library of Asshur-bani-pal at Koyunjik, and obtained from it several hundreds of documents. More recently, in 1875-6, some Arab explorers happened upon a similar collection near Babylon, which yielded from 3000 to 4000 tablets ('Transactions of the Society of Biblical Archaeology,' vol. 6. pp. 4, 582). It is quite possible that the \"decree of Cyrus\" may still exist, and be one day recovered.NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINE","Ezra.6":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzra6:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen Darius the king made a decree, and search was made in the house of the rolls, where the treasures were laid up in Babylon.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 1. - Darius the king made a decree. Rather, \"gave an order\" (Vulg., praecepit). A \"decree\" would not be necessary. And search was made in the house of the rolls. Literally, \"in the house of the books,\" i.e. in the royal library, or record chamber. Where the treasures were laid up. The same repository was, apparently, used for documents of value and for the precious metals. An underground apartment is perhaps indicated by the word translated \"laid up,\" which means \"made to descend.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzra6:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd there was found at Achmetha, in the palace that is in the province of the Medes, a roll, and therein was a record thus written:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 2. - There was found at Achmetha. Not \"in a coffer,\" as our translators suggest in the margin, and as Aben Ezra and Jarchi interpret; but \"at Ecbatana,\" which is expressed letter for letter by the word used in the original, except that the final n is dropped. Compare for this omission the passage of Harran into Carrhae, and of Shu-shan into Susa. In the palace that is in the province of the Medes. The palace of Ecbatana was very famous. Herodotus says that it was built by Deioces, the first Median king, occupied the centre of the town, and was defended by seven circles of walls, one inside the other (1:98). Polybius states that the building covered an area 1420 yards in circumference, and consisted of a number of halls and cloistered courts, supported by wooden pillars, of cypress or of cedar, both of which were coated with a plating of gold or silver, and supported roofs sloped at an angle, consisting of silver plates instead of the customary tiling (5:27, 10). This grannd building was the residence of the old Median monarchs, and also of Cyrus and Cambyses. Darius built himself still more magnificent residences at Susa and Persepolis; but both he and the later Achaemenian monarchs continued to use the Median palace as a summer residence, and it maintained its celebrity till the close of the empire (see Arrian, 'Exp. Alex.,' 3:19). A roll. According to Ctesias ('Died. Sic.,' 2:32), the Persians employed parchment or vellum for the material of their records, not baked clay, like the Assyrians and Babylonians, or paper, like the Egyptians. Parchment would be a suitable material for rolls, and no doubt was anciently used chiefly in that shape. Therein was a record thus written. The decree would no doubt be written, primarily, in the Persian language and the Persian cuneiform character; but it may have been accompanied by a Chaldaean transcript, of which Ezra may have obtained a copy. Public documents were commonly set forth by the Persians in more than one language (see 'Herod.,' 4:87; and comp. the 'Inscriptions,' passim, which are almost universally either bilingual or trilingual).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzra6:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTIn the first year of Cyrus the king the same Cyrus the king made a decree concerning the house of God at Jerusalem, Let the house be builded, the place where they offered sacrifices, and let the foundations thereof be strongly laid; the height thereof threescore cubits, and the breadth thereof threescore cubits;VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 3. - Let the house be builded, the place where they offered sacrifice. Or, \"the place where they may offer sacrifice.\" It is the future, rather than the past, which Cyrus is contemplating. Let the foundation thereof be strongly laid. Isaiah had prophesied that Cyrus should \"say to Jerusalem, Thou shalt be built; and to the temple, Thy foundation shall be laid\" (Isaiah 44:28). Cyrus adds an injunction that the foundations be laid \"supportingly,\" or \"strongly,\" that so the house may the longer continue. The height thereof threescore cubits. Half the height of the first temple, according to the existing text of Chronicles (2 Chronicles 3:4); but one-third more than the previous height, as estimated by the author of Kings (1 Kings 6:2). And the breadth thereof threescore cubits. This breadth is thrice that of the main building, according to both Chronicles and Kings. It is even double that of the old temple, with the side chambers, which occupied a space of five cubits, or seven and a half feet, on either wing. That such an enlargement actually took effect would seem to be most improbable; and we may perhaps conclude that Cyrus designed a building on a grander scale than Zerubbabel, with the resources at his disposal, was able to erect. It is curious that Cyrus did not in his decree specify the length of the temple.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzra6:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWith three rows of great stones, and a row of new timber: and let the expences be given out of the king's house:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 4. - With three rows of great stones, and a row of new timber. The Septuagint interpreter understood by this that the new temple was to be four storeys high, three storeys being built of stone, and one of timber. The two wings of the temple of Solomon were undoubtedly three storeys high (1 Kings 6:6). But it is perhaps doubtful whether the word nidbak ever means \"storey.\" Most commentators suppose three courses of stone, and then a course of timber, repeated from foundation to summit; but there is no known example of such a mode of building. The expences were to be given out of the king's house, defrayed, i.e., out of the royal revenue; but either this intention of Cyrus was not carried out, or it was understood to apply only to the materials. Large sums were subscribed by the Jews themselves towards the building (Ezra 2:69), and large payments were made by them to the persons employed upon the work (Ezra 3:7).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzra6:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd also let the golden and silver vessels of the house of God, which Nebuchadnezzar took forth out of the temple which is at Jerusalem, and brought unto Babylon, be restored, and brought again unto the temple which is at Jerusalem, every one to his place, and place them in the house of God.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 5.- Also let the gold and silver vessels... be restored. The decree terminated with instructions for the restoration of the vessels. Undoubtedly it was impressed upon Cyrus, when he took Babylon, tNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzra6:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTNow therefore, Tatnai, governor beyond the river, Shetharboznai, and your companions the Apharsachites, which are beyond the river, be ye far from thence:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 6. - Now therefore, Tatnai. It is hardly to be supposed that Darius was as abrupt as this. Apparently the author has not thought it necessary to put on record the whole royal letter; but only the most essential parts of it - the recitation of the decree of Cyrus, and the further decree of Darius himself. The address of the letter, the opening words, and the passage by which the two main portions were linked together, are either omitted or greatly abbreviated. Be ye far from thence. Keep away from the Jews - do not go near them to trouble them.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzra6:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTLet the work of this house of God alone; let the governor of the Jews and the elders of the Jews build this house of God in his place.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzra6:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTMoreover I make a decree what ye shall do to the elders of these Jews for the building of this house of God: that of the king's goods, even of the tribute beyond the river, forthwith expences be given unto these men, that they be not hindered.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 8. - Moreover, I make a decree. Literally, \"By me too is a decree made.\" The decree of Cyrus is not enough. I add to it, and require youNEWLINENEWLINE(1) to pay the wages of the workmen employed out of the royal revenue, andNEWLINENEWLINE(2) to supply the temple perpetually with all that is needed for the regular sacrifices (see ver. 9). What ye shall do to the elders. Not, \"Lest ye do anything to the elders\" (LXX.); much less, \"What must be done by the elders\" (Vulg.); but, as in the A. V., \"What ye shall do to them\" - how ye shall act towards them. Of the tribute beyond the river forthwith expences be given to these men. The Persian satraps had to collect from their provinces a certain fixed sum as the royal tribute, and had to remit this sum annually to the court. Darius orders that the expenses of the men employed on the temple shall be paid by the satrap of Syria out of the royal tribute of his province, and only the balance remitted. Thus no additional burthen was laid upon the taxpayers.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzra6:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd that which they have need of, both young bullocks, and rams, and lambs, for the burnt offerings of the God of heaven, wheat, salt, wine, and oil, according to the appointment of the priests which are at Jerusalem, let it be given them day by day without fail:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 9. - Both young bullocks, and rams, and lambs. These were the chief sacrificial animals of the Jews - a lamb being required every morning and evening, two more on the sabbath, seven at each of the great feasts and at the beginning of each mouth, and fourteen on every day during the feast of tabernacles, altogether more than a thousand in the course of the year; and rams and bullocks being joined with the lambs on the more solemn occasions. The only other ordinary sacrificial animal was \"a kid of the goats.\" Wheat, salt, wine, and oil were needed for the \"meat offerings\" by which every burnt offering was accompanied (Exodus 29:40, 41; Leviticus 2:13, etc.). Let it be given them day by day. Since sacrifice was offered every day.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzra6:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThat they may offer sacrifices of sweet savours unto the God of heaven, and pray for the life of the king, and of his sons.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 10. - That they may offer sacrifices of sweet savours. Either incense, as in Daniel 2:46, or \"sacrifices that are pleasing and acceptable\" (see Genesis 8:21; Numbers 28:2). And pray for the life of the king. The Jews have always maintained the practice of praying for the civil ruler of any country in which they have had their abode. Jeremiah s exhortation to \"seek the peace\" of Babylon (Numbers 29:7) was understood in this way, and the tradition has been handed down even to the present day. Under monarchs so favour-able to them as the Achaemenian Persians the duty would certainly not have been neglected. And of his sons. In Persia \"the royal house\" was the special object of regard. Individual kings must die, but the house would go on (see the speech of Artemisia to Xerxes in 'Herod.,' 8:102; and compare the references to the \"gods of the royal house\" in the Inscriptions). Kings took special care of their sons. Thus Cyrus sent Cambyses back to Persia when he was about to attack the Massagetae ('Herod.,' 1:208), and Xerxes gave several of his sons into the charge of Artemisia, to convey them by ship to Asia, while he himself took the long and perilous journey by land (ibid. 8:103).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzra6:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAlso I have made a decree, that whosoever shall alter this word, let timber be pulled down from his house, and being set up, let him be hanged thereon; and let his house be made a dunghill for this.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 11. - Whoever shall alter this word. Rather, \"this edict.\" To alter the terms of a royal decree would in any country be a heinous offence. In Persia, where the monarch was absolute, and where decrees were regarded as \"altering not\" (Daniel 6:8, 12), it was a crime of the deepest dye. Hence the severity of the punishment threatened. The punishment has been explained as crucifixion, impalement, and \"whipping at a post;\" but there seems to be no real doubt that crucifixion is intended. Great criminals were almost always crucified by the Persians (see Brisson, 'De Regno Persarum,' 2. pp. 327-329; and comp. 'Behist. Inscr.,' col. 2. par. 14; col. 3. par. 8). Let his house be made a dunghill Some render \"be confiscated,\" but wrongly. The best Hebraists agree with our translators. The practice of concluding important documents with maledictions was common to the Persians, with the Assyrians, Babylonians, and others (see 'Records of the Past,' vol. 1. pp. 53, 105, 126; vol. 5. p. 26; vol. 7. pp. 19, 20, 56; vol. 9. pp. 35, 36, 95, 100 107, etc.).NEWLINENEWLINECHAPTER 6:13-22NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzra6:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the God that hath caused his name to dwell there destroy all kings and people, that shall put to their hand to alter and to destroy this house of God which is at Jerusalem.

Tatnai and Shethar-boznai showed no reluctance. They had no enmity against the Jews. Once clearly advertised of the king's wishes, they carried them out with zeal. The rapid completion of the temple must be in part attributed to their good-will.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzra6:14VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the elders of the Jews builded, and they prospered through the prophesying of Haggai the prophet and Zechariah the son of Iddo. And they builded, and finished it, according to the commandment of the God of Israel, and according to the commandment of Cyrus, and Darius, and Artaxerxes king of Persia.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 14. - And the elders of the Jews builded. See above, Ezra 5:5, 9. Probably the same as \"the chief of the fathers\" of Ezra 2:68, and Ezra 3:12. While the younger men were those who actually laboured, the elders superintended the work. Zerubbabel and Jeshua are no doubt included among them. And they prospered through the prophesying of Haggai... and Zechariah. It can well be understood that Haggai's earnest exhortations, his warnings, his threats, his sarcastic reproaches (Haggai 1:4, 9), his prophecies of a coming glory to the house greater than any known previously (Haggai 2:9), would rouse the spirit of the people, and make them labour diligently and perseveringly; but the visions of Zechariah seem less calculated to stir popular feeling. Still the knowledge that the angels of God were interesting themselves in the restoration of the temple (Zechariah 1:9-21; Zechariah 2:3, etc.), and the many promises that God would \"comfort Zion,\" and \"choose Jerusalem\" (Zechariah 1:17; Zechariah 2:12; Zechariah 3:2), and that the temple should assuredly be brought to completion (Zechariah 1:16; Zechariah 4:9), helped no doubt to strengthen the hands of Zerubbabel, and to keep up the zeal of the people. According to the commandment of Cyrus, and Darius, and Artaxerxes king of Persia. The commandments of Cyrus and of Darius have been set forth by the writer (see Ezra 1:3; Ezra 6:3-5, 7); but nothing has been said as yet of any commandment given by any Artaxerxes to \"build\" or \"finish\" the house. On the contrary, the only Arta-xerxes mentioned has been declared to have expressly forbidden the work to proceed (Ezra 4:7-22). The Artaxerxes of that place, moreover, reigned between Cyrus and Darius, whereas this Artaxerxes should, by the position of his name, be one of the successors of Darius. It has been suggested that Xerxes is intended, and that he may have been associated with his father during the building of the temple. But as Xerxes was the son of Atossa, whom Darius did not marry until he had ascended the throne (Herod., 3:88), he cannot have been more than five years old when the temple was finished. Nor was he ever associated on the throne by his father. Xerxes, therefore, cannot be meant. The next king to Xerxes, however, who really bore the name of Artaxerxes was a favourer of the Jews, and did give commandment to \"beautify,\" and in that sense \"finish,\" the house of the Lord (see Ezra 7:20, 27). We must suppose, therefore, that he is the person intended. The objection that the name is not spelt the same, but has a samech in one place instead of a schin, is too minute to require consideration. The Persians themselves spelt the name of Artaxerxes in more ways than one (Rawlinson, 'Cuneiform Inscriptions of Persia,' vol. 1. p. 348).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzra6:15VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd this house was finished on the third day of the month Adar, which was in the sixth year of the reign of Darius the king.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 15. - The house was finished on the third day of the month Adar. Haggai (Haggai 1:15) gives the exact day of the recommencement of the work as the twenty-fourth of Elul in Darius's second year. Ezra here gives the exact day of the completion. From Zerubbabel's laying of the foundation (Ezra 3:10), the time that had elapsed was twenty-one years. From the recommencement under the inspiriting influence of the two prophets, the time was only four years, five months, and ten days. DEDICATION OF THE SECOND TEMPLE (Ezra 6:16-18). Following the example of Solomon, who had solemnly \"dedicated\" the first temple (1 Kings 8:63), and had offered on the occasion a sacrifice unexampled for its magnitude in the whole of Jewish history (ibid.), Zerubbabel now, under the advice of two prophets, inaugurated the new building with a similar ceremony. In \"the day of small things\" it was not possible for him to emulate Solomon's magnificence in respect of the number of victims. Solomon had sacrificed 22,000 oxen and 120,000 sheep. Zerubbabel's means only enabled him to make an offering of 712 animals, more than half of them lambs. He did, however, according to his ability; and God, who accepts all our endeavours according to that we have, and not according to that we have not, was content to receive graciously the humble offering made to him, and to bless the building thus inaugurated with a glory unknown to the first temple. The Lord himself, the Messenger of the covenant, so long sought by his people, suddenly came to this temple (Malachi 3:1) - came to it, and frequented it, and taught in it, and gave it a dignity and a majesty far beyond the first temple, which possessed indeed the Shechinah, but was once, and once only, vouchsafed a brief manifestation of the actual Divine presence (2 Chronicles 7:1).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzra6:16VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the children of Israel, the priests, and the Levites, and the rest of the children of the captivity, kept the dedication of this house of God with joy,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 16. - The children of Israel. Again the writer is careful to present the returned exiles to us as \"Israel,\" and not merely \"Judah\" (comp. 2:70; 3:1, 10, 11; 4:3; 5:1). This is especially fitting when he is about to explain why the number of the he-goats offered was twelve (see the next verse). Kept the dedication of this house of God. The primary dedication seems to be glanced at in the words, \"the dedication of this house,\" an expression repeated in the next verse. It is one of the great objects of Ezra to link the present with the past, the new temple with the old, the restored religion with that of former times.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzra6:17VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd offered at the dedication of this house of God an hundred bullocks, two hundred rams, four hundred lambs; and for a sin offering for all Israel, twelve he goats, according to the number of the tribes of Israel.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 17. - And offered... an hundred bullocks, two hundred rams, four hundred lambs. A poor offering, if it be compared, not alone with Solomon's (1 Kings 8:63), but even with Hezekiah's (2 Chronicles 30:24), or Josiah's (ibid. 35:7). Hundreds now take the place of the thousands offered under the old monarchy. A sin offering for all Israel. See comment on ver. 16. We may assume that some of every tribe had returned with Zerubbabel, and that consequently it was possible to regard the re-established people as \"Israel\" (comp. Nehemiah 11:20; Zechariah 8:13; Malachi 1:1); though, since the great majority were Jews, they were more commonly spoken of as \"Judah\" (Ezra 4:1, 6, 23; Ezra 5:1, 5; Ezra 6:7, 14; Zechariah 8:15, etc.). Zerubbabel, desirous of emphasising the nobler and grander view, made this solemn sin offering of twelve he-goats, one for each of the tribes. Ezra acted similarly when he brought the second colony (infra, Ezra 8:35).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzra6:18VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd they set the priests in their divisions, and the Levites in their courses, for the service of God, which is at Jerusalem; as it is written in the book of Moses.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 18. - They set the priests in their divisions, and the Levites in their courses. The completion of the new temple was naturally followed by an arrangement of the ministers corresponding to that which had been originally made by David, and afterwards adopted by Solomon, for the service of the old temple (see 1 Chronicles 23:6-23; 1 Chronicles 24:1-19). This arrangement was based upon the ordinances of the law with respect to the respective offices of the two orders, as given in the Book of Numbers (Numbers 3:6-10; Numbers 8:6-26), and, so far, was according to the writing of the book of Moses. But the \"courses\" themselves were not established till David's time. CELEBRATION OF THE PASSOVER IN THE ENSUING MONTH, AND OBSERVANCE OF THE FEAST OF UNLEAVENED BREAD (Ezra 6:19-22). Specially solemn passovers were celebrated on specially solemn occasions; and these received special record at the hands of the sacred writers. Of this kind are the passover celebrated By Hezekiah in the year B.C. 726, recorded in 2 Chronicles 30, and that celebrated by Josiah in B.C. 624, recorded in 2 Chronicles 35. Both of these followed upon a cleansing of the temple, and restoration of the temple worship after a period of suspension. Ezra seems to place the passover of B.C. 516 in the same category. It marked the period of the full re-establishment of the regular ordinances of religion, more or less interrupted from the time of the destruction of the temple by Nebuchadnezzar. It terminated the abnormal and commenced the normal condition of things. Perhaps it is to mark this, that Ezra at this point disuses the Chaldee dialect, which he had introduced in ch. 4:8, and returns to the Hebrew, the established language of the Jewish religion.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzra6:19VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the children of the captivity kept the passover upon the fourteenth day of the first month.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 19. - Upon the fourteenth day of the first month.

Ezra really makes a distinction between the priests and the Levites, the former of whom, he says, \"purified themselves,\" while the latter \"were all pure, as one man;\" wherefore the latter killed the paschal lambs, not only for themselves and for the people, but also for their brethren the priests. It would seem that, as in Hezekiah's time, \"the Levites were more upright in heart to sanctify themselves than the priests\" (2 Chronicles 29:34).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzra6:21VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the children of Israel, which were come again out of captivity, and all such as had separated themselves unto them from the filthiness of the heathen of the land, to seek the LORD God of Israel, did eat,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 21. - Such as had separated themselves unto them. i.e. such proselytes as had been made since the return from the captivity. We have perhaps a mention of some of these proselytes in the \"Sherezer\" and \"Regem-melech\" sent by the men of Bethel a short time before this to make inquiries of the priests at Jerusalem in respect of fasting (Zechariah 7:2). These names are Assyrian, and not likely to have been given to persons born Jews. From the filthiness of the heathen means \"from their moral defilements\" (see ch. 9:11). It is always to be borne in mind that heathen idolatry was full of such impurities.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzra6:22VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd kept the feast of unleavened bread seven days with joy: for the LORD had made them joyful, and turned the heart of the king of Assyria unto them, to strengthen their hands in the work of the house of God, the God of Israel.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 22. - Kept the feast of unleavened bread seven days. As required by the law (Exodus 12:15; Exodus 13:7; Leviticus 23:6, etc.). On the spiritual meaning of the feast, see 1 Corinthians 5:8. The Lord had... turned the heart of the king of Assyria. It has been generally supposed that Darius is personally meant here, and surprise has been expressed at his being called \"king of Assyria.\" That title is never elsewhere given in Scripture to a king of Persia. Perhaps the writer's real intention in this place is to express in a general way the thankfulness of the Jews that God had turned, the hearts of their civil rulers, whether Assyrians, Babylonians, or Persians, from hostility to friendship, having replaced the bitter enmity of Sennacherib and Nebuchadnezzar by the hearty good-will of Cyrus and Darius. On this view, Assyria would represent merely the great power of Western Asia, and \"the king\" would not be Darius personally, but the lord of Western Asia in a more general way, who by God's goodness had become the permanent friend of Israel instead of her oppressor and enemy.NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINE","Ezra.7":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzra7:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTNow after these things, in the reign of Artaxerxes king of Persia, Ezra the son of Seraiah, the son of Azariah, the son of Hilkiah,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 1. - The writer makes a marked division between his first and second sections by means of the words, \"Now after these things,\" which he uses in this place only. The actual interval seems to have been one of between fifty-seven and fifty-eight years, the sixth year of Darius being B.C. 516, and the seventh of Artaxerxes Longimanus B.C. 458. Artaxerxes is in the original \"Artakhshatra,\" which reproduces the Persian Artakhshatra with the change of only one letter. That Longimanus, the grandson of Darius, is meant seems to follow from the fact that Eliashib, the grandson of Jeshua is high priest under him (Nehemiah 3:1).NEWLINENEWLINEDarius, correspond to Jeshua,NEWLINENEWLINEXerxes correspond to JoiakimNEWLINENEWLINEArtaxerxes correspond to EliashibNEWLINENEWLINEBut for this it would be possible to regard the Artaxerxes of Ezra (ch. 7.) and Nehemiah as Mnemon. Ezra the son of Seraiah. Probably the great-great-grandson. In the language of the sacred writers, every descendant is a \"son,\" and every ancestor a \"father.\" Christ is \"the son of David,\" and David \"the son of Abraham\" (Matthew 1:1). Joram \"begat\" Uzziah (ibid. 8), his great-great-grandson. Jochebed was \"the daughter of Levi (Exodus 2:1). Ezra omits the names of his father, grandfather, and great-grandfather, who were undistinguished, and claims descent from Seraiah, the last high priest who had ministered in Solomon's temple (2 Kings 25:18). Azariah, the father of Seraiah, does not occur in either Kings or Chronicles; but Hilkiah, Azariah's father, is no doubt the high priest of Josiah's time (2 Kings 22:4-14; 2 Chronicles 34:14-22, etc.).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzra7:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe son of Shallum, the son of Zadok, the son of Ahitub,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 2-4. - This portion of the genealogy agrees exactly with that of Jehozadak in 1 Chronicles 6:3-15, excepting in the omission, which has been already noticed, of six names between Azariah and Meraioth. We may gather from 1 Chronicles 9:11 that a Meraioth is also omitted between the Zadok and Ahitub of ver. 2. EZRA'S JOURNEY FROM BABYLON TO JERUSALEM, WITH DATES (Xerxes 7:6-10). In introducing himself, Ezra seems to regard it 25 of primary importance to state two things -NEWLINENEWLINE(1) who he was, andNEWLINENEWLINE(2) what place he had in a history of which the main object is to give an account of the return of Israel from captivity. In connection with the former point, he gives, first of all, his genealogy; and, secondly, the account of himself contained in vers. 6 and 10. He describes himself as \"a ready scribe\" - one who \"had prepared his heart to seek the law of the Lord, and to do it,\" and also \"to teach in Israel statutes and judgments.\" In connection with the latter, he is careful to put before us at once the fact that he too, like Zerubbabel, \"went up from Babylon\" to Jerusalem by the permission of the Persian king, and, like Zerubbabel, was accompanied by priests, Levites, both singers and porters, Nethinim, and a number of the people (ver. 7). He adds an exact statement as to the date of both his departure and arrival, very natural in one who is his own biographer, and very interesting to the general historian. He also, without any parade of religious sentiment, acknowledges the baud of God as directing, helping, and sustaining him in all his proceedings, ascribing to the Divine favour, especially, Artaxerxes allowance of his journey, and his safe accomplishment of it within a moderate space of time (vers. 6, 9).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzra7:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe son of Amariah, the son of Azariah, the son of Meraioth,VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzra7:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe son of Zerahiah, the son of Uzzi, the son of Bukki,VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzra7:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe son of Abishua, the son of Phinehas, the son of Eleazar, the son of Aaron the chief priest:VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzra7:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThis Ezra went up from Babylon; and he was a ready scribe in the law of Moses, which the LORD God of Israel had given: and the king granted him all his request, according to the hand of the LORD his God upon him.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 6. - This Ezra went up. See comment on Ezra 2:1, where the same expression — \"went up\" - is used. He was a ready scribe in the law of Moses. On the meaning of this phrase, and the new position occupied by \"scribes\" after the captivity, see Introduction to Ezra,' § 5. Which the Lord God of Israel had given. It is characteristic of Ezra's piety never to forget that the law was not a mere human code given by an earthly lawgiver, not even a national treasure, the accumulation of centuries, but a direct Divine gift \"the law of the Lord\" (ver. 10), \"the words of the commandments of the Lord, and of his statutes to Israel\" (ver. 11), \"the law which the Lord had commanded by Moses\" (Nehemiah 8:14). According to the hand of the Lord his God upon him. i.e. \"by reason of God's favour to him.\" God, by reason of his favour to Ezra, inclined the heart of Artaxerxes towards him, so that he granted all his request. The nature of the \"request\" is not directly stated, but may be gathered from the \"letter of Artaxerxes,\" especially vers. 13, 14, 16.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzra7:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd there went up some of the children of Israel, and of the priests, and the Levites, and the singers, and the porters, and the Nethinims, unto Jerusalem, in the seventh year of Artaxerxes the king.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 7. - The same six classes are here mentioned as furnishing colonists under Ezra which, according to the earlier narrative (Ezra 2:70), had accompanied Zerubbabel. The order in which the classes are mentioned is nearly, but not quite, the same. In the seventh year of Artaxerxes. This is the emphatic clause of the verse; Ezra's main object in the section being to give the exact date of his journey. As Artaxerxes began to reign in B.C. 464 (Clinton, F. H., vol. 2. p. 380, note b), his seventh year would be B.C. 458.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzra7:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he came to Jerusalem in the fifth month, which was in the seventh year of the king.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 8. - And he came to Jerusalem in the fifth month. From the ninth verse it appears that the first day of the first month - the opening day of the year - was selected for the commencement of the journey. This was no doubt viewed as an auspicious day for beginning an important undertaking. The time occupied on the way was exactly four months, which is longer than might have been supposed to be necessary. Herodotus reckoned it a three months journey from Sardis to Susa (ver. 53), and the younger Cyrus conducted an army from Ephesus to Cunaxa, near Babylon, in ninety- three marching days (Xen, 'Anab' 2 1, § 6) - the distance in either case being considerably more than that from Babylon to Jerusalem, even supposing the route followed to have been by Balis and Aleppo. But a caravan, like an army, requires rests; and we hear of one such rest at Ahava (Ezra 8:15). Cyrus gave his troops more days of rest than of movement, and took half the year to reach Cunaxa from Ephesus. We need not be surprised, therefore, that Ezra's journey occupied four months. Some delay must almost certainly have been caused by the perils of the route (see Ezra 8:31).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzra7:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor upon the first day of the first month began he to go up from Babylon, and on the first day of the fifth month came he to Jerusalem, according to the good hand of his God upon him.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 9. - According to the good hand of his God. For the meaning of this phrase, see comment on ver. 6. The special favour of God here intended would seem to be deliverance from certain enemies who designed to attack the caravan on the way (see the next chapter, vers. 21-23, 31).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzra7:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor Ezra had prepared his heart to seek the law of the LORD, and to do it, and to teach in Israel statutes and judgments.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 10. - For Ezra had prepared his heart, etc. God's favour towards Ezra, and the prosperous issue of his journey, were the consequences of his having set his heart on learning God's will, and doing it, and teaching it to others. To seek the law is to aim at obtaining a complete knowledge of it. To teach statutes and judgments is to inculcate both the ceremonial and the moral precepts. Ezra appears as a teacher of righteousness in Ezra 10:10, 11, and again in Nehemiah 8:2-18NEWLINENEWLINECHAPTER 7:11-28 THE DECREE OF ARTAXERXES WITH RESPECT TO EZRA (vers. 11-26). The present decree was of the nature of a firman granted to an individual. It embodied, in the first place, a certain number of provisions which were temporary. Of this character were -NEWLINENEWLINE1. the permission accorded to all Persian subjects of Israelite descent to accompany Ezra to Jerusalem (ver. 13);NEWLINENEWLINE2. the commission to Ezra to convey to Jerusalem certain offerings made by the king and his chief courtiers to the God of Israel (vers. 15, 19);NEWLINENEWLINE3. the permission given him to convey to Jerusalem the free-will offerings of Jews and others resident in Babylonia (ver. 16);NEWLINENEWLINE4. permission to Ezra to draw on the royal treasury to the amount of a hundred talents of silver, a hundred measures of wheat, a hundred \"baths\" of wine, a hundred \"baths\" of oil, and salt to any amount (ver. 22); and,NEWLINENEWLINE5. an indefinite commission to \"inquire\" (ver. 14). Besides these temporary enactments, the decree contained certain provisions of a more permanent nature.NEWLINENEWLINE1. Ezra was invested with the chief authority over the whole district \"beyond the river,\" and was commissioned to appoint all the subordinate \"magistrates and judges\" (ver. 25).NEWLINENEWLINE2. He was authorised to enforce his decisions by the penalties of imprisonment, confiscation of goods, banishment, and even death itself (ver. 26).NEWLINENEWLINE3. An exemption from taxation of every kind was granted to all grades of the sacerdotal order - to the priests, the Levites, the singers, the porters, the Nethinim, and the lowest grade of \"ministers\" - to all, in fact, who were engaged in the performance of any sacred function connected with the temple (ver. 24). This last provision was absolutely permanent, and probably continued in force down to the close of the empire.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzra7:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTNow this is the copy of the letter that the king Artaxerxes gave unto Ezra the priest, the scribe, even a scribe of the words of the commandments of the LORD, and of his statutes to Israel.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 11. - The copy of the letter that the king... gave to Ezra. This decree, as already observed, was a private firman, one copy of which only was made, which was presented to Ezra, and was his authority for doing certain things himself, and for requiring certain acts of others. The priest. This is implied in the genealogy (vers. 1-5), but not directly stated elsewhere by Ezra himself. Nehemiah, however, designates him similarly (Ezra 8:2, 9). His most usual title is the \"scribe.\" A scribe of the words of the commandments of the Lord. Not so much a writer as an expounder (see above, ver. 10).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzra7:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTArtaxerxes, king of kings, unto Ezra the priest, a scribe of the law of the God of heaven, perfect peace, and at such a time.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 12. - Artaxerxes, king of kings. \"King of kings, kkshayathiya khshaya-thiyanam,\" an equivalent of the modern shahinshah, was a recognised title of the Persian monarchs, and is found in every Persian inscription of any considerable length (Rawlinson, 'Cuneiform Inscriptions of Persis,' vol. 1 pp. 195, 271, 279, 287, 292, etc.). It was a title that had been used occasionally, though not at all frequently, by the Assyrian monarchs ('Records of the Past,' vol. 3. p. 41; vol. 5. p. 8), and naturally expressed the fact that those monarchs for the most part maintained the native princes on the thrones of the countries which they conquered (see Isaiah 10:8). It was less appropriate to the Persians, whose empire was in the main satrapial, but still had a basis of truth to rest upon, since the Persian monarch had always a certain number of tributary kings under him ( cf. 'Herod.,' 5:104, 118; 8:142; Xen., 'Anab.,' 1:2, §12; 'Hellen.,' 4:1,§§ 3,4,etc.). The Parthian kings took the title from the time of Mithridates I.; and from them it passed to the Sassanians, who style themselves malkan malka, from first to last, upon their coins. The God of heaven. On this favourite Persian expression see comment on Ezra 1:2. Perfect peace. There is nothing in the Chaldee original in any way corresponding to \"peace;\" and the participle passage being translated as in the margin of the A. V. - \"to Ezra the priest, a perfect scribe of the law of the God of heaven.\" And at such a time. Rather, \"and so forth,\" as in Ezra 4:10, 11, 17.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzra7:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTI make a decree, that all they of the people of Israel, and of his priests and Levites, in my realm, which are minded of their own freewill to go up to Jerusalem, go with thee.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 13. - All they of the people of Israel. The decree of Artaxerxes is as wide in its terms as the proclamation of Cyrus (Ezra 1:3), and gives permission not to the Jews only, but to all Israelites of whatever tribe, to accompany Ezra to Jerusalem. That Israelites of all the tribes actually went up to Jerusalem on the occasion seems indicated by the \"twelve bullocks for all Israel,\" which those who returned with Ezra offered on their arrival to the \"God of Israel\" (see Ezra 8:35).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzra7:14VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTForasmuch as thou art sent of the king, and of his seven counsellers, to inquire concerning Judah and Jerusalem, according to the law of thy God which is in thine hand;VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 14. - Ezra received his commission from the king, and from his seven counsellors, who thus seem to occupy an important position in the Persian state. They are commonly identified with the \"seven princes of Persia and Media,\" mentioned in Esther (Esther 1:14), \"which saw the king's face,\" and \"sate first in the kingdom.\" A conjecture, which, though not unreasonable, cannot be said to be substantiated, connects the \"seven counsellors\" with the seven great Persian septs, or families, which had privileges beyond the rest, and among them the right of unrestricted access to the royal presence ('Herod.,' 3:84). The commission which Ezra received is described in this verse as one to inquire concerning Judah and Jerusalem; but the subject-matter of the inquiry is not mentioned. He can scarcely have been sent to make inquiry whether the law of Moses was observed or no, since that was certainly not a matter with which the Persian government would concern itself. Probably he was to inquire generally into the material prosperity of the province, and to report thereon.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzra7:15VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd to carry the silver and gold, which the king and his counsellers have freely offered unto the God of Israel, whose habitation is in Jerusalem,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 15. - And to carry the silver and gold, which the king and his counsellors have freely offered. Large sums in specie had in ancient times to be remitted from one country to another under escort. The roads were never safe from robbers; and the more considerable the remittance, the greater the danger of its being intercepted. We hear of its being usual to protect the treasure annually remitted to Jerusalem from Babylon in Roman times by an escort of above 20,000 men (see Joseph., 'Ant. Jud.,' 18:9, § 1). The God of Israel, whose habitation is in Jerusalem. No more seems to be meant by \"habitation\" here than by \"house\" in Ezra 1:2, 3. Artaxerxes does not regard Jehovah as a local God.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzra7:16VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd all the silver and gold that thou canst find in all the province of Babylon, with the freewill offering of the people, and of the priests, offering willingly for the house of their God which is in Jerusalem:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 16. - All the silver and gold that thou canst find. Rather, \"that thou canst obtain\" - \"all that thou canst get my other subjects to give thee.\" Compare the proclamation of Cyrus (Ezra 1:4, 6).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzra7:17VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThat thou mayest buy speedily with this money bullocks, rams, lambs, with their meat offerings and their drink offerings, and offer them upon the altar of the house of your God which is in Jerusalem.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 17. - That thou mayest buy speedily with this money bullocks, etc. The primary application of the money sent by Ezra was to be the maintenance of the Jewish ritual in its full splendour (compare the decree of Darius, Ezra 6:9, 10). The residue was, however, to be employed in any way that Ezra, acting under Divine guidance, might direct (see below, ver. 18). Apparently, this residue was actually employed on beautifying the temple (see ver. 27).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzra7:18VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd whatsoever shall seem good to thee, and to thy brethren, to do with the rest of the silver and the gold, that do after the will of your God.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzra7:19VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe vessels also that are given thee for the service of the house of thy God, those deliver thou before the God of Jerusalem.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 19. - The vessels also. It does not appear that these were sacred vessels belonging to the temple, like those which Cyrus had intrusted to Zerubbabel for restoration to the house of God. Rather, it would seem, they were a part of the voluntary \"offering\" mentioned in ver. 15, in which they are distinctly included (Ezra 8:25-28). We may perhaps conclude that the vessels sent with Zerubbabel had proved insufficient in number for the great festivals.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzra7:20VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd whatsoever more shall be needful for the house of thy God, which thou shalt have occasion to bestow, bestow it out of the king's treasure house.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 20. - Whatever more shall be needful. Here the terms of the firman are very wide indeed, and authorise apparently an unlimited application of the royal revenue, or, at any rate, of the revenue of the province, to any purpose in any way connected with the temple. Probably it was expected that Ezra's own discretion would act as a restraint. If this failed, the royal treasurers would see that the amounts specified in ver. 22 were not exceeded. The king's treasure-house is not the royal treasury at Susa, to which the tribute went up from the various provinces, but the local treasury of Judaea or Syria, to which the Jews made their remittances, and on which Ezra was now authorised to draw. Such local treasuries existed of necessity under a satrapial system.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzra7:21VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd I, even I Artaxerxes the king, do make a decree to all the treasurers which are beyond the river, that whatsoever Ezra the priest, the scribe of the law of the God of heaven, shall require of you, it be done speedily,VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzra7:22VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTUnto an hundred talents of silver, and to an hundred measures of wheat, and to an hundred baths of wine, and to an hundred baths of oil, and salt without prescribing how much.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 22. - Unto a hundred talents of silver. At the lowest estimate of the Jewish silver talent, this would be a permission to draw on the royal treasury to the amount of £24,000 sterling. If we adopt the views of Mr. R.S. Peele ('Dict. of the Bible, Articles, MONEY and WEIGHTS AND MEASURES), it would authorise drawing to the amount of £40,000. A hundred measures of wheat. Literally, \"a hundred cors of wheat,\" as given in the margin. The cor is variously estimated, at 44.25 gallons and at 86.67 gallons. It contained ten baths. Orders on the treasury for so much wheat, wine, oil, and salt sound strangely in modern ears; but were natural enough in the Persian system, where taxation was partly in kind, and every province had to remit to the court the choicest portion of its produce. Wine, corn, oil, and salt were all of them produced abundantly in Palestine, which was \"a land of corn and wine, a land of bread and vineyards, a land of off olive, and of honey\" (2 Kings 18:32), and which, in the region about the Dead Sea, abounded with salt.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzra7:23VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWhatsoever is commanded by the God of heaven, let it be diligently done for the house of the God of heaven: for why should there be wrath against the realm of the king and his sons?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 23. - Why should there be wrath against the realm? In the seventh year of Artaxerxes Longimanns there was \"wrath against the realm\" of Persia in a very dangerous quarter, viz., Egypt. Egypt had revolted from the Persians in B.C. 460, and in the following year, with the assistance of the Athenians, had driven the last Persian out of the country. A vain attempt was made by an embassy to Sparta, towards the close of B.C. 459, to force Athens to recall her troops. In B.C. 458, Artaxerxes' seventh year, it was resolved that a Persian force should attempt the recovery of the revolted country. Artaxerxes gives his firman to Ezra when this expedition is preparing to start, and partly alludes to the past \"wrath,\" shown in the success of the rebels, partly deprecates any further visitation. Without pretending to penetrate the Divine counsels, it may be noticed that from the year B.C. 458 things went well for the Persians in Egypt. Memphis was recovered in that year or the next; and in B.C. 455 the Athenians were finally defeated, and the province recovered. The king and his sons. This mention of the \"sons\" of Artaxerxes has been regarded as a proof that the Artaxerxes of Esther was Mnemon, and not Longimanus (Patrick). But it is quite a gratuitous supposition that Longimanus, who had attained to manhood before he ascended the throne, had no sons in the seventh year of his reign. Ultimately he left behind him eighteen sons (Ctesias, 'Exc. Pers.,' § 44).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzra7:24VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAlso we certify you, that touching any of the priests and Levites, singers, porters, Nethinims, or ministers of this house of God, it shall not be lawful to impose toll, tribute, or custom, upon them.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 24. - We certify you. The use of the plural is curious. Hitherto the king has made every permission and command to rest on his own sole authority (see vers. 12, 13, 21). Now that he reaches the most important point in the whole of his decree - the permanent exemption of a large part of the people from liability to taxation of any kind, his style changes, and he says, \"We certify you.\" Perhaps he speaks in the name of himself and his successors; or possibly he means to say that in this matter he has asked and obtained the assent and consent of his council (compare ver. 28). Or ministers. Rather, \"and ministers.\" It is generally allowed that the word here translated \"ministers\" is not applied to the Nethinim, but to that still lower grade of attendants in the sanctuary called \"Solomon's servants\" in Ezra 2:55-58, and Nehemiah 7:57-60. It shall not be lawful to impose toll, tribute, or custom upon them It may be suspected from this proviso that the Persians exempted from taxation their own (Magian) priests, though of this there is no other evidence. But they would scarcely have placed a foreign priesthood on a higher level of favour than their own.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzra7:25VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd thou, Ezra, after the wisdom of thy God, that is in thine hand, set magistrates and judges, which may judge all the people that are beyond the river, all such as know the laws of thy God; and teach ye them that know them not.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 25. - And thou, Ezra. This conclusion would be by itself sufficient to remove the document out of the ordinary category of \"decrees\" or \"edicts,\" and to render it, what it is called in ver. 11, nish-tevan, \"a letter.\" After the wisdom of thy God, that is in thy hand. i.e. \"that is in thy possession.\" Set magistrates and judges. Both the words used are derived from roots signifying \"to judge,\" and it is difficult to draw any distinction between them. The one translated \"magistrates\" is that which gives its title to the Book of \"Judges.\" Which may judge all the people that are beyond the river, all such as know the laws of thy God. The latter clause is probably intended to be limitative of the former, and to consign to Ezra's government only the Jewish portion of the population, in which, however, are to be reckoned the proselytes (see comment on Ezra 6:21). And teach ye them that know them not. As the other inhabitants of Syria were not Zoroastrians, but idolaters, Ezra was given free permission to spread his religion among them.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzra7:26VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd whosoever will not do the law of thy God, and the law of the king, let judgment be executed speedily upon him, whether it be unto death, or to banishment, or to confiscation of goods, or to imprisonment.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 26. - Finally, to Ezra is intrusted distinctly the civil government of the Jewish people, with power to fine, imprison, banish, or put to death offenders, as he may think right. These powers were always intrusted by the Persians to the civil administrators of provinces, who were autocrats within their respective territories, and responsible to the king alone for the exercise of their authority. EZRA'S THANKSGIVING ON RECEIPT OF ARTAXERXES' LETTER (Ezra 7:27, 28). With an abruptness that may appear strange, but which has many parallels in the works of Oriental writers, Ezra passes without a word of explanation from Artaxerxes' letter to his own thanksgiving upon the receipt of it.

The form of his thanksgiving a little resembles that of David in 1 Chronicles 29:10. The Lord God of our fathers is an unusual phrase, only elsewhere employed by David (1 Chronicles 29:18) and Jehoshaphat (2 Chronicles 20:6). \"God of our fathers\" is more common, being found in Deuteronomy (Deuteronomy 26:7) and Acts (Acts 3:13; Acts 5:30), as well as in Chronicles frequently. Which hath put such a thought as this in the king's heart. Compare Ezra 1:1. and Ezra 6:22. All thoughts favorable to the Jews are regarded by Ezra as impressed upon the hearts of heathen kings by the direct action of God. To beautify.

DETAILS OF EZRA'S JOURNEY FROM BABYLON TO JERUSALEM (Ezra 8:15-31). We gather from scattered statements in this passage -NEWLINENEWLINE1. That Ezra, with his companions, after a journey of nine days' duration, reached Ahava from Babylon on the ninth day of the first month;NEWLINENEWLINE2. That he rested three days at Ahava, and proclaimed a fast;NEWLINENEWLINE3. That he was there joined by a small number of Levites and a considerable body of Nethinims from the immediate neighbourhood;NEWLINENEWLINE4. That, on the twelfth day of the first month, he resumed his journey, and, though threatened by some opposition upon the way, arrived safely at his destination fourteen weeks after he quitted Ahava, and exactly four months after he had started from Babylon. The only other important fact mentioned is, that at Ahava twelve of the principal priests were selected by Ezra, and the royal offering of silver, gold, and vessels handed over to them for safe custody, after having been carefully weighed. The weights are recorded with Ezra's usual exactness in vers. 26, 27.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzra8:14VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTOf the sons also of Bigvai; Uthai, and Zabbud, and with them seventy males.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzra8:15VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd I gathered them together to the river that runneth to Ahava; and there abode we in tents three days: and I viewed the people, and the priests, and found there none of the sons of Levi.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 15. -NEWLINENEWLINEI gathered them together to the river that runneth to Ahava. The \"river that runneth to Ahava\" is now generally identified with the Is of Herodotus (1:179), a small stream flowing into the Euphrates from the east, at a point where stood a city of the same name, distant (according to Herodotus) eight days' journey from Babylon. The city appears to be mentioned under the slightly variant forms of Ava (עַוָּא) and Ivah (עִוָּה) in the Second Book of Kings (2 Kings 17:24; 19:13). It is called Aia, or Aba, by the LXX.; Ihi in the Talmud; Aei by Isidore of Charax. The modern name is Hit. The town has always been one of some importance in connection with the bitumen springs of the neighbourhood. Ezra s reason for selecting the place as a halting-point seems to have been the fact that many Jews were settled in the district (see ver. 17). We abode in tents. A large caravan, like Ezra's, even when it reached a town, would pitch its tents outside, and remain in them rather than scatter itself among the khans and caravanserais. The phrase is therefore to be understood literally. I viewed the people. Rather, \"I looked among the people\" - I looked to see whether there were any Levites or no. (\"Quaesivi in populo et in sacerdotibus de filiis Levi. - Vulg.) And found there none of the sons of Levi. It is difficult to account for the fact; but there seems certainly to have been a special disinclination to return to Jerusalem on the part of the Levites. Only seventy-four went up with Zerubbabel, when the priests who returned were 4289 (Ezra 2:36-40); and now there was not a single one in the whole of Ezra's band. Did the jealous spirit of Korah (Numbers 16:8-10) still animate the great body of the tribe?NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzra8:16VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen sent I for Eliezer, for Ariel, for Shemaiah, and for Elnathan, and for Jarib, and for Elnathan, and for Nathan, and for Zechariah, and for Meshullam, chief men; also for Joiarib, and for Elnathan, men of understanding.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzra8:17VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd I sent them with commandment unto Iddo the chief at the place Casiphia, and I told them what they should say unto Iddo, and to his brethren the Nethinims, at the place Casiphia, that they should bring unto us ministers for the house of our God.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 17. - Iddo, the chief at the place Casiphia. Not \"the Caspian\" certainly; nor even \"Casvin,\" which is at least 400 miles from Hit by the nearest route, but some Babylonian village in the vicinity of Ahava, not otherwise known to us. Unto Iddo, and to his brethren the Nethinims. The \"and\" here is rightly supplied. It has fallen out in consequence of the word Iddo ending with the same letter. Iddo, though the head man of the village under the Persians, belonged by descent to the comparatively low grade of the Nethinims.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzra8:18VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd by the good hand of our God upon us they brought us a man of understanding, of the sons of Mahli, the son of Levi, the son of Israel; and Sherebiah, with his sons and his brethren, eighteen;VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 18. - By the good hand of our God upon us. This is Ezra's usual mode of acknowledging the good providence and favour of Almighty God (see Ezra 7:6, 9, 27; and Ezra 8:31). Similar expressions occur also in Nehemiah (Nehemiah 2:8, 18), but not elsewhere in Scripture. A man of understanding. In the Hebrew Ish-sekel, which some take for a proper name, but without any necessity. No such name is known to have existed; and the real name of \"the man of understanding\" appears to have been \"Sherebiah,\" who is mentioned more than once in Nehemiah (Nehemiah 8:7; Nehemiah 9:4, 5) as a chief Levite. And Sherebiah should be simply \"Sherebiah.\" The preposition \"and\" (Hebrew ן) has been inserted by a careless copyist.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzra8:19VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Hashabiah, and with him Jeshaiah of the sons of Merari, his brethren and their sons, twenty;VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzra8:20VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAlso of the Nethinims, whom David and the princes had appointed for the service of the Levites, two hundred and twenty Nethinims: all of them were expressed by name.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 20. - The Nethinims, whom David and the princes had appointed. We learn this fact from the present passage only; since neither in Kings nor Chronicles is there any mention made of David's adding to the hieroduli, or temple servants. It is, however, quite in accordance with his other arrangements that he should have done so. The original Nethinims were the Gibeonites (Joshua 9:23). All... were expressed by name. Iddo sent to Ezra a list of the Nethinims, which, however, he does not think it necessary to insert.NEWLINENEWLINECHAPTER 8:21-36NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzra8:21VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen I proclaimed a fast there, at the river of Ahava, that we might afflict ourselves before our God, to seek of him a right way for us, and for our little ones, and for all our substance.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 21. - Then I proclaimed a fast there. The fight of the civil ruler to \"proclaim a fast\" was unquestioned among the Jews and Israelites. Jezebel proclaimed one in Ahab's name when she wished to impress the Jezreelites with the notion that a great crime had been committed. Jehoshaphat did the same when he was invaded by the Ammonites, Moabites, and Mehunim (2 Chronicles 20:1-3). A fast was proclaimed in the fifth year of Jehoiakim when the kingdom of Judah was menaced by Nebuchadnezzar (Jeremiah 36:9). Ezra therefore assumes that he may command one now, in connection with the perils of the coming journey. That we might afflict ourselves. The Jews were commanded to \"afflict themselves\" on the great day of atonement (Leviticus 16:29), and understood that the affliction was to be mainly by fasting and abstaining from the bath. To ask of him a right way. Or \"a direct road,\" i.e. a prosperous and unimpeded journey to Jerusalem. For us and our little ones. The colonists went up attended by their families.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzra8:22VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor I was ashamed to require of the king a band of soldiers and horsemen to help us against the enemy in the way: because we had spoken unto the king, saying, The hand of our God is upon all them for good that seek him; but his power and his wrath is against all them that forsake him.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 22. - I was ashamed to require of the king a band of soldiers. Before he apprehended danger Ezra had boasted to Artaxerxes of the power and goodness of God, and had spoken of himself and his brethren as assured of the Divine protection. Now that peril threatened he found himself afraid, and would have been glad of such an escort as Nehemiah obtained at a later date (Nehemiah 2:9). But after his boasts he was ashamed to confess his fear. Who the enemy in the way was it is impossible to decide; but we may gather from ver. 31 that it was no imaginary foe. Probably some of the Arab tribes, who owed no allegiance to Persia, had formed a design to intercept the caravan and plunder it.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzra8:23VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTSo we fasted and besought our God for this: and he was intreated of us.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzra8:24VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen I separated twelve of the chief of the priests, Sherebiah, Hashabiah, and ten of their brethren with them,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 24. - Then I separated twelve of the chief of the priests, Sherebiah, Hashabiah, etc. Our translators, following the Vulgate, have omitted to render the preposition לְ, which occurs in the Hebrew text before the name of Sherebiah, and have thus represented Sherebiah and Hashabiah as priests, whereas they were not priests, but Levites, as appears from vers. 18, 19. The true sense is given by the LXX. - \"Then I assigned twelve of the chief priests to Sherebiah, Hashabiah, and ten of their brethren; i.e. \"then I appointed twelve chief priests to act with twelve chief Levites, of whom Sherebiah and Hashabiah were two, in the matter of the royal offering.\" Ezra seems to have considered, that as the gift of Artaxerxes was an offering to the house of God, it ought to be handed over at once to the custody of the ministers of religion, and not remain in secular hands (compare ver. 28).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzra8:25VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd weighed unto them the silver, and the gold, and the vessels, even the offering of the house of our God, which the king, and his counsellers, and his lords, and all Israel there present, had offered:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 25. - And weighed unto the the silver, etc. We may gather from this that the silver and gold were in bars or ingots, and not in coined money. The Persians had coined money at this tin. e, but the Treasury kept the bulk of its stores in bars (Herod., 3:96).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzra8:26VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTI even weighed unto their hand six hundred and fifty talents of silver, and silver vessels an hundred talents, and of gold an hundred talents;VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 26. - Six hundred and fifty talents of silver, according to Mr. Peele's estimate of the talent, would be nearly a quarter of a million of our money. The annual revenue of Persia was about three and a half millions (Herod., 3:95). Of gold an hundred talents. Rather more than a million of our money.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzra8:27VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAlso twenty basons of gold, of a thousand drams; and two vessels of fine copper, precious as gold.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 27. - Twenty basons of gold, of a thousand drams (see comment on Ezra 2:69). The \"basons\" would be worth about £55 each. Fine copper, precious as gold. The metal intended is probably that known to the Romans as orichalchum, which is generally believed to have been brass, but which may have been a more complicated amalgam. Being rarely, and perhaps only accidentally, produced, this metal was highly valued.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzra8:28VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd I said unto them, Ye are holy unto the LORD; the vessels are holy also; and the silver and the gold are a freewill offering unto the LORD God of your fathers.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 28. - Ye are holy.

Rather, \"the river Ahava,\" as in the Vulgate (\"a fiumine Ahava\"). The place had probably taken its name from the stream. The twelfth day of the first month. Compare Ezra 7:9, and Ezra 8:15, from which it appears that Ahava was reached by Ezra and his company on the ninth day after they left Babylon, which helps to identify Ahava with Is, since Is (according to Herodotus) was eight days' journey from Babylon (see comment on ver. 15). God delivered us from ... . such as lay in wait. The boast of Ezra (ver. 22) was justified by the event. He \"trusted in God,\" and was \"delivered\" - how delivered we are not told, but evidently through no \"arm of flesh.\" The hand of God led him safely through all the perils of the way, and brought him and his companions without loss or damage to the \"city of their rest.\" EZRA'S THREE DAYS' REST AT JERUSALEM, AND SUBSEQUENT EXECUTION OF THE MORE PRESSING OF THE COMMISSIONS INTRUSTED TO HIM (Ezra 8:32-36). After the fatigues of a four months' journey, a brief period of complete rest was well-nigh necessary. Like Nehemiah (Nehemiah 2:11), Ezra was content with a rest of three days. On the fourth he discharged himself of his commission to present to the temple treasury the offerings of the Persian king, his counsellors and lords (ver. 25), together with that spontaneously contributed by the Israelites who had accompanied him (Ezra 7:16). This he did by appearing in person before the priests and Levites who were in charge of the temple, and making over to them the entire offering of gold, silver, and vessels which had been brought to Jerusalem from Babylon. At the same time the exiles whom he had induced to return, and whom he had conducted in safety through so long a journey, sacrificed on the altar of burnt offerings a number of bullocks, rams, lambs, and he-goats, as a token of their thankfulness to God for delivering them from the perils of the way. After this Ezra proceeded to make known to the satraps and other governors of the provinces lying west of the Euphrates the terms of the permanent commission which he had received from the king. The result was that these officials thenceforth helped the Jews instead of hindering them, and furnished the necessary supplies for the temple service.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzra8:32VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd we came to Jerusalem, and abode there three days.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzra8:33VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTNow on the fourth day was the silver and the gold and the vessels weighed in the house of our God by the hand of Meremoth the son of Uriah the priest; and with him was Eleazar the son of Phinehas; and with them was Jozabad the son of Jeshua, and Noadiah the son of Binnui, Levites;VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 33. - Meremoth the son of Uriah, or Urijah, was one of the heads of the priestly order, both under Ezra and under Nehemiah. He is mentioned as repairing two pieces of the wall of Jerusalem when Nehemiah was governor (Nehemiah 3:4, 21), and also as one of those who set their seal to the covenant with God which the whole people entered into, under Ezra's and Nehemiah's guidance, shortly after the completion of the wall, in B.C. 444. Eleazar the son of Phinehas is perhaps the Eleazar mentioned as taking part in the dedication of the wall (Nehemiah 12:42). Like Meremoth, he was a priest. Jozabad and Noadiah, chief Levites, occur again in ch. 10:23, and Nehemiah 8:7; Nehemiah 10:9; and Nehemiah 12:3.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzra8:34VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBy number and by weight of every one: and all the weight was written at that time.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 34. - By number and by weight. The gold and the silver were weighed; the vessels were both counted and weighed; the object being to see that what was delivered to Meremoth corresponded exactly with what Ezra had given in charge to Sherebiah, Hashabiah, and others at Ahava (see above, vers. 24-27). All the weight was written at that time. Not only were the vessels counted and weighed, but an inventory of them was made by the priests in charge of the temple, and the weight of every vessel noted. Such was the care taken to prevent any embezzlement of the temple property by its custodians.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzra8:35VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAlso the children of those that had been carried away, which were come out of the captivity, offered burnt offerings unto the God of Israel, twelve bullocks for all Israel, ninety and six rams, seventy and seven lambs, twelve he goats for a sin offering: all this was a burnt offering unto the LORD.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 35. - Also the children of those who had been carried away. i.e. the newly-returned exiles. Like their predecessors under Zernbbabel, who had made an offering for all Israel (Ezra 6:17), so the present colonists under Ezra, assuming that they represented all Israel, offered for the whole nation. The classes of animals offered are the same on the two occasions, and the number of the he-goats is identical; but in every other case the victims are far less numerous now than on the former occasion. This is fully accounted for by the comparatively small number of those who returned under Ezra.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzra8:36VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd they delivered the king's commissions unto the king's lieutenants, and to the governors on this side the river: and they furthered the people, and the house of God.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 36. - And they delivered the king's commissions. Parts of Ezra's firman concerned vitally the other provincial governors, and had of necessity to be communicated to them. Such were the provisoes concerning Ezra's power of drawing upon the provincial treasuries for corn, wine, oil, salt, and money (Ezra 7:22, 23), and concerning the exemption of all ranks of the Jewish sacred order from taxation of any kind whatsoever (ibid. ver. 24). Unto the king's lieutenants, and to the governors. The word translated \"lieutenants\" is that which corresponds to the Persian term \"satrap,\" and designates the highest class of the Persian provincial governors. That translated \"governor\" is the term which has been already applied by Ezra to Tatnai (Ezra 5:3, 4) and Zerubbabel (Ezra 6:7). It denotes a lower grade of official. They furthered the people. The satraps and lower officials, on being made acquainted with the king's wishes, readily complied with them, and became supporters and favourers of the Jewish people.NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINE","Ezra.9":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzra9:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTNow when these things were done, the princes came to me, saying, The people of Israel, and the priests, and the Levites, have not separated themselves from the people of the lands, doing according to their abominations, even of the Canaanites, the Hittites, the Perizzites, the Jebusites, the Ammonites, the Moabites, the Egyptians, and the Amorites.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 1. - When these things were done. It must have been some considerable time afterwards. Ezra reached Jerusalem on the first day of the fifth month (Ezra 7:9), rested three days (Ezra 8:32), and on the fourth day of the same month made over the vessels to the temple authorities. It was not till the seventeenth day of the ninth month that, on Ezra's motion, the matter of the mixed marriages was taken in hand (Ezra 10:8, 9). Yet we cannot suppose that action was long delayed after the matter came to Ezra's knowledge. The princes. The civil heads of the community, whom Ezra found at the head of affairs on his arrival, and whose authority he did not wholly supersede (see Ezra 10:14, 16). The people of the lands. The idolatrous nations inhabiting the districts adjoining Palestine: Egyptians and Amorites on the south; Moabites and Ammonites on the east; Canaanites probably towards the north and the north-west. Doing according to their abominations. Rather, \"in respect of their abominations.\" The complaint was not so much that the Jews had as yet actually adopted idolatrous functions, as that they did not keep themselves wholly aloof from them. The foreign wives would introduce idolatrous rites into their very houses.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzra9:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor they have taken of their daughters for themselves, and for their sons: so that the holy seed have mingled themselves with the people of those lands: yea, the hand of the princes and rulers hath been chief in this trespass.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 2. - The holy seed. Compare Isaiah 6:13. The \"seed of Israel,\" however much it polluted itself by transgressions, was still \"holy\" by profession, by call, by obligation, by prophetic announcement. They were \"a kingdom of priests, a holy nation\" (Exodus 19:6); bound to be \"separated from all the people that were on the face of the earth\" (Exodus 33:16), and to keep themselves a \"peculiar people.\" When they mingled themselves with the people of the lands, they not only broke a positive command (Deuteronomy 7:3), but did their best to frustrate God's entire purpose in respect of them, and to render all that he had done for them of no effect. The hand of the princes and rulers hath been chief in the trespass. \"Princes and rulers\" are here opposed to people of the middle and lower ranks. The upper classes, whether clerical or lay, had been the chief offenders (see Ezra 10:18); and compare the similar defection of Jews of the upper classes in Nehemiah's time (Nehemiah 6:17, 18; Nehemiah 13:4, 28). EZRA'S ASTONISHMENT AND HORROR (Ezra 9:3, 4). In Babylonia, whence Ezra had come, the inclination to intermarry with the heathen had not, it would seem, shown itself. Exiles in a foreign land naturally cling to each other under their adverse circumstances, and, moreover, being despised by those among whom they sojourn, are not readily accepted by them into social fellowship, much less into affinity and alliance. Thus the thing was to Ezra a new thing. His familiarity with the Law, and, perhaps we may add, his insight into the grounds upon which the Law upon this point was founded, caused him to view the matter as one of the gravest kind, and to feel shocked and horror-struck at what was told him respecting it. He showed his feelings with the usual openness and abandon of an Oriental: first rending both his outer and his inner garments, then tearing his hair and his beard, and finally\" sitting down astonied,\" motionless and speechless, until the time of the evening sacrifice. Such a manifestation of horror and amazement was well calculated to impress and affect the sympathetic and ardent people over whom Providence had placed him.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzra9:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd when I heard this thing, I rent my garment and my mantle, and plucked off the hair of my head and of my beard, and sat down astonied.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 3. - I rent my garment and my mantle. Rending the clothes was always, and still is, one of the commonest Oriental modes of showing grief. Reuben rent his clothes when his brothers sold Joseph to the Midianites, and Jacob did the same when he believed that Joseph was dead (Genesis 37:29, 34). Job \"rent his mantle\" on learning the death of his sons and daughters (Job 1:20); and his friends \"rent every one his mantle when they came to mourn with him and comfort him\" (Job 2:11, 12). Rent clothes indicated that a messenger was a messenger of woe (1 Samuel 4:12; 2 Samuel 1:2), or that a man had heard something that had greatly shocked him, and of which he wished to express his horror (2 Kings 18:37; Matthew 26:65). Ezra's action is of this last kind, expressive of horror more than of grief, but perhaps in some degree of grief also. And plucked off the hair of my head and of my beard. These are somewhat unusual signs of grief among the Orientals, who were wont to shave the head in great mourning, but seldom tore the hair out by the roots. The practice is not elsewhere mentioned in Scripture, excepting in the apocryphal books (1 Esdras 8:71; 2 Esdras 1:8; Apoc. Esther 4:2). And sat down astonied. Compare Daniel 4:19; Daniel 8:27, where the same verb is used in the same sense.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzra9:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen were assembled unto me every one that trembled at the words of the God of Israel, because of the transgression of those that had been carried away; and I sat astonied until the evening sacrifice.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 4. - Then were assembled unto me. The open manifestation by Ezra of his grief and horror produced an immediate effect. A crowd assembled around him, attracted by the unusual sight - partly sympathizing, partly no doubt curious. Every one came that trembled at the words of the God of Israel; by which is meant not so much all God-fearing persons (see Isaiah 66:2) as all who were alarmed at the transgression of the commands of God (Ezra 10:3), and at the threats which the Law contained against transgressors (Deuteronomy 7:4). Because of the transgression of those that had been carried away. The transgression of \"the children of the captivity\" (Ezra 4:1) - of those who had been removed to Babylon and had returned under Zerubbabel. I sat astonied until the evening sacrifice. As morning is the time for business in the East, we may assume that the princes had waited upon Ezra tolerably early in the day - before noon, at any rate - to communicate their intelligence. The evening sacrifice took place at three in the afternoon. Ezra must, therefore, either from the intensity of his own feelings or with the view of impressing the people, have \"sat astonied\" - speechless and motionless - for several hours. EZRA'S CONFESSION AND PRAYER TO GOD (Ezra 9:5-15). The most remarkable feature of Ezra's confession is the thoroughness with which he identifies himself with his erring countrymen, blushes for their transgressions, and is ashamed for their misconduct. All their sins he appears to consider as his sins, all their disobedience as his disobedience, all their perils as his perils. Another striking feature is his sense of the exceeding sinfulness of the particular sin of the time (see vers. 6, 7, 10). He views it as a \"great trespass\" - one that \"is grown up into the heavens\" - which is equivalent to a complete forsaking of God's commandments, and on account of Which he and his people \"cannot stand before\" God. This feeling seems based partly on the nature of the sin itself (ver. 14), but also, and in an especial way, on a strong sense of the ingratitude shown by the people in turning from God so soon after he had forgiven their former sins against him, and allowed them to return from the captivity, rebuild the temple, and re-establish themselves as a nation. If after their deliverance they again fell away, the sin could not but be unpardonable; and the punishment to be expected was a final uprooting and destruction from which there could be no recovery (vers. 13, 14).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzra9:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd at the evening sacrifice I arose up from my heaviness; and having rent my garment and my mantle, I fell upon my knees, and spread out my hands unto the LORD my God,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 5. - At the evening sacrifice I arose up from my heaviness. The time of sacrifice was the fittest time for prayer, especially for a prayer in which acknowledgment of sin was to form a large part. Sacrifice symbolized expiation; and Ezra probably felt that his supplication would be helped by the expiatory rite which was being performed at the time. He rent his garment and his mantle a second time, as a renewed indication of sorrow, and with the view of impressing the people who \"were assembled unto him\" (ver. 4) the more, and stirring them up to penitence. \"Segnius irritant animum demissa per aures Quam quae sunt oculis subjecta fidelibus.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzra9:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd said, O my God, I am ashamed and blush to lift up my face to thee, my God: for our iniquities are increased over our head, and our trespass is grown up unto the heavens.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 6. - I am ashamed and blush. Jeremiah had complained that in his day those who \"committed abominations were not at all ashamed, neither could they blush\" (Jeremiah 6:15; Jeremiah 8:12). Ezra, with these words in his thoughts possibly, begins his confession with a protestation that he at any rate is not open to this reproach - he blushes and burns with shame for the sins of his people. Our iniquities are increased over our head. i.e. have kept on rising like a flood; \"gone over our head\" (Psalm 38:4), and overwhelmed us. And our trespass is grown up unto the heavens. Has grown to such a height that it has attracted the notice of God, and made him angry with us.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzra9:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTSince the days of our fathers have we been in a great trespass unto this day; and for our iniquities have we, our kings, and our priests, been delivered into the hand of the kings of the lands, to the sword, to captivity, and to a spoil, and to confusion of face, as it is this day.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 7. - Since the days of our fathers. The historical sketches in Nehemiah (Nehemiah 9:6-35) and the Acts (Acts 7:2-53) show that this phrase might be taken in a very wide sense, and be regarded as including the \"fathers\" of the nation who came out of Egypt; but perhaps Ezra has rather in his mind the series of idolatries belonging to the kingly period, and extending from Solomon to Zedekiah. We, our kings, and our priests, have been delivered into the hand of the kings of the lands. Menahem into the hand of Pul, Pekah of Tiglath-Pileser, Hoshea of Shalmaneser or Sargon, Manasseh of Esarhaddon, Josiah of Pharaoh-Necho, Jehoahaz, Jehoiakim, Jehoiachin, and Zedekiah, of Nebuchadnezzar. That the priests had their full share in the calamities of the captivity appears from 2 Kings 25:18; Jeremiah 52:24; Ezekiel 1:1-3. And to confusion of face. i.e. To disgrace and shame (compare Psalm 44:13-15).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzra9:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd now for a little space grace hath been shewed from the LORD our God, to leave us a remnant to escape, and to give us a nail in his holy place, that our God may lighten our eyes, and give us a little reviving in our bondage.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 8. - And now for a little space grace hath been showed. The \"little space\" must be understood relatively to the long enjoyment of Divine favour from Abraham to Zedekiah. It was a space of more than eighty years. A remnant to escape. The Hebrew has simply p'leythah, \"a remnant,\" the \"remnant\" being that which had escaped the two dangers of destruction and absorption, and had returned from Babylon to Palestine. To give us a nail. \"A nail\" seems to mean here \"a firm and sure abode,\" as our translators note in the margin.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzra9:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor we were bondmen; yet our God hath not forsaken us in our bondage, but hath extended mercy unto us in the sight of the kings of Persia, to give us a reviving, to set up the house of our God, and to repair the desolations thereof, and to give us a wall in Judah and in Jerusalem.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 9. - For we were bondsmen. Rather, \"we are.\" The Jews had not recovered their independence. They continued to be the subjects of a despotic monarch, and were therefore 'abddim, \"slaves.\" All the favour shown them by the kings of Persia had not changed this fact. To give us a wall. That is to say, \"a shelter.\" The city wall still lay in ruins (see Nehemiah 1:3; Nehemiah 2:13, etc.).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzra9:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd now, O our God, what shall we say after this? for we have forsaken thy commandments,VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzra9:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWhich thou hast commanded by thy servants the prophets, saying, The land, unto which ye go to possess it, is an unclean land with the filthiness of the people of the lands, with their abominations, which have filled it from one end to another with their uncleanness.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 11. - The land, unto which ye go to possess it, is an unclean land, etc. These exact words do not occur elsewhere; but the \"unclean\" and corrupt character of the Canaanitish nations is constantly proclaimed in the Law, and was the sole reason why their land was taken from them and given to the Israelites. On the special character of their \"filthiness\" and \"abominations\" see Deuteronomy 12:2, 3; Leviticus 18:6-27.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzra9:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTNow therefore give not your daughters unto their sons, neither take their daughters unto your sons, nor seek their peace or their wealth for ever: that ye may be strong, and eat the good of the land, and leave it for an inheritance to your children for ever.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 12. - Give not your daughters, etc. Here Deuteronomy 7:3 is plainly referred to, though not verbally quoted. This is the sole place in the Law where the double injunction is given, Exodus 34:16 referring to the taking of wives only. Nor seek their peace or their wealth for ever. So Moses had enjoined with special reference to the Moabites and Ammonites (Deuteronomy 23:6). With regard to the other idolatrous nations, the exact command was \"to make no covenant with them\" (Exodus 23:32; Exodus 34:12), i.e. no terms of peace. Much the same was probably meant by both injunctions. That ye may be strong. See Deuteronomy 11:8. And eat the good of the land. These words are taken from Isaiah 1:19. And leave it for an inheritance, etc. No single passage seems to be referred to here, but the clause embodies the idea found in Deuteronomy 11:9; Proverbs 10:27; Ezekiel 37:25, and elsewhere.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzra9:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd after all that is come upon us for our evil deeds, and for our great trespass, seeing that thou our God hast punished us less than our iniquities deserve, and hast given us such deliverance as this;VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 13, 14. - After all that is come upon us, etc. After the punishments that we have suffered, the loss of our independence, of our temple, and our city, the long and weary period of captivity and servitude in a foreign land, which should have bent our stubborn spirits to obedience; and after the mercy shown us in the fact that thou hast punished us less than our iniquities deserved, and given us a deliverance, or rather a residue, such as this, which should have stirred us up to gratitude and love, should we again break thy commandments, and fall away, what can we expect but final abandonment, complete and entire destruction? If neither severity nor kindness avail anything, what can God do more? must he not view our case as hopeless, and so make an end of us altogether? (Compare Isaiah 5:1-7; Luke 13:6-9).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzra9:14VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTShould we again break thy commandments, and join in affinity with the people of these abominations? wouldest not thou be angry with us till thou hadst consumed us, so that there should be no remnant nor escaping?VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzra9:15VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTO LORD God of Israel, thou art righteous: for we remain yet escaped, as it is this day: behold, we are before thee in our trespasses: for we cannot stand before thee because of this.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 15. - Thou art righteous: for we remain yet escaped. Righteousness, in its widest sense, includes mercy; and so the meaning here may be, \"Thou art good and gracious; of which thy having spared us is a proof;\" or tsaddik may have its more usual sense of \"just,\" and Ezra may mean to say, \"Thou art just, and therefore hast brought us to the low estate in which we are to-day, and made us a mere remnant.\" We are before thee in our trespasses. We are here, in thy presence; here, before thy holy place (Acts 10:1); sinners, with all our sins upon us, confessing our guilt; for we cannot stand before thee - we cannot boldly stand up and face thee (\"Who shall, stand in thy sight when Thou art angry? Psalm 76:7), because of this our heinous transgression, for which there is no excuse.NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINE",
