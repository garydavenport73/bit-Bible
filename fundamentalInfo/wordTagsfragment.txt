WORDSTARTOnWORDEND the contrary, it is there the natural conclusion of the wars between the WORDSTARTPhilistinesWORDEND and WORDSTARTSaulWORDEND. This engagement took place (1Sam.28.4; 1Sam.29.1, 1Sam.29.11) WORDSTARTonWORDEND the plains of WORDSTARTJezreelWORDEND. The name WORDSTARTJezreelWORDEND marks either the WORDSTARTcityWORDEND (Josh.19.18; 1Kgs.21.1, 1Kgs.21.11), or the celebrated WORDSTARTvalleyWORDEND or WORDSTARTplainWORDEND called in later times WORDSTARTEsdraelonWORDEND, the WORDSTARTGreekWORDEND form of the word. The WORDSTARTplainWORDEND in its largest proportions may be said to have been bounded WORDSTARTbyWORDEND the Mediterranean (although it is called the WORDSTARTplainWORDEND of WORDSTARTAcchoWORDEND, where it abuts WORDSTARTonWORDEND that sea) and the WORDSTARTJordanWORDEND, and WORDSTARTbyWORDEND the WORDSTARTSamariaWORDEND and WORDSTARTCarmelWORDEND WORDSTARTrangesWORDEND WORDSTARTonWORDEND the WORDSTARTsouthWORDEND and WORDSTARTsouthWORDEND-west, and those of WORDSTARTGalileeWORDEND WORDSTARTonWORDEND the north and northeast. While called a \"WORDSTARTplainWORDEND\" and \"the great WORDSTARTplainWORDEND\" in Judg.1.8, its name in the Old WORDSTARTTestamentWORDEND is \"WORDSTARTvalleyWORDEND.\" It lay like a scalene triangle, with its apex in the direction of the Mediterranean, opening into the above-mentioned WORDSTARTplainWORDEND of WORDSTARTAcchoWORDEND, and its sides going from right to left, about fifteen, twelve, and eighteen miles long respectively. The allusions to it in Old WORDSTARTTestamentWORDEND history are frequent. Its exceeding richness is now turned into desolation unexceeded. WORDSTARTMegiddoWORDEND (Josh.12.21; Judg.1.27), the WORDSTARTcityWORDEND, centre of a smaller WORDSTARTvalleyWORDEND called WORDSTARTbyWORDEND the same name (1Chr.7.29; Judg.5.19), was situated within it, in the direction of WORDSTARTCarmelWORDEND. (For very full and interesting account of the WORDSTARTJezreelWORDEND with which we have here to do, and of WORDSTARTEsdraelonWORDEND, see Stanley's 'WORDSTARTSinaiWORDEND and WORDSTARTPalestineWORDEND,' pp. 336-356, edit. 1866.) WORDSTARTMountWORDEND WORDSTARTGilboaWORDEND identifies for us the exact battle-WORDSTARTfieldWORDEND of the text. It is the same with that WORDSTARTonWORDEND which WORDSTARTGideonWORDEND triumphed (Judg.7.1, Judg.7.8). It is in the WORDSTARTlotWORDEND of WORDSTARTIssacharWORDEND, flanked WORDSTARTbyWORDEND the Little WORDSTARTHermonWORDEND ridge WORDSTARTonWORDEND the north-WORDSTARTeastWORDEND, and WORDSTARTbyWORDEND WORDSTARTGilboaWORDEND WORDSTARTonWORDEND the WORDSTARTsouthWORDEND-WORDSTARTeastWORDEND, a mountain range of ten miles long, about six hundred feet high, and mentioned only in the melancholy connection of this history. The flight of the men of WORDSTARTIsraelWORDEND and of WORDSTARTSaulWORDEND was from the WORDSTARTplainWORDEND back to their position WORDSTARTonWORDEND WORDSTARTMountWORDEND WORDSTARTGilboaWORDEND, where they were pursued, overtaken, and slain. The modern name of the town WORDSTARTJezreelWORDEND is Zerin, the depraved aliases of which appear as Gerin and Zazzin (Robinson's 'Bibl. Res.,' 3:162-165, 3rd edit.), and WORDSTARTJezreelWORDEND, WORDSTARTShunemWORDEND, and WORDSTARTBethWORDEND-shean are the three most conspicuous places in this part of the whole WORDSTARTplainWORDEND of WORDSTARTEsdraelonWORDEND.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles10:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEPULPITVERSEBEGINAnd the WORDSTARTPhilistinesWORDEND followed hard after WORDSTARTSaulWORDEND, and after his sons; and the WORDSTARTPhilistinesWORDEND slew WORDSTARTJonathanWORDEND, and WORDSTARTAbinadabWORDEND, and Malchishua, the sons of WORDSTARTSaulWORDEND.PULPITVERSEFINISHNEWLINEVerse 2. - Followed hard after. The WORDSTARTHebrewWORDEND verb implies all this and rather more, viz. that they made the pursuit of WORDSTARTSaulWORDEND and his sons their one special object. Luther's \"Hingen sich au WORDSTARTSaulWORDEND\" expresses this forcibly. WORDSTARTAbinadabWORDEND; or Ishui (see 1Chr.8.33; 1Sam.14.49). The sons of WORDSTARTSaulWORDEND. Omit the article, which is not present in the WORDSTARTHebrewWORDEND text. The fourth son, not withstanding our ver. 6, survived (2Sam.2.8-2Sam.2.15).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles10:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEPULPITVERSEBEGINAnd the battle went sore against WORDSTARTSaulWORDEND, and the archers hit him, and he was wounded of the archers.PULPITVERSEFINISHNEWLINEVerse 3. - The archers hit him. The literal translation would be, the shooters, men with the WORDSTARTbowWORDEND, found him. The context makes it WORDSTARTplainWORDEND that the meaning is that the WORDSTARTarrowsWORDEND of the pursuers rather than the pursuers themselves \"found\" him, and these made him argue all the WORDSTARTrestWORDEND. To this our Authorized WORDSTARTVersionWORDEND has jumped WORDSTARTbyWORDEND the one word \"hit\" him. It is evident from ver. 8 that the WORDSTARTPhilistinesWORDEND did not find the body of WORDSTARTSaulWORDEND to recognize it till next WORDSTARTdayWORDEND. And he was wounded of the archers. The radical meaning of the verb (חוּל) is rather \"to twist\" (torquere) or \"be twisted,\" \"writhe\" (torqueri). And the meaning here is in harmony with it, that WORDSTARTSaulWORDEND trembled from fear or writhed with the pain already inflicted of the WORDSTARTarrowsWORDEND. Hence the parallel WORDSTARTpassageWORDEND couples with this same verb, the adverb מְאֹך.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles10:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEPULPITVERSEBEGINThen said WORDSTARTSaulWORDEND to his armourbearer, Draw thy WORDSTARTswordWORDEND, and thrust me through therewith; lest these uncircumcised come and abuse me. But his armourbearer would not; for he was sore afraid. WORDSTARTSoWORDEND WORDSTARTSaulWORDEND took a WORDSTARTswordWORDEND, and fell upon it.PULPITVERSEFINISHNEWLINEVerse 4. - And abuse me. The main idea of the Hithp. of the verb here used is to satisfy the thirst of WORDSTARTlustWORDEND or cruelty. WORDSTARTSaulWORDEND probably feared not the abuse of mocking only, but that of torture. In the corresponding WORDSTARTpassageWORDEND this verb is preceded WORDSTARTbyWORDEND the clause, and thrust me through. His WORDSTARTarmourWORDEND-bearer would not. He refused the request or bidding of WORDSTARTSaulWORDEND, WORDSTARTnoWORDEND doubt mainly in respect of the fact that WORDSTARTSaulWORDEND was still \"the anointed.\" We have a full description of both the loose arms and of the WORDSTARTarmourWORDEND of the body in the case of the Philistine WORDSTARTGoliathWORDEND (1Sam.17.4-1Sam.17.7). It is one of the world's surprising facts that the making of arms and WORDSTARTarmourWORDEND, and the acquiring of skill in the using of them, should, as in fact all history attests, WORDSTARTdateWORDEND from WORDSTARTsoWORDEND early a period (Gen.31.26; Gen.34.25). As compared with the history and the fragmentary re. mains of classical antiquity, those of WORDSTARTScriptureWORDEND are remarkably scanty WORDSTARTonWORDEND this subject. The WORDSTARTswordWORDEND is the earliest mentioned in WORDSTARTScriptureWORDEND, carried in a sheath (1Sam.17.51; 2Sam.20.8; 1Chr.21.27); though the WORDSTARTHebrewWORDEND word is here different from that used in WORDSTARTSamuelWORDEND. It was slung WORDSTARTbyWORDEND a WORDSTARTgirdleWORDEND (1Sam.25.13), rested WORDSTARTonWORDEND hips or thigh (2Sam.20.8; Judg.3.16; Ps.45.3), and was sometimes \"two-edged\" (Judg.3.16; Ps.149.6). Then follows the spear in several varieties, as in 1Sam.17.7; 1Chr.11.11; 1Chr.20.5; 1Chr.23.9. Again as a WORDSTARTjavelinWORDEND (Josh.8.14-Josh.8.25; WORDSTARTJobWORDEND.29.23; 1Sam.17.6, where in the Authorized WORDSTARTVersionWORDEND it is called WORDSTARTtargetWORDEND, or gorget). Again as a lancet (1Kgs.18.28; 1Chr.12.8, 1Chr.12.24; 2Chr.11.12; Neh.4.13; Ezek.39.9). In addition to these three chief varieties of spear - the spear proper, the WORDSTARTjavelinWORDEND, WORDSTARTendWORDEND the lancet - there is mention of two other weapons used at all events as the WORDSTARTdartWORDEND of a WORDSTARTlightWORDEND kind would be used, in 2Chr.23.10, and elsewhere, and in 2Sam.8.14, respectively. After WORDSTARTswordWORDEND and spear rank the WORDSTARTbowWORDEND and arrow (Gen.21.20; 1Sam.31.3; 1Chr.8.40; 1Chr.12.2; Ps.68.9; Ps.120.4; WORDSTARTJobWORDEND.6.4) And lastly, the WORDSTARTslingWORDEND (Judg.20.16; 1Sam.25.29; 2Kgs.3.25), and a very strong weapon of the same kind mentioned in 2Chr.26.15. The chief articles worn as bodily WORDSTARTarmourWORDEND were the WORDSTARTbreastplateWORDEND (1Sam.17.5, 1Sam.17.38); the somewhat obscure WORDSTARThabergeonWORDEND, mentioned only twice, in WORDSTARTnoWORDEND connection then of battle (Exod.28.32; Exod.39.23), the original name of which, tacharah, is found WORDSTARTonWORDEND Egyptian papyri of the nineteenth dynasty, - it seems to have been a species of doublet or corselet; the WORDSTARThelmetWORDEND (1Sam.17.5; 1Sam.26.14; Ezek.27.10); WORDSTARTgreavesWORDEND (1Sam.17.6); two kinds of WORDSTARTshieldWORDEND (1Sam.17.7, 1Sam.17.41, compared with 1Kgs.10.16; 2Chr.9.15); and lastly the article mentioned in 2Sam.8.7; 1Chr.18.7; 2Kgs.11.10; 2Chr.23.9; Song.4.4; Jer.51.11; Ezek.27.11; and of which we can say nothing certainly bearing upon its nature or its use, except that it was made of WORDSTARTgoldWORDEND. WORDSTARTArmourWORDEND-bearers, then, the first distinct mention of whom we find in Judg.9.54, may WORDSTARTwellWORDEND have been a necessity for kings and for the great. WORDSTARTJoabWORDEND had ten (2Sam.18.15). The word is not expressed as a compound in WORDSTARTHebrewWORDEND, but as \"one carrying (כֵלַים) arms.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles10:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEPULPITVERSEBEGINAnd when his armourbearer saw that WORDSTARTSaulWORDEND was dead, he fell likewise WORDSTARTonWORDEND the WORDSTARTswordWORDEND, and died.PULPITVERSEFINISHNEWLINEVerse 5. - And died. The parallel (1Sam.31.5) adds \"with him.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles10:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEPULPITVERSEBEGINSo WORDSTARTSaulWORDEND died, and his three sons, and all his WORDSTARThouseWORDEND died together.PULPITVERSEFINISHNEWLINEVerse 6. - All his WORDSTARThouseWORDEND. In place of these words, the parallel (1Sam.31.6) has, \"And his WORDSTARTarmourWORDEND-bearer, and all his men, that same WORDSTARTdayWORDEND together.\" This reading avoids the ambiguity referred to already (ver. 2). In either WORDSTARTpassageWORDEND the moral is WORDSTARTplainWORDEND, that the WORDSTARTendWORDEND and ruin of WORDSTARTSaulWORDEND's family as a whole had arrived, rather than literally that the whole, including every member, of that family had perished.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles10:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEPULPITVERSEBEGINAnd when all the men of WORDSTARTIsraelWORDEND that were in the WORDSTARTvalleyWORDEND saw that they fled, and that WORDSTARTSaulWORDEND and his sons were dead, then they forsook their cities, and fled: and the WORDSTARTPhilistinesWORDEND came and dwelt in them.PULPITVERSEFINISHNEWLINEVerse 7. - In the WORDSTARTvalleyWORDEND. In place of these words, the parallel (1Sam.31.7) has, \"WORDSTARTOnWORDEND the other side of the WORDSTARTvalleyWORDEND, and.., WORDSTARTonWORDEND the other side WORDSTARTJordanWORDEND.\" We have here a clear instance of the desire of the compiler of WORDSTARTChroniclesWORDEND to compress his narrative, while the fidelity of the parallel narrative is testi-fled in the naturalness of its statements, amounting to this, that, quick as the intelligence or report could reach all those Israelites who were at all within the range of the victorious WORDSTARTPhilistinesWORDEND, they hastened to vacate their abodes.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles10:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEPULPITVERSEBEGINAnd it came to pass WORDSTARTonWORDEND the morrow, when the WORDSTARTPhilistinesWORDEND came to strip the slain, that they found WORDSTARTSaulWORDEND and his sons fallen in WORDSTARTmountWORDEND WORDSTARTGilboaWORDEND.PULPITVERSEFINISHNEWLINEVerse 8. - And his sons. The parallel (1Sam.31.8) says explicitly, \"And his three sons.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles10:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEPULPITVERSEBEGINAnd when they had stripped him, they took his head, and his WORDSTARTarmourWORDEND, and sent into the land of the WORDSTARTPhilistinesWORDEND round about, to carry tidings unto their idols, and to the people.PULPITVERSEFINISHNEWLINEVerse 9. - And when they had stripped him, they took his head, and his WORDSTARTarmourWORDEND. Some comparing this with the parallel (1Sam.31.9), \"They cut off his head, and stripped off his WORDSTARTarmourWORDEND,\" say \"our author\" leaves the beheading unmentioned! It is certainly sufficiently implied. To carry tidings unto their idols. This sentence is more clearly explained, and brought into rather unexpected and perhaps unwished accord with the most modern of our ecclesiastical habits, when in the parallel as above, we find \"to publish it in the WORDSTARThouseWORDEND of their idols \"as the form of expression.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles10:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEPULPITVERSEBEGINAnd they put his WORDSTARTarmourWORDEND in the WORDSTARThouseWORDEND of their gods, and fastened his head in the WORDSTARTtempleWORDEND of WORDSTARTDagonWORDEND.PULPITVERSEFINISHNEWLINEVerse 10. - The WORDSTARThouseWORDEND of their gods. In place of this general designation, the parallel (1Sam.31.10) designates the WORDSTARThouseWORDEND more exactly as \"the WORDSTARThouseWORDEND of WORDSTARTAshtarothWORDEND\" (Gen.14.5; the Phoenician female deity, as WORDSTARTBaalWORDEND was their male deity. The WORDSTARTGreekWORDEND form of the name is Astarte. See also Cic., 'De. Nat. Deo.,' 3:23). And fastened his head in the WORDSTARTtempleWORDEND of WORDSTARTDagonWORDEND. The parallel, as above, gives us, \"And fastened his body to the WORDSTARTwallWORDEND of WORDSTARTBethWORDEND-shah\" (which account is corroborated in 2Sam.21.12-2Sam.21.14), and does not say what further was done with the head. It is WORDSTARTnoWORDEND doubt remarkable that one historian puts WORDSTARTonWORDEND record the one fact and the other the other; and it is one of the clearer indications that both took from some common sources. It is perhaps something to be remarked also that, while the historian in WORDSTARTSamuelWORDEND says nothing further about the head (though allusion to it is probably included in the \"body\" and the \"bones,\" the further account of which is given in vers. 12, 13, as WORDSTARTwellWORDEND as in 2Sam.21.12-2Sam.21.14), the compiler of WORDSTARTChroniclesWORDEND does revert to mention of \"the body of WORDSTARTSaulWORDEND,\" ver. 12, infra, though without any corresponding naming of WORDSTARTBethWORDEND-shah. Bertheau finds little difficulty in the question, WORDSTARTbyWORDEND simply supposing that the omission in WORDSTARTChroniclesWORDEND is another instance of the desire to compress; while others suppose corruption in our text, or, as Thenius and Ewald, the loss of a sentence to our text. After all said, the omission in WORDSTARTSamuelWORDEND of the fate of the head would seem to be fully as remarkable as the omission, WORDSTARTsoWORDEND far as this verse is concerned, in WORDSTARTChroniclesWORDEND of the fate of the body. It is reasonable to suppose that the head and trunk of the body of WORDSTARTSaulWORDEND were brought together again, or it were likely some allusion to the contrary would have transpired in the following verses of this WORDSTARTchapterWORDEND or in 2Sam.21.12-2Sam.21.14. With regard to the act of the WORDSTARTPhilistinesWORDEND in dedicating the WORDSTARTarmourWORDEND of WORDSTARTSaulWORDEND, and fixing his head in the WORDSTARTtempleWORDEND of WORDSTARTDagonWORDEND, as though trophies, the WORDSTARTcustomWORDEND was both ancient and not uncommon (Judg.16.21-Judg.16.30; 1Sam.5.1-1Sam.5.5; 1Sam.21.9). The WORDSTARThouseWORDEND of WORDSTARTDagonWORDEND (Josh.15.41; Josh.19.27) here spoken of was that at WORDSTARTAshdodWORDEND (Josh.15.47), between WORDSTARTGazaWORDEND and WORDSTARTJoppaWORDEND. Though belonging to WORDSTARTJudahWORDEND's WORDSTARTlotWORDEND, it was never subdued WORDSTARTbyWORDEND WORDSTARTIsraelWORDEND, and remained throughout their history one of their worst foes. It is the WORDSTARTAzotusWORDEND of Acts.8.40. There was another WORDSTARTDagonWORDEND WORDSTARTtempleWORDEND at WORDSTARTGazaWORDEND (Judg.16.21-Judg.16.31). WORDSTARTDagonWORDEND's representation was the figure of a WORDSTARTmanWORDEND, as to head, hands, and bust, but for the WORDSTARTrestWORDEND that of a WORDSTARTfishWORDEND, which was a symbol of fruitfulness. As WORDSTARTAshdodWORDEND was situate WORDSTARTonWORDEND the extreme west of WORDSTARTPalestineWORDEND, WORDSTARTsoWORDEND WORDSTARTBethWORDEND-shah - generally written WORDSTARTBethWORDEND-shean, a WORDSTARTcityWORDEND of WORDSTARTManassehWORDEND (ch. 7:29), though within the borders of WORDSTARTIssacharWORDEND (Josh.17.11), flora which the WORDSTARTCanaanitesWORDEND were not expelled (Judg.1.27) - was WORDSTARTonWORDEND the extreme WORDSTARTeastWORDEND near the WORDSTARTJordanWORDEND. It was afterwards called Scythopolis. Considering the distance these were apart, and their contrary directions, we may suppose that some suggestion was intended WORDSTARTbyWORDEND the fixing the head in the one place and the body in the other.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles10:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEPULPITVERSEBEGINAnd when all Jabeshgilead heard all that the WORDSTARTPhilistinesWORDEND had done to WORDSTARTSaulWORDEND,PULPITVERSEFINISHNEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles10:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEPULPITVERSEBEGINThey arose, all the valiant men, and took away the body of WORDSTARTSaulWORDEND, and the bodies of his sons, and brought them to WORDSTARTJabeshWORDEND, and buried their bones under the WORDSTARToakWORDEND in WORDSTARTJabeshWORDEND, and fasted WORDSTARTsevenWORDEND days.PULPITVERSEFINISHNEWLINEVerse 12. - WORDSTARTJabeshWORDEND. This is the only place where \"WORDSTARTJabeshWORDEND\" is used as an abbreviation for WORDSTARTJabeshWORDEND-WORDSTARTgileadWORDEND, of which it was the chief WORDSTARTcityWORDEND. WORDSTARTGileadWORDEND comprised the lots of WORDSTARTReubenWORDEND and WORDSTARTGadWORDEND (Num.32.1-Num.32.5, Num.32.25-Num.32.32, Num.32.39-Num.32.41) and of half WORDSTARTManassehWORDEND (1Chr.27.21). WORDSTARTSaulWORDEND had WORDSTARTonWORDEND a celebrated occasion (1Sam.11.1-1Sam.11.13) befriended the people of WORDSTARTJabeshWORDEND-WORDSTARTgileadWORDEND, coming to their rescue against WORDSTARTNahathWORDEND the WORDSTARTAmmoniteWORDEND, of which kindness they are now mindful, show that rarest of virtues, gratitude to a fallen monarch, and are further WORDSTARTonWORDEND (2Sam.2.5) commended for it WORDSTARTbyWORDEND WORDSTARTDavidWORDEND. This verse does not tell us, as the parallel (1Sam.31.12) does, of the first burning of the bodies, and then of the burying of the calcined bones. The silence is very remarkable. It does name the kind of tree, the \"WORDSTARToakWORDEND\" or \"WORDSTARTterebinthWORDEND.\" The word for the tree, however, in both passages is of doubtful and perhaps only generic signification. The several WORDSTARTHebrewWORDEND words translated in various places as \"WORDSTARToakWORDEND,\" all share a common root, significant of the idea of strength. Dr. Thomson ('The Land and the WORDSTARTBookWORDEND,' pp. 243, 244) says that the country owns still to an abundance of oaks of very fine growth in some cases, and that these are exceedingly more plentiful and altogether a stronger tree than the \"WORDSTARTterebinthWORDEND.\" The different names, though all connected with one root, referred to are probably owing to the large variety of oaks. With the statement of the burying of the bones under a tree, and the fasting of WORDSTARTsevenWORDEND days WORDSTARTonWORDEND the part of these brave and grateful men of WORDSTARTJabeshWORDEND-WORDSTARTgileadWORDEND, the parallel account comes to its WORDSTARTendWORDEND.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles10:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEPULPITVERSEBEGINSo WORDSTARTSaulWORDEND died for his transgression which he committed against the LORD, even against the word of the LORD, which he kept not, and also for asking counsel of one that had a WORDSTARTfamiliar spiritWORDEND, to inquire of it;PULPITVERSEFINISHNEWLINEVerse 13. - WORDSTARTSoWORDEND WORDSTARTSaulWORDEND died for his transgression. (For this transgression and the stress laid upon it and its predicted consequences, see 1Sam.15.1-1Sam.15.9, 1Sam.15.11, 1Sam.15.14; 1Sam.28.18.)

WORDSTARTSaulWORDEND seems to have, in point of fact, inquired in some sense (1Sam.14.37; 1Sam.28.5, 1Sam.28.6, 1Sam.28.15). But the probable meaning is that he did not inquire in the first instance (see vers. 3, 4); and when he did inquire, he did not await the reply solely and exclusively of WORDSTARTJehovahWORDEND. Therefore he slew him (WORDSTARTsoWORDEND see 1Chr.2.3). WORDSTARTDavidWORDEND the son of WORDSTARTJesseWORDEND. The compiler, having heretofore given WORDSTARTsoWORDEND scrupulously whatever of genealogical fact he could, is now careful to use it. And he identifies the future chief hero of his history as him who had already been instanced (1Chr.2.15), \"son of WORDSTARTJesseWORDEND.\"NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINE",
    "1Chr.11": "PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Chronicles11:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEPULPITVERSEBEGINThen all WORDSTARTIsraelWORDEND gathered themselves to WORDSTARTDavidWORDEND unto WORDSTARTHebronWORDEND, saying, Behold, we are thy bone and thy WORDSTARTfleshWORDEND.PULPITVERSEFINISHNEWLINEVerse 1. - Upon the WORDSTARTdeathWORDEND of WORDSTARTSaulWORDEND, WORDSTARTAbnerWORDEND, for a while espousing the cause of Ishbo-WORDSTARTshethWORDEND, the only surviving son of WORDSTARTSaulWORDEND, \"made him WORDSTARTkingWORDEND over\" a large proportion of the people, exclusive of WORDSTARTJudahWORDEND (2Sam.2.8-2Sam.2.10). Already WORDSTARTDavidWORDEND had been anointed at WORDSTARTHebronWORDEND WORDSTARTbyWORDEND \"the men of WORDSTARTJudahWORDEND, WORDSTARTkingWORDEND over the WORDSTARThouseWORDEND of WORDSTARTJudahWORDEND\" (2Sam.2.1-2Sam.2.4). And WORDSTARTDavidWORDEND continued \"WORDSTARTkingWORDEND in WORDSTARTHebronWORDEND over the WORDSTARThouseWORDEND of WORDSTARTJudahWORDEND WORDSTARTsevenWORDEND years and six months\" (2Sam.2.11; 2Sam.5.5; 1Kgs.2.11; 1Chr.3.4). Notice the agreement of this WORDSTARTdateWORDEND with the account of the six sons born to WORDSTARTDavidWORDEND in WORDSTARTHebronWORDEND (2Sam.3.2-2Sam.3.5). The explanation of the WORDSTARTchronologyWORDEND for Ishbosheth affecting this period is not easy. It is said that he reigned over WORDSTARTIsraelWORDEND \"two years\" (2Sam.2.10). Where was the difference of five and a half years lost? Our first verse here, with its apparently emphatic then (comp. 2Sam.5.1), would seem to make it very unlikely that it was lost between the WORDSTARTdeathWORDEND of Ishbosheth and the kingship of WORDSTARTDavidWORDEND over \"all the tribes of WORDSTARTIsraelWORDEND\" together with WORDSTARTJudahWORDEND. WORDSTARTOnWORDEND the other WORDSTARThandWORDEND, the interval in question might find its account in the \"long WORDSTARTwarWORDEND (2Sam.3.1, 2Sam.3.6, 2Sam.3.17-2Sam.3.21) between the WORDSTARThouseWORDEND of WORDSTARTSaulWORDEND and the WORDSTARThouseWORDEND of WORDSTARTDavidWORDEND.\" There is, however, still possible the supposition that the historian intends to give the intrinsically correct facts of the case, and means that, what with delay before getting the adhesion of the people to Ishbosheth, and what with the early decay of his sovereign power, he could not be said to have reigned more than two years. This verse, then, shows that the history proper of WORDSTARTChroniclesWORDEND purports to begin from the time of WORDSTARTDavidWORDEND's rule over the entire and united people, at the exact WORDSTARTdateWORDEND of WORDSTARTsevenWORDEND and a half years after WORDSTARTSaulWORDEND's WORDSTARTdeathWORDEND, while WORDSTARTnoWORDEND mention is here made of his intermediate partial rule over WORDSTARTJudahWORDEND, or of Ishbosheth's temporary rule over WORDSTARTBenjaminWORDEND and WORDSTARTIsraelWORDEND. All WORDSTARTIsraelWORDEND; i.e. \"all the tribes of WORDSTARTIsraelWORDEND\" (2Sam.5.1), WORDSTARTbyWORDEND their representatives, \"the elders of WORDSTARTIsraelWORDEND\" (2Sam.3.17; 2Sam.5.3; as WORDSTARTwellWORDEND as our ver. 3). The first nine verses of this WORDSTARTchapterWORDEND cover the same ground as the first ten verses of 2Sam.5. Unto WORDSTARTHebronWORDEND. We learn how WORDSTARTDavidWORDEND came to be here from 2Sam.2.1. \"And it came to pass after this\" (i.e. after WORDSTARTDavidWORDEND's \"WORDSTARTlamentationWORDEND over WORDSTARTSaulWORDEND and WORDSTARTJonathanWORDEND\") \"that WORDSTARTDavidWORDEND inquired of the WORDSTARTLordWORDEND, saying, Shall I go up into any of the cities of WORDSTARTJudahWORDEND? And the WORDSTARTLordWORDEND said unto him, Go up. And WORDSTARTDavidWORDEND said, Whither shall I go up? And he said, Unto WORDSTARTHebronWORDEND.\" WORDSTARTHebronWORDEND was the \"earliest seat of civilized WORDSTARTlifeWORDEND, not of WORDSTARTJudahWORDEND only, but of all WORDSTARTPalestineWORDEND.\" It and WORDSTARTBethlehemWORDEND are two of the most special memorials of WORDSTARTDavidWORDEND. An interesting sketch of the topography and natural features of this place, and a succinct Biblical history of it in Stanley's 'WORDSTARTSinaiWORDEND and WORDSTARTPalestineWORDEND,' p. 164 (edit. 1866), from which comes the following quotation: - \"WORDSTARTHebronWORDEND, according to the Jewish WORDSTARTtraditionWORDEND, was the primeval WORDSTARTcityWORDEND of the WORDSTARTvineWORDEND. Its name indicates community or society. It was the ancient WORDSTARTcityWORDEND of WORDSTARTEphronWORDEND the Hittite, in whose WORDSTARTgateWORDEND he and the elders received the offer of WORDSTARTAbrahamWORDEND, when as yet WORDSTARTnoWORDEND other fixed WORDSTARThabitationWORDEND of WORDSTARTmanWORDEND was known in central WORDSTARTPalestineWORDEND. It was the first home of WORDSTARTAbrahamWORDEND and the patriarchs; their own permanent resting-place when they were gradually exchanging the pastoral for the agricultural WORDSTARTlifeWORDEND. In its neighbourhood can be traced, WORDSTARTbyWORDEND a continuous WORDSTARTtraditionWORDEND, the site of the venerable tree under which WORDSTARTAbrahamWORDEND pitched his WORDSTARTtentWORDEND, and of the double cavern in which he and his family were deposited and perhaps still remain. It was the WORDSTARTcityWORDEND of WORDSTARTArbaWORDEND, the old WORDSTARTCanaaniteWORDEND chief, with his three giant sons, under whose walls the trembling WORDSTARTspiesWORDEND stole through the land WORDSTARTbyWORDEND the adjacent WORDSTARTvalleyWORDEND of Eshcoh Here WORDSTARTCalebWORDEND chose his portion when, at the head of his valiant WORDSTARTtribeWORDEND, he drove out the old inhabitants, and called the whole surrounding territory after his own name; and here the WORDSTARTtribeWORDEND of WORDSTARTJudahWORDEND always rallied, when it asserted its independent existence against the WORDSTARTrestWORDEND of the
